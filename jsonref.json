Belafonte gets the 2015 Cadillac Escalade Brown gets the two 2017 Subaru Outbacks and the two Range Rovers. They split the gym equipment from their former marital home, while Mel alone gets the studio equipment from the house.America\u0027s Got Talent star Mel also gets a Spice Girls video game console that\u0027s particularly precious to her - but she has to pay Belafonte $2,500 for it.The final judgment allowing Mel to keep joint custody of Madison with her ex, was issued after Mel submitted records to the court showing that she had undergone - and passed - several weeks of drug and alcohol testing.Judge Juhas mandated the tests after Brown\u0027s former friend and \u0027manny\u0027 Rusty Updegraff made a damning declaration claiming she was unfit to look after Madison or her sister Angel because her drinking was out of control, she used drugs and often brought home random men to satisfy her ferocious appetite for sex.Updegraff, 59 - who told DailyMail.com that Mel is \u0027the world\u0027s number one bad mother\u0027 - claimed she slept with dozens of men since orcing Belafonte, including her children\u0027s piano teacher, a driver, a hairdresser, a \u0027surfer kid\u0027 and a guy she picked up at SoHo House, who the kids nicknamed \u0027smelly feet\u0027.          Mel was forced to submit drug and alcohol tests for weeks after former friend and \u0027manny\u0027  made a damning declaration claiming she was unfit to look after Madison or her sister Angel because her drinking and drug use was out of control He also accused Mel of sometimes leaving her children unsupervised with some of the men she brought home for sex.Mel - who claim she\u0027s been undergoing therapy for problems with alcohol and post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by her messy orce from Belafonte - denied Updegraff\u0027s claims, calling them \u0027nonsense.\u0027Belafonte and Mel - who split up in March 2017 - were orced last December after a long-running battle in which lurid tales of kinky sex, drug and alcohol abuse and allegations of domestic violence made headlines.Belafonte always denied the allegations and the courts sided with him throwing out a temporary domestic violence restraining order.Despite their orce being final for almost a year, trying to settle complicated issues between them, mostly over children and money dragged on through this summer, with Mel estimating that she\u0027s spent more than $1 million in legal fees and owes another $800,000 to attorneys and accountants.Mel - who also has to pay Belafonte $15,000 a month in spousal support until 2020 - claims the long-drawn-out split with him has ruined her financially, she\u0027s more than $3 million in the red and the IRS has started garnishing her America\u0027s Got Talent salary to pay off hundreds of thousand of dollars in back taxes she owes.The couple were also ordered to set aside $1.1 million - $550,000 each - when they sell their $8 million former marital home, to pay back taxes they owe.  Heartbroken Spice Girl Mel B left with just £800 after her \u0027abusive\u0027 ex-husband Stephen Belafonte seized control of £80m fortune and made her feel \u0027like I was a total waste of space\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/15/08/05C7105E000003E8-6384987-image-a-21_1542271731632.jpg","title":"Sir Elton John revealed star years John Lewis Christmas advert","story":"An emotional Sir Elton John is the star of the 2018 John Lewis Christmas advert, which tells the uplifting and poignant story of his rise to superstardom sparked with the gift of music          Sir Elton appears as himself in the commercial but  is also played by five actors including four-year-old Freddie Henderson, who runs down the stairs on Christmas Day for its moving finale          Elton, then Reg Dwight from Pinner, tears the paper away to reveal a beautiful piano that would inspire him to play          The finale ends with Sir Elton playing the same piano and ends with the message: \u0027Some gifts are more than just a gift\u0027          James Corden is among the stars to have said how good the advert is and declared \u0027holy s**t\u0027 when he shared in online today  Richard Bacon and Susanna Reid also reacted positively to the £7million advert that will be shown on ITV1 tonight  But some critics using the hashtag #Eltonjohnlewis pointed out that the advert has come out as he launches his farewell tour and his biopic movie is out next yearBarbie Kitchen is among the 12 toys named as this year\u0027s...Iceland\u0027s banned Christmas TV ad could become UK\u0027s most...The one Christmas TV advert everyone ought to watch: SIMON...Sainsbury¿s unveils its sweet Christmas campaign featuring a...The Aldi Christmas ad that will steal your heart: Santa...Share this article    John Lewis advertised the piano used in its Christmas advert for £872John Lewis has started selling pianos for the first time today for £872 each.Until this morning the store had not sold the musical instruments for decades.The expensive pianos are \u0027Inspired by our Christmas advert\u0027, according to the John Lewis website, but shoppers can by a cheaper keyboard for £150. Since the advert\u0027s launch they have been victim of a hilarious takedown by budget supermarket Lidl over the price of its showpiece piano.The Yamaha Arius YDP-143 Digital Piano is on sale for £872 after featuring prominently in the commercial, which shows Elton John at the keys from his childhood to superstardom.It is described as being \u0027ideal for any aspiring pianist\u0027 and providing the experience of an \u0027authentic acoustic piano\u0027.But Lidl was quick to balk at the price of the instrument and offer an alternative option on social media.          Lidl then tweeted a tongue-in-cheek advert for an £89 Yamaha keyboardThe German supermarket tweeted: \u0027Just because you don\u0027t have £872 to spend on a piano, doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be the next Elton\u0027, alongside a picture of an £89.99 Yamaha keyboard.The picture is also captioned \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit funny...\u0027 Twitter users were quick to praise the witty response, calling it a \u0027masterstroke\u0027 while one user said \u0027give your marketing manager a rise\u0027.The official John Lewis account then tweeted Lidl a link to its £15 children\u0027s piano with the message: \u0027It\u0027s a Lidl bit cheaper\u0027.One wag replied to both saying: \u0027Do you pair want to leave this argument till the weekend. I’ve heard Saturday nights all right for fighting\u0027 - a joke linked to another of Sir Elton\u0027s big hits.                        Five actors aged between four and 50 were used to play Sir Elton, using prosthetics, CGI and help from the star and his husband David Furnish to ensure they had the same mannerisms and piano playing style.Viewers are taken back through key moments in his life with scenes of the star on stadium tours, travelling on a private jet, recording Your Song, playing the piano in a local pub and performing in a school recital. It ends with Sir Elton - then little Reg Dwight - running down the stairs on Christmas morning to see his grandmother Ivy and his mother, who brought him up together because his father, Stanley, was largely absent.John Lewis has said the advert is \u0027inspired by real events\u0027 but admits the finale involves \u0027some creativity\u0027 because the singer was never gifted a piano at Christmas, but he had learned to play at his grandmother\u0027s house - and denied claims they paid him £5million to take part. It is also the second of the retailer\u0027s Christmas ads to feature Your Song after singer Ellie Goulding recorded a cover for the 2010 campaign. The  nod to Elton\u0027s mother and the influence on his career comes almost a year after her death last December.Two years before she passed away the star found the courage to apologise to her after a nearly nine-year feud that culminated in her inviting an Elton John impersonator to perform at her 90th birthday party because she missed him so much.Elton severed all contact with her after a catastrophic argument where she blamed Elton\u0027s husband, David Furnish, for turning him against her.She was also upset the Candle In The Wind singer demanded she cut all ties with her longtime friends Bob Halley and John Reid, who  worked for him for decades.But he later sent Sheila a large bouquet of white orchids for her milestone birthday and also shelled out £30,000 for Sheila to undergo a double hip replacement.When she died last year Elton spoke of his grief - but happiness that they had become close again.In September this year rumours emerged that Sir Elton had agreed to take part - but John Lewis has denied he was paid the £5million fee being mooted. They also said some of his fee was donated to charity.The musician said today: \u0027The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family.\u0027It\u0027s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey I have been on, and how first playing my grandmother\u0027s piano marks the moment when music came into my life.\u0027The ad is absolutely fantastic and I\u0027ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u0027His husband David Furnish, who was involved in producing the advert, said:  \u0027I think Elton has enjoyed the process of making this tremendously. \u0027I think, you know, emotionally he is thinking about the journey he’s been on as an artist, and that moment, you know, when music came into his life at a very young age when he was encouraged by his mother and his grandmother with his piano\u0027. The Boy \u0026amp The Piano was released online at 8am this morning before being shown on ITV at 9.15pm tonight.Actor Simon Burbage plays Elton in the 1980s and 1990, while the lookalike used to recreate the scenes from the 1970s is Oliver Marshall. The singer as a teenager is played by Brandon Stein, while Hudson Trindall is performing at a piano recital and the young boy on Christmas morning is Freddie Henderson.           Sir Elton sings his first big hit Your Song in a present day gig but the advert goes all the way back to his 1950s childhood          Actor Oliver Marshall wearing prosthetics and original clothes is shown performing on his stadium tour on the West Coast with the crowds recreated using CGI          Viewers are also transported into his tour plane in the 1970s when he became a global superstar and multi-millionaire      Sir Elton, again using an actor, is shown performing Your Song on TV and then recording it for an album in 1970  In the 1960s the star first started performing in the Northwood Hills pub in Pinner, around the corner from where he grew up  Elton, played by Hudson Trindall, is shown performing in a school recital watched by his family in an advert inspired by events in his life (pictured, right, Elton as a child)           The heart of the advert is revealed at the end as Elton as a young boy tears the paper from the piano in front of his grandmother and mother, played by Deborah Baxter and Katie Bonna (left to right)          The child actor looks in wonder at the musical instrument with the message that gifts can inspire and change lives          The final scene shows Elton playing the same piano himself, although John Lewis admit while he learned to play with his grandmother he never received one as a Christmas giftJohn Lewis addressed speculation about the cost of this year\u0027s ad, describing reports that it had paid Sir Elton £5million as \u0027wildly inaccurate\u0027 and said the ad cost £7million with most of the money going on advertising spending.          Sir Elton said his mother Sheila (pictured together at his 50th birthday party in 1997) was an inspiration to him - but they had an eight-year feud before having a reconciliation two years before she died last DecemberIt added that Sir Elton had requested that a portion of his fee be donated to the Elton John Charitable Trust when he was first approached to be involved.  John Lewis customer director Craig Inglis said: \u0027The ad tells the story of why Elton\u0027s piano was more than just a gift and we hope to remind customers of that special moment when they\u0027ve given a gift at Christmas time that they know will be treasured forever.\u0027The retailer, which reported a 98.8 per cent profits crash for the first half of the year in September, said the ad was a \u0027crucial part\u0027 of its overall marketing campaign and \u0027one of the most effective marketing campaigns in the industry, delivering an excellent return on investment\u0027.John Lewis and Waitrose employees have been given the first opportunity to share the two minute and 20 second ad at 6am on Thursday before its launch on the store\u0027s social media channels, its website and in shops at 8am.The ad first airs on television on Thursday at 9.15pm during ITV\u0027s Dark Heart, although ITV viewers may have noticed that the theme tunes to some of the channel\u0027s shows including Coronation Street and This Morning were played solely in piano notes on Wednesday to tease the advert\u0027s premiere.Customers at the retailer\u0027s flagship Oxford Street branch can also step into a 2,000 square foot recreation of the ad production set to try on some of the costumes, listen to recordings from Elton John\u0027s 17-11-70 album and have photos taken at the piano.

Best ad since the penguins\u0027.   Elton John faces backlash for featuring his mother in John Lewis Christmas ad despite arguing with her for years           Sir Elton, pictured with his mother Sheila  after being knighted in 1998, had a series of damaging rows with her but they reconciled just before she diedSir Elton John healed the long and painful rift with his mother Sheila five months before her death last December  - but he has faced a backlash for featuring their relationship in the John Lewis Christmas advert released today.The star, 71, had been estranged from Mrs Farebrother for around nine years until May 2017 following rows over mutual friends and his husband David Furnish.Mrs Farebrother had encouraged her son to play piano from the age of three and was a constant throughout the majority of his extraordinary career.But their relationship faltered when she was in her 80s and she said two years ago her son \u0027hated\u0027 her after a series of bitter public rows.When she turned ninety she even invited an Elton John lookalike to perform because she missed him so much Despite their reconciliation last year some viewers of the John Lewis ad said it was wrong to put their sometimes rocky relationship at its heart.One fan said while watching today\u0027s advert: \u0027All I could think was: didn\u0027t Elton John famously cut his mum out of his life for years?\u0027 Another said: \u0027Nice ad for, erm... Elton John. Didn’t he refuse to speak to his mother for years? Nice that he appreciated her eventually\u0027, while one critic tweeted: \u0027Remember the time that Elton John’s mum hired an Elton John lookalike to play at her party? That didn’t make the cut into that ad\u0027.But others saw the other side and said: \u0027Such an emotional journey, so gripping, so true to life for so many people and heartfelt especially after @eltonofficial losing his Mother. Well done John Lewis this year!\u0027.Another added: \u0027I was quite moved by #JohnLewisChristmasAd. The power of music and a mother\u0027s love combined. Lovely\u0027.Mother and son\u0027s relationship appeared hit rock bottom in 2016, two years after he married Mr Furnish. Sheila had been a witness at their civil partnership in 2005.Sir Elton said: \u0027I don’t miss her. When she says things in the press, like, “I haven’t spoken to Elton since he married that f****** a****** David Furnish”. That was pretty hard to take\u0027.He added: \u0027I don’t hate my mother. I look after her but I don’t want her in my life.’But they made up fully around six months before she died last year, shortly after he was hospitalised for 12 days, including two nights in intensive care, after picking up a serious infection while touring South America.In May 2017 he confirmed they were close again after he shared a throwback picture on Twitter to celebrate reconnecting with Mrs Farebrother on America\u0027s Mother\u0027s Day with the message: \u0027So happy we are back in touch. Love, Elton.\u0027Mother and son fell out in 2008 after she allegedly refused his request not to talk to two of their oldest friends.          Sheila and Elton at the height of his fame in 1976 - she has been credited for being a driving force behind his career          1947: Elton John is born Reginald Dwight on March 25 to father Stanley and mother Sheila. As he grew up his father was largely absent and his mum encouraged him to play the piano from the age of three.His parents orce and Sheila remarries his stepfather John, and the couple encourage him to write songs and get him a job as a pub pianist age 15. She remained a strong and constant support during his long career. 2008: Mother and son fall out after a row over mutual friends and his husband David Furnish\u0027s influence on his career2015: Mrs Farebrother said that her son \u0027hated\u0027 her and gets an an Elton John impersonator at her 90th birthday party. He then sends a bunch of white orchids - his first contact for seven years. May 2017: He posts a US mother\u0027s day message saying he is \u0027happy they\u0027re in touch\u0027 - confirming they had reconciled their differences.December 4, 2017: Sheila Farebrother dies aged 92.                                                    This was further inflamed when she claimed that Elton never told her she had become a grandmother when boys Elijah and Zachary were born.In 2015 she told the Daily Mail that her son had called out of the blue and ordered her to cut off all contact with Bob Halley - Sir Elton\u0027s driver turned personal assistant - and John Reid, with whom he had fallen out.Mrs Farebrother, who lived in a bungalow on the South Coast, said: \u0027I told him: \u0027I\u0027m not about to do that and drop them. Bob is like a son to me. He has always been marvellous to me and he lives nearby and keeps an eye on me\u0027.\u0027She said Sir Elton flew into an expletive-filled rage, adding: \u0027To my utter amazement, he told me he hated me.\u0027And he banged the phone down. Imagine! To me, his mother!\u0027She is said to have told him during the row: \u0027I said to him, And you think more of that f***ing thing you married than your own mother.\u0027During that period, however, it is understood Sir Elton continued to support Sheila financially and to provide a roof over her head, despite all that has passed between them.He is also said to have paid £30,00 for her double hip replacement.At one point she filled the void left by her son with a tribute act to the pop star.Sheila Farebrother hired him to provide the entertainment at her 90th birthday in March 2015 and would send emails to Mr Bacon, who himself described their link as \u0027quite surreal\u0027.Prompted by the milestone birthday, Sir Elton got in touch with his mother for the first time in seven years, sending her white orchids.They then continued to work on their relationship until their reconciliation was properly confirmed by Sir Elton in May 2017.The star last saw her a week before she died.When it was announced on December 4 last year he said he was in \u0027complete shock\u0027.He also posted a photograph of them together in happier times and wrote on Instagram: \u0027So sad to say that my mother passed away this morning. I only saw her last Monday and I am in shock. Travel safe Mum. Thank-you for everything. I will miss you so much. Love, Elton\u0027.The singer says he has been spurred on to shower his sons with affection because he received none from his own father.Elton took a swipe at his late father Stanley Dwight while giving a speech in which he said a lack of love had led him to drink and drugs.He said recently: \u0027I never stop telling them I love them, and they never stop telling me they love me\u0027.          Elton John, then 24, at home with his mother Theresa and stepfather Fred in 1971, and the couple were his rock for many years but his own father Stanley was largely absent      John Lewis\u0027 2017 Christmas advert has left viewers in tears over a mischievous and flatulent monster called Moz and  his relationship with a seven-year-old soulmate - with fans comparing it to Disney\u0027s much-loved Monsters Inc.The giant furry monster with a bulbous nose, wonky teeth and a love of snoring, jumps out from under the bed every night to play with companion Joe in a festive tale making many  laugh and cry.The little boy, aged 7, who is played by young twin brothers from London named Ethan and Tobias, is initially frightened after seeing a pair of enormous eyes peering from the dark under his bed.But the two unlikely friends are shown sharing games, playing piggyback and Scalextric in his bedroom – all without mum, dad, or older sister finding out.Moz then leaves his friend as he realises the little boy needs to grow up without him and wraps a farewell gift for him under the Christmas tree - a nightlight to help him sleep.Elbow performed The Beatles\u0027 Abbey Road masterpiece Golden Slumbers as the soundtrack.2016 Last year\u0027s star was Buster the Boxer and his trampoline antics.John Lewis said the advert where the dog, played by five-year-old Biff, beats a young girl to her new toy is their attempt to cheer up Britain after a \u0027tough year\u0027.The advert told the story of a little girl called Bridget who loves to jump.Set to a cover version of \u0027One Day I\u0027ll Fly Away\u0027, her mother and father buy her a trampoline, toiling while she sleeps to build it before hiding it in the garden to surprise her with on Christmas Day. As the snow falls an array of animals start using it as the Boxer watches forlornly through the window.The next morning Bridget sprints out to use it for the first time but her joy turns to shock as cheeky Buster has the last laugh and uses her new toy  before her.2015A lonely Man on the Moon is shown to viewers sitting by himself on a bench, completely unaware that he is being observed by the youngster back down on EarthThe elderly man, played by a 77-year-old French actor called Jean, gazes up wistfully towards the Earth, as the Oasis song Half The World Away, performed by 19-year-old Norwegian singer Aurora plays mournfully in the background.She tries desperately to send him a message but all her efforts fail, while he remains unaware that anyone cares about him and sits alone on a bench, wistfully staring up at the Earth.Eventually, on Christmas morning, a present arrives from the sky, carried by party balloons, and the old man unwraps it to reveal a vintage telescope.He uses it to spot Lily and, realising that someone cares about him, his eyes fill with tears.2014John Lewis hoped the bond between a boy and a penguin would capture the public\u0027s imagination.The two-minute festive commercial told the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by actor Rhys Edwards from Hertfordshire, and his friend Monty.The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.The soundtrack was John Lennon\u0027s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell.2013The £7million Disney-inspired advert told the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his best friend, a bear, doesn\u0027t miss Christmas for once.The commercial features the tale of two good friends, a bear and a hare, who are sad at the thought of being separated for Christmas.The tale opens as winter is starting to draw in and the fun and excitement of preparing for Christmas begins.As the first snowflake falls and lands on the bear\u0027s nose, the hare starts to feel sad because he realises his friend will soon go off to hibernate, so – as usual - missing Christmas.While the bear is keen to join in, eventually he finds he cannot hold off his winter sleep any longer and disappears into his cave.Viewers see the bear fast asleep while all the other woodland creatures become excited about the big day to come.However, the hare is missing his friend and finds it increasingly difficult to join in the preparations until the moment he has a great idea for a very special present.He disappears off in to the wilderness to return with the gift – an alarm clock – which wakes the bear just in time to gather around a beautifully decorated tree to celebrate with all his friends.2012The Christmas ad, called The Journey, shows the extraordinary lengths to which some will go in their search for a gift for someone they love.The 90-second commercial opens in a family\u0027s snow-covered garden, with children happily making a snowman and snowwoman.When the snowman mysteriously disappears the next morning, the viewer is transported to a magical world, following him on an epic journey across river, mountain, road and city.The motive for the snowman\u0027s secret journey isn\u0027t revealed until the last scene, when he returns on Christmas morning with gifts for his wife.Newcomer Gabrielle Aplin sings The Power Of Love, the 1984 hit from Frankie Goes To Hollywood, as the soundtrack. 2011In 2011, the John Lewis advert showed a young boy so desperately excited about Christmas that he couldn\u0027t wait to give presents to his parents.It was accompanied by a cover of The Smiths\u0027 Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\u0027.2010And the 2010 offering saw iniduals choosing and wrapping their presents in the lead up to the big day, as Ellie Goulding sings a cover of Elton John\u0027s Your Song.Various people furtively hide the presents they\u0027ve carefully chosen: parents sneak a rocking horse upstairs while their children\u0027s backs are turned a mechanic struggles to wrap a spotted teapot and a small boy braves the snow in his dressing gown to hang a stocking outside his dog\u0027s kennel.2009This was the first of the store\u0027s Christmas campaigns created by advertising agency Adam \u0026amp Eve, now adam\u0026ampeveDDB, and the first to feature a musical cover by a current artist, on this occasion a Taken By Trees version of Sweet Child O\u0027 Mine by Guns N\u0027 Roses.The ad shows children opening gifts for adults including a laptop, coffee machine and handbag, followed by the tagline: \u0027Remember how Christmas used to feel? Give someone that feeling.\u00272008Culminating in the tagline: \u0027If you know the person, you\u0027ll find the present,\u0027 it shows a succession of characters followed by a matching gift.The soundtrack is a cover of The Beatles\u0027 From Me To You recorded for the campaign, with vocals by Matt Spinner, a member of the John Lewis IT department and its music society.2007The ad shows a group of people stacking a pile of potential gifts including a desktop lamp, a computer and a leather satchel in an empty room. The finished product ends up creating a shadow that looks like a woman walking her dog through the snow, accompanied by the tagline: \u0027Whoever you\u0027re looking for this Christmas.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"John Lewis divides fans not Christmassy Elton John advert","story":"    James Corden is among the stars to have said how good the advert is and declared \u0027holy s**t\u0027 when he shared in online today  Richard Bacon and Susanna Reid also reacted positively to the £7million advert that will be shown on ITV1 tonight          Others said the advert was more about Sir Elton John than about Christmas It\u0027s ELTON John Lewis!

An emotional Sir Elton John is the star of the 2018 John Lewis Christmas advert, which tells the uplifting and poignant story of his rise to superstardom sparked with the gift of music          Elton, then Reg Dwight from Pinner, tears the paper away to reveal a beautiful piano that would inspire him to play  In the 1960s the star first started performing in the Northwood Hills pub in Pinner, around the corner from where he grew up          Actor Oliver Marshall wearing prosthetics and original clothes is shown performing on his stadium tour on the West Coast with the crowds recreated using CGI          Viewers are also transported into his tour plane in the 1970s when he became a global superstar and multi-millionaire          The finale shows Sir Elton playing the same piano and ends with the message: \u0027Some gifts are more than just a gift\u0027But on her 90th birthday he sent Sheila a large bouquet of white orchids for her milestone birthday and also shelled out £30,000 for Sheila to undergo a double hip replacement.When she died two years later he spoke of his grief - but happiness that they had become close again.In September rumours emerged that Sir Elton had agreed to take part - but John Lewis has denied he was paid the £5million fee being mooted. They also said some of his fee was donated to charity.The musician said today: \u0027The John Lewis Christmas campaign has so many warm memories for me and my family.\u0027It\u0027s been a lovely opportunity for me to reflect on my life in music and the incredible journey I have been on, and how first playing my grandmother\u0027s piano marks the moment when music came into my life.\u0027The ad is absolutely fantastic and I\u0027ve truly loved every minute of being a part of it.\u0027His husband David Furnish, who was involved in producing the advert, said: \u0027I think Elton has enjoyed the process of making this tremendously. I think, you know, emotionally he is thinking about the journey he’s been on as an artist, and that moment, you know, when music came into his life at a very young age when he was encouraged by his mother and his grandmother with his piano\u0027.The Boy \u0026amp The Piano was released online at 8am this morning before being shown on ITV at 9.15pm tonight.The advert coincides with the start of ticket sales Sir Elton worldwide farewell tour and next year Taron Egerton will play him in Rocketman, the biopic film being made about the star, with his blessing, due for release next year.John Lewis says the movie and tour is unrelated to their choice of star and advert, which was filmed over the summer."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/15/22/326BE8F300000578-6395507-Christchurch_s_picturesque_town_harbour-a-132_1542321447116.jpg","title":"Picturesque towns high street named best UK","story":"    Crickhowell, on the edge of the Brecon Beacons, was named winner of the Great British High Street Awards.

One of the first cartoons to use synchronized sound and music, the film would make Mickey a star. One of the first rooms of the exhibition pays homage to that film, which also featured Mickey’s sweetheart Minnie Mouse. A big steamboat takes center stage and comes equipped with a functioning ship’s wheel that can be whirled. Nearby is Steamboat Redux, which has two screens. One, on the left shows the original film, and, the other, on the right, shows artists reimagining its scenes.‘Took the original Steamboat Willie short, we chopped it up in about 35 scenes and we asked each animator or artist to be as graphically interpretative as they could,’ explained John T. Quinn, who produced and directed the Redux. ‘We used the original soundtrack, the original layout so that the film continuity holds together.’Quinn told DailyMail.com that it took about two and a half years to do the film, and many animators wanted the famous scene where Mickey is whistling. Included in the Redux film, he said, are many different types of animation: stop motion, hand-drawn on paper and computer, and CG or computer-generated.Ever since he was a kid, Quinn said he wanted to work for Disney as an artist, and now that he does, ‘it’s really a dream come true.

I use it a reference a lot in my work because it kind of embodies LA in many ways,’ she said, who lives in Los Angeles, and adding that she was so obsessed with Disney she considered working there as a princess - Snow White - for one of her first jobs.Superimposed on the bedroom scene is a shadow of the forest, she said, which adds a ‘little bit of darkness and mystery, which is a lot of what Disney is to me – it’s the light and dark and mystery.’ Near Papademetropoulous’ piece is Katherine Bernhardt’s mural called ‘99Cent Hot Dog.’‘It features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and hot dogs with mustard,’ Bernhardt said. ‘I did that because I like humor in art and I think hot dogs are funny.’Bernhardt usually does paintings but was excited to do a mural, which was painted directly on the wall using house paint.          Katherine Bernhardt (pictured) stands in front of her mural called ‘99Cent Hot Dog.’ Using house paint, Bernhardt painted directly on the wall, and said the mural features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and hot dogs with mustard. ‘I did that because I like humor in art and I think hot dogs are funny,’ Bernhardt told DailyMail.com           Shinique Smith (pictured) stands in front of her piece called ‘Bale Variant No. 0026, (Ode to Mickey Mouse, My First Love).’ Smith said Mickey  was important to her growing up and told DailyMail.com she is a \u0027Disney girl.\u0027 Smith said her piece is comprised of Mickey Mouse plush toys throughout the ages.

In front of the photo, encased in glass is an honorary Oscar Disney was awarded in 1932 for the creation of Mickey Mouse.Next up are rooms in black and white that feature Mickey’s first film, ‘Plane Crazy,’ and the artwork of Daniel Arsham called ‘Hiding Mickey’ – the large white Mickey that seems to be bulging out of the wall.Arsham ‘celebrates Mickey’s timeless form in his signature renowned style of stretching figures along the wall,’ Romanelli told DailyMail.com in an interview. ‘It’s giant, it’s so big and it’s coming out of the wall. So architecturally, he’s playing with space – something so iconic as a mouse behind the wall.’Singer and songwriter James Fauntleroy created a song to accompany Arsham’s installation, Romanelli said, and visitors have the option of putting on the headphones and ‘getting a bit lost in the audio file as well as the visual experience or just taking it in visually.’          Ariana Papademetropoulous (pictured) stands next to her painting called ‘My Mother’s Bedroom in 1979\u0027 that features a ceramic figurine of Mickey Mouse on her mom’s bedside table. Growing up, Papademetropoulous said she was ‘very much into Mickey Mouse’ and drew him oftenThere is fun to be had in the ‘Fantasia’ room, which is called Sorcerer’s Way: look into the two wells and there are the original pencil sketches for the 1940 film, which is set to classical music and is about Mickey playing while the sorcerer is away. The sketches are out of the archives for the first time and were animated. A giant replica of the sorcerer hat that Mickey puts on during the film and where people can stand under is one of the many photo opportunities throughout the exhibition.After indulging in brooms and wizard’s caps, the next room has a different type of nostalgia to luxuriate in: the Mickey Mouse Club. The show has gone through many iterations, and, depending on your age, a visitor may yearn for Annette Funicello, part of the original show from the 1950s, or the many stars - Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Keri Russell and Ryan Gosling – from the All-New Mickey Mouse Club that started airing in 1989 until 1994.Romanelli, the curator, said: ‘Those were such important years, you know, being a teenager and not wanting to grow out of being a kid but also wanting to.’He laughed and added: ‘It was definitely an important chapter for me. We have a Mickey Mouse Club room where we recreated the 90s set to a tee so for anybody in my age demo that walks in that room, it should resonate.’Monitors placed around the set show a young Spears and Timberlake singing and dancing their out heart.Also in that room is an intriguing artwork by Brian Bress. Romanelli explained that Bress drew Mickey Mouse 2,000 times, then built a suit for himself covered in those drawings. The video, titled ‘Exactly (Mickey Mouse),’ shows a white piece of paper drawn with black and white Mickey figures. Bress, who is dressed in a suit that matches that foreground, cuts pieces out of it, revealing him in the background. It is artwork that is ever shifting and constantly changing.           Pictured above is Keith Haring\u0027s 1981 \u0027Untitled (Mickey Mouse).\u0027 Haring, who died in 1990, is known for his pop art that included chalk outlines drawn on New York City subways.

She arrived alone. She pulled up her car in front of our house. I greeted her at the door.\u0027           Festus Onasanya also used a similar ‘method’ involving fake driver details, when he was caught speeding on June 17 and August 23 last yearDr DeFeo said Onasanya, his wife and himself spent no less than two hours discussing the \u0027nitty gritty\u0027 of a charity lease in his living room.They were there together throughout apart from the occasional \u0027loo breaks\u0027 and his wife going into the kitchen to prepare a \u0027hot lemon squash\u0027. The Peterborough MP allegedly conspired with her brother Festus to offload the blame when her Nissan Micra was caught speeding in July last year.Jurors were told that Mr Onasanya, 33, a singer from Chesterton, Cambridge, used a similar \u0027method\u0027 involving fake driver details, when he was caught speeding on June 17 and August 23 last year.He has already pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey  to perverting the course of justice in relation to the incidents, as well as to the charge incident involving his sister.Miss Onasanya, a former solicitor who is now a Labour whip responsible for party discipline, deliberately gave police false details so they could not trace the real driver, jurors at the Old Bailey were told.The investigation was triggered when the MP\u0027s Nissan Micra was detected driving at 41mph in a 30mph zone at 10.03pm on July 24 last year in Thorney, Cambridgeshire.The MP, who had risen for Parliament\u0027s summer recess several days earlier, replied to a notice of intended prosecution (NIP) naming Mr Antipow as the driver.Officers became suspicious when they unsuccessfully tried to contact Mr Antipow, and found that the address and phone number on the document were false.The court heard how analysis of records for Miss Onasanya\u0027s two mobile phones placed her in the area where the speeding offence took place.Prosecutor David Jeremy said: \u0027Mr Antipow does exist, but he was not driving Ms Onasanya\u0027s car.\u0027 Miss Onasanya became \u0027trapped in a number of lies\u0027 when she decided to \u0027adopt her brother\u0027s method of evading prosecution\u0027, jurors were told.Mr Jeremy said: \u0027This case did start as an offence of speeding. It has become, as a result of the choices made by Miss Onasanya, a case about lying.\u0027Lying persistently and deliberately, lying all the way to this court and, it may be, even lying in this court. Lying in a way that has had to be coordinated with lies told by her brother.\u0027Mr Antipow was connected to the siblings due to living in a property that they rented in Chesterton for several months in 2016.Investigators found that Mr Onasanya had previously lived at the false address for Mr Antipow that was provided on the prosecution notice, while its occupants are said to be linked to him.A phone number supposedly belonging to the Russian was traced back to a company called IT Fleet Automotive, where Mr Onasanya worked as a self-employed delivery driver, it was claimed.When the original prosecution letter to Mr Antipow was returned to police due to the incorrect address, officers wrote to the MP in September asking her to clarify the details.When another NIP letter was sent to Mr Antipow and again received no response, investigators repeatedly failed in their attempts to get hold of Miss Onasanya.She told investigators in November that Mr Antipow had filled in his own details on the returned speeding form.When the MP eventually agreed to attend a voluntary interview at Bedford police headquarters on January 2 this year, she refused to answer questions.Mr Jeremy said: \u0027What a shame she did not tell the truth from the beginning\u0027.\u0027By this time Miss Onasanya would have known that she and her brother had a problem - that the speeding allegations had not gone away and been fobbed off using Festus\u0027s method.\u0027Miss Onasanya denies one count of perverting the course of justice.

Over the next four months, letters poured in from all over the world, bearing loving messages and words of comfort to the man who’d given them so much pleasure through his music and humour.Some — like those from Emma Thompson, Billy Joel and Phil Collins (who wrote a three-page fan letter) — were from people who didn’t know him personally but wanted to be part of a massive outpouring of affection for him.Among them was a parody, by Paul McCartney, of The Beatles hit When I’m Sixty-Four a caricature of Dudley with ribald comments from the Rolling Stones scribbled around his face and loving notes from Elton John, Bette Midler, Whoopi Goldberg, Jack Lemmon, Mel Brooks, Michael Caine, Neil Simon and hundreds more.Some tried to make him smile. ‘Many happy returns from someone who is just over a year older (and still slightly taller),’ wrote Alan Bennett, while Billy Joel confided: ‘I’m not much taller than you and I think I understand how uncomfortable it can be carrying an oversized set of b***s on such short legs.’          Having appeared in the film Ten in 1978, above, he’d been surprised to be offered a cameo role in Barbra Streisand’s romantic comedy, The Mirror Has Two Faces. This would be Dudley’s chance to remind people of the talents that once made him the toast of HollywoodDuring all this time, I was bombarded by calls from concerned friends. ‘I didn’t know he was ill,’ Kelsey Grammer fretted. ‘What’s wrong with him?’ It was a question that nobody could answer.American musician-producer Quincy Jones rang me one night after I’d started to run a bath. For 15 minutes he talked about the magic of Dudley, his wonderful spirit and how much he loved him. I spent the next half-hour mopping the flood in my bathroom.By the time I’d assembled all the letters, they filled two massive albums, which I packaged and sent to Dudley. He was overwhelmed. ‘I found it enormously touching,’ he told me. ‘I thought it was extraordinary that they would write me letters that expressed their feelings about me. Such a surprise. It was amazing.‘It gave me some encouragement to think a bit more pleasantly about myself, and to think more positively about myself.’The first sign of a problem had come on the first day of shooting of Dudley’s final film. It was the mid-Nineties, and his triumphs in Arthur and 10 were far behind him. So he’d been surprised to be offered a cameo role in Barbra Streisand’s romantic comedy, The Mirror Has Two Faces. This would be Dudley’s chance to remind people of the talents that once made him the toast of Hollywood. Except it didn’t turn out that way.As the cameras rolled, he found he simply couldn’t remember his lines. Even writing them on giant cue cards wasn’t helping, because he was finding it hard to focus. Afterwards, Dudley retreated to his trailer, so upset that he refused to have any lunch. ‘Something is happening to me and I don’t know what,’ he told journalist and friend Rena Fruchter and me.          Dudley Moore, centre, in Blame in on the Bellboy in 1992. By the time I’d assembled all the letters for his birthday just a few years later, they filled two massive albums, which I packaged and sent to Dudley. He was overwhelmedRena and I thought we knew the answer. Nicole Rothschild had happened to him, and the once irrepressible Dudley, who lit up rooms with his warmth and raucous laughter, was increasingly sinking into depression.As it turned out, we were only partially right. Half his age, Nicole had met him a few years earlier through the simple stratagem of stopping him in the street and begging for his autograph. Never able to resist an attractive woman, Dudley plunged into an affair.His latest leggy girlfriend was eight inches taller than him and came loaded with problems. While still married to her first husband, she’d gone through a bigamous marriage with Charles Cleveland, a self-confessed drug addict, and had two children with him.          Dudley Moore with his wife, Nicole Rothschild, and their baby, born in 1995. Buckling down for the first time to do up to six hours of practice a day, he’d blossomed into a critically acclaimed concert pianist —admired by, among others, the great conductor Sir Georg Solti and the violinist Itzhak PerlmanSo obsessed was Dudley with his new lover that he helped the couple financially throughout their ‘marriage’. Then, when Nicole decided to leave Cleveland, he bought her a house around the corner from his home in California, and gave her a 20,000-dollar sports car and a monthly allowance.That wasn’t all: he continued supporting her ex-husband, who was now HIV positive, and their two children. Plus he bought cars for both Cleveland and Nicole’s sister, and a flat in Las Vegas for Cleveland’s mother.If that seemed outrageously philanthropic, Dudley’s friends knew it was typical behaviour. He’d always taken on responsibility for the families of long-term girlfriends or wives, just as he’d always insisted on having the freedom to sleep around.          Classical musician Rena Fruchter with Moore in Washington. In his final years, he lived with her along with her partner Brian DallowSo despite his infatuation with Nicole, he was still enjoying the company of other women, among them Quincy Jones’s daughter Jolie. Why did he stay with Nicole?Their relationship became ‘a union created in hell’, as one of his friends described it.No one could understand the dynamics that kept them together, because they were such opposites. While Dudley was meticulous and rational, Nicole was volatile, often irrational and as changeable as the English weather.These differences triggered endless fights, often resulting in Dudley — all 5ft 2½in of him — emerging scratched and bruised. Somehow they always kissed and made up.Eventually Nicole persuaded him to marry her. First he had to get his lawyers to track down her first husband and get that marriage annulled, as Nicole had married Cleveland without an annulment.Soon she was pregnant with their son, Nicholas. Dudley, however, felt trapped in a cycle of abuse, remorse and apology — yet strangely helpless to do anything about it.The night before he forgot his lines on Streisand’s new movie, Nicole had rung him several times in the early hours. She announced that she was moving the household to Telluride, a small mountain town in Colorado, where Dudley had already given in to her latest whim and put down a deposit on another home.Little wonder that he was distracted. He’d already arranged to move there with Nicole her phone calls were because she didn’t want to wait until he returned to LA a week later — she wanted to move immediately. She was a very impulsive woman.‘I just want to play the piano and have everyone leave me alone,’ he said despairingly to Rena, herself a renowned pianist.          Dudley Moore and Peter Cook in 1993. ‘I don’t visualise myself at concerts, and I’m not obsessed by images of myself at the piano,’ he said. ‘You get used to the idea of saying: “Goodbye, goodbye, practical world…”In a break from filming, Dudley flew back to California, determined to commit all his lines to memory. But he wasn’t surprised when his agent rang a few days later to report that Streisand was cutting him loose from the film.Still puzzled by his sudden memory problems, Dudley decided to have some medical tests. Having ruled out every common brain disorder, however, his doctors pronounced themselves mystified.Dudley’s only obvious problem seemed to be the continuing turmoil in his personal life. It would be another two years before doctors were finally able to diagnose what was really wrong with him.Instrument of war: Violin built by hero soldier, who was...Share this articleDudley’s amazing facility to switch between acting, comedy, writing film scores and playing jazz had already made him one of the most versatile and multi-faceted performers of our time.In mid-life, he’d also developed another major talent. Buckling down for the first time to do up to six hours of practice a day, he’d blossomed into a critically acclaimed concert pianist —admired by, among others, the great conductor Sir Georg Solti and the violinist Itzhak Perlman.          Cook and Moore in Goodbye Again. For too long, Dudley realised, he’d been too wrapped up in his personal life. Now it was time to take care of himself and focus on his workMore recently, spurred on and tutored by Rena, he’d mastered Grieg’s Piano Concerto, which was released as a CD. Despite Dudley’s love of acting and comedy, it was music that gave him the most fulfilment. For him, it was the more visceral art, the one through which he became emotionally recharged.As his old music tutor, Peter Cork, observed: ‘What is incredible is how he does brilliantly with one career then opens up in another. But in the end it comes back to the one thing that was always the most overwhelming — his music.’After the Streisand debacle, however, Dudley seemed almost to have given up. Now living in Telluride, surrounded by the chaos of Nicole’s family, he abandoned his daily piano practice.He’d lost confidence, believing he no longer had a place in the world of entertainment. ‘I know it’s sad because I have so much to give,’ he told me, ‘but I’ve tried to come back and people don’t like what I do. I’m resigned to that.’Rena was alarmed. They’d been booked to perform some concerts together, so she flew out from New York several times to see him.Gently, she encouraged him back to the keyboard and managed to rekindle his passion. Over time, it became clear Dudley depended on her for the security that was otherwise lacking in his life.Nicole had been up to her usual antics. On one of her whims, she decided to open a shop selling children’s clothes and furniture, and Dudley had paid 60,000 dollars for the merchandise.Then, two months after he moved to Colorado, she decided they should go back to California. The shop never opened.After settling back into the two homes in LA’s Marina del Rey — his and hers — they resumed their pattern of blistering rows and abuse. There was yet more turmoil when Dudley discovered that his business manager had misappropriated several million dollars of his savings.In an effort to raise money, Dudley tried to sell the flat he’d bought for Nicole’s ex-husband’s mother. The woman promptly sued him.Eventually, he paid her $25,000 to leave, even though — thanks to his kindness — she’d lived for several years at the flat for free.          Dudley Moore pictured with Peter Cook in Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles in 1978. Though he had feared a diagnosis of a degenerative brain disease, known as PSP, for Dudley it was almost a reliefWith hindsight it was obvious that some of the early signs had been his trouble with remembering lines on Streisand’s film set.In October 1999, I visited Dudley in New Jersey, where he’d been living with Rena’s family — who helped care for him — for two years. The house next door had come up for sale and he’d immediately snapped it up. Rena’s daughter had just moved in to help him and he’d also hired a cookhousekeeper.The next few days were heart-wrenching as I saw the full devastation of Dudley’s illness. His speech had become slurred and his balance unsteady he would often stumble while walking or climbing stairs, and had a tendency to fall backwards.On top of that, his eyesight had become impaired. He was having trouble focusing and was suffering from double vision. Taking part in conversation had become difficult. Sometimes he’d begin expressing a thought but would lose the thread before he could get it all out.It was frustrating and enervating, and he found it easier to listen than to participate. ‘I’m trapped inside this body,’ he’d tell me. ‘It feels as if I have something on the tip of my tongue but I can’t quite get at it. I start to say something, but by the time I’ve said it, the rest of the thought has disappeared.’I noticed he had three grand pianos in the house as well as the upright he’d learned on as a child — but he played only when no one was around.He felt tremendous gratitude towards Rena and her husband Brian. ‘They are remarkable,’ he told me. ‘They’re like the family I’ve never had. I feel very comfortable here. Life is very quiet, nice and extremely supportive.’Later, as Rena drove us home from lunch at a restaurant — a daily ritual — Dudley played his Songs Without Words CD. His eyes filled with tears as we listened to his evocative score from the film Six Weeks, arguably his most outstanding composition.These days, he spent a great deal of time playing his own music, he said. Now that he could no longer play properly, listening had become his substitute.He even watched his own movies, laughing at himself. It was the first time in his life that he’d felt able to sit back and genuinely appreciate his work.‘I don’t visualise myself at concerts, and I’m not obsessed by images of myself at the piano,’ he said. ‘You get used to the idea of saying: “Goodbye, goodbye, practical world…”‘But there are regrets. It’s very hurtful to realise that one can’t function in the same way ever again. So I just listen to my old records and feel it’s something unachievable by today’s standards, but it was achievable in the past.’ Before leaving, I asked if he’d play for me one last time. To my delight, he launched into his exquisite Six Weeks score. No, it didn’t sound the same. But when he couldn’t sustain the classical sound, he suddenly transformed it into a moment of glorious improvised jazz.          Moore, right, with Peter Cook, left. Moore spent a great deal of time playing his own music, he said. Now that he could no longer play properly, listening had become his substituteKnowing that Bach and Ravel had written music specifically for the left hand, I asked him if he’d consider playing in public again.He shook his head. ‘It’s not my bag. It’s maddening as it’s the one thing that I really regret saying goodbye to — the ability to play with two hands — but it’s impossible to get the hands together to play the right speed.’At the end of my three-day stay, Dudley gave me a long, tight hug, his face puckered into that familiar boyish, pixie smile.In his own way, he continued to fight back against his illness. He compiled a CD with Rena of a legendary concert he’d performed in 1992 at the Royal Albert Hall.And with great courage, he agreed to give a charity performance in Philadelphia that November, in which he and Julie Andrews narrated American poet Ogden Nash’s Carnival Of The Animals.With the help of his speech therapist, Dudley worked assiduously on the narration for several weeks. He was ecstatic to be facing an audience again — and they responded on the night with a standing ovation.During his final few years, he was wrapped in the loving, protective cocoon provided by Rena’s family.Life settled into a routine filled with speech and physical therapy, daily excursions to local restaurants, rented movies every evening, holidays at the family’s Nova Scotia hideaway and even a week’s cruise to Bermuda.With them, Dudley was at last able to find the peace and contentment that had eluded him for so much of his life.In the autumn of 2001, despite his increasingly frail condition, he came to Britain to receive a CBE from Prince Charles, who spent several minutes speaking with him. Afterwards, he caught up with old friends, including his first wife Suzy Kendall.When he said goodbye to them all, he knew it was for the last time. At the end of March 2002, just a few weeks before his 67th birthday, Dudley lost the battle he’d so bravely fought for the past five years.Adapted from Dear Dudley: A Celebration Of The Much-loved Comedy Legend by Barbra Paskin, published by John Blake on November 15 at £18.99. © Barbra Paskin 2018. To order a copy for £15.19 (offer valid to 241118 p\u0026ampp free), visit www.mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640."},{"url":null,"title":"Amanda Knox reveals ENGAGED","story":"    Amanda Knox accepted her boyfriend Christopher Robinson\u0027s proposal .

Their home was always filled with music and laughter. Tessa would be devastated to know that it had caused such heartache.’When Tessa died in a nursing home in January 2011, the 98-year-old widow was childless and left her bungalow, filled with jazz records, film posters and celebrity photographs, to the nephew she regarded as the closest thing she had to a son.But this act of love, set out in a will the socialite made a couple of years before her death, marked the beginning of a legal nightmare which, until a judge stepped in this week, almost saw mild-mannered Martin deprived of his inheritance.          Martin remembers being so beguiled by Tessa\u0027s (pictured) beauty that ‘if she smiled at me, I was so overawed that I’d hide behind the sofa’After Tessa’s death, the home-made will was mislaid and so her estate was not formally admitted to probate, the legal process by which a person’s estate is dealt with after their death. Martin had no idea that this legal state of limbo placed him in a precarious position.Unfortunately, her empty £500,000 home caught the attention of heir hunter Andrew Fraser, who has appeared on the BBC series Heir Hunters, a programme documenting the work of those who devote their lives to tracing beneficiaries.In a move that will strike fear into the hearts of families across Britain, Fraser obtained legal control of Mrs Amstell’s estate after being employed by a local authority to track down beneficiaries, changed the locks at her house and, despite being told of the existence of a will, was just days from selling it at auction when he was stopped by an 11th-hour injunction.It was only this week, after a protracted legal battle, that a judge ordered Fraser to hand the keys to Mrs Amstell’s beloved home to her nephew and to foot a legal bill said to amount to around £130,000.‘For the past two years, it’s been like having a sewer rat sinking its teeth into my neck and not letting go,’ says Martin when we meet in a local hotel. ‘It’s been terribly stressful, but I knew I was in the right and I was determined not to give in.’In a tweed jacket, smart shirt and tie, Martin is charming and solicitous. But his passion is evident when he dwells on the consequences of the heir-hunting industry. ‘I felt so strongly about fighting this. If I hadn’t had the money to fight it, I would almost certainly have caved in.Murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi WAS ordered by Saudi...\u0027He\u0027s a Duchy Original!\u0027: Queen pays warm tribute to Charles...Share this article‘What really preys on my mind is that people like this get away with it most of the time.‘If this is what happens when you tell someone there is a will, and they choose not to mention it to the court, then it’s likely this is being done by other firms. Something needs to be done.’So how on earth did such a horrendous situation arise — especially given that Mrs Amstell not only signed a will, but had it witnessed by two people?Aside from the upset this case has caused, it shines a spotlight on concerns about how local authorities use heir-hunting firms to deal with empty properties and those who die without a will. Such arrangements offer huge profits to the heir hunters, who track down potential beneficiaries in return for a slice of the inheritance.          Heir hunter Andrew Fraser outside Central London County Court during hearing in dispute with Martin AmstellBut legal experts warn that the involvement of the unregulated probate research industry is leading to massive overcharging and estates being awarded to the wrong relatives.Mrs Amstell, however, not only made a will in February 2009, but when she put her signature to the two-sided single page she did so with such vigour that the ink from her fountain pen bled through the paper. The document, which was drawn up by another family member using a will-writing guide, was commended in court this week for being ‘a model of simplicity and clarity rarely seen these days’.Having moved into a nursing home several years earlier, she left the house, which she hoped would remain in the family, to Martin and the remainder of her estate — £130,000 in cash and assets — to 22 different animal charities.‘The first she mentioned leaving her home to me was two or three years before she died,’ Martin recalls. ‘She said, “I want you to have the bungalow.” The next time I saw her she said she was sorry for being a “soppy old sausage” but some time after that she spoke about drawing up the will.’          After Tessa’s death, Martin and his sister might have been expected to apply for probate so Tessa’s wishes could be carried out. But, he explains, with homes of their own, they were in no rush to actAlthough Martin wasn’t present when the will was signed, it was witnessed by his older sister Marion, who was named executor, and by one of Mrs Amstell’s oldest family friends. Photocopies were made and, along with the original, stored at Marion’s home.When Tessa died peacefully in January 2011, Martin, who is unmarried, his sister and her children were the only mourners at Bushey Jewish Cemetery, Hertfordshire, where she was laid to rest alongside her husband, who had died in December 2005.After Tessa’s death, he and his sister might have been expected to apply for probate so Tessa’s wishes could be carried out. But, he explains, with homes of their own, they were in no rush to act.The bungalow had already been empty for years because Tessa (born Toba Gembitsky in 1912) and Billy had moved into a nursing home together in the late Nineties, when they were both in their 80s.          Mrs Amstell\u0027s husband, jazz musician Barnet \u0027Billy\u0027 Amstell (pictured)The couple, who met at Pinewood Studios while working on the film Kicking The Moon Around and married in 1938, refused to sell the two-bedroom property and left it in the care of Martin’s sister.‘It was like a ghost house,’ says Martin. ‘It was exactly as they had left it with all their belongings.’As Tessa’s attorney, Marion had handled her aunt’s financial affairs for several years, arranging for money to be paid from Tessa’s bank account to cover nursing fees and paying gas and electricity bills. She made regular visits to the bungalow to sort the post.‘I wasn’t thinking about selling the bungalow even though I wasn’t going to live in it’, says Martin. ‘I didn’t know what I was going to do with it, but it never occurred to me that someone would try to take it from me.’ With the benefit of hindsight, he wishes they had acted sooner.There was an added complication because Marion, who is now 85, could not immediately lay her hands on the will. She had moved house between the drawing-up of the document and Tessa’s death, and couldn’t recall where she had placed it among the mountains of paperwork and boxes of books she and her family had accumulated. Not long after Tessa’s death, her own health deteriorated when she suffered a stroke.‘I didn’t want to put pressure on her,’ says Martin. ‘I didn’t see it as an urgent problem. Of course I regret it now. What has happened is a lesson in how not to do these things. I was incredibly naive.’Problems began when Tessa’s empty bungalow came to the attention of Brent Council, though it’s not known how. They contacted Andrew Fraser, of Fraser and Fraser, a London-based family firm of international probate researchers, in a bid to locate the property’s owner.          Fraser changed the locks on the north London home and stopped Mrs Amstell\u0027s nephew from claiming his aunt\u0027s houseThe company specialises ‘in tracing owners or their next-of-kin to properties that are vacant, occupied illegally or falling into disrepair’.Such services are usually provided free of charge to local authorities because the ‘leads’ can be highly lucrative.If it transpires that the owner is dead, and if a blood relative can be located, heir-hunting firms will offer to secure an unexpected inheritance for an inidual in return for a hefty percentage of it. The first the Amstells knew of Fraser and Fraser’s involvement was when Marion received a phone call from one of the company’s case workers in July 2016, asking if she knew of a will.‘She had no idea who was calling her,’ says Martin. ‘She was very suspicious. She told them that there was a valid will and that she was the executor, but that the will could not be immediately located.’A letter from the company followed saying that if no will was produced, there was a risk that Tessa’s estate would be regarded as ‘intestate’, or without a will.          Mr Amstell was forced to take his fight to the Royal Courts of Justice, where Fraser was ordered to pay back the costs By then Andrew Fraser had already tracked down one of Tessa’s distant relatives — an American-born man named in court as Keith Simpson — and agreed with him that Fraser and Fraser would receive a proportion of any amount of Tessa’s estate that they recovered for him.He went on to apply to the Winchester probate registry for a grant of letters of administration over Tessa’s estate on the basis of intestacy, swearing an affidavit without mentioning the will Marion had told him about. This gave him control of the house on behalf of the beneficiary.Judge Nigel Gerald said in court this week that Fraser was ‘materially misleading’. Taking control of Tessa’s property ‘with gusto’, he changed the locks and cleared the house of a lifetime of Tessa and Billy’s cherished possessions. Among them was the only known photograph of Martin’s Jewish grandparents, who fled persecution in Warsaw in 1898 and arrived in London unable to read or write, and speaking only Yiddish.          Martin Amstell pictured outside the Royal Courts of Justice in LondonFraser went so far as to put the bungalow up for sale at auction in February 2017 and, even when Martin and his sister had tracked down the will (tucked inside a cardboard box filled with other files), did not withdraw it from sale until threatened with an injunction.Fraser then embarked on a hugely expensive 12-month trawl through Tessa’s medical records in what was described in court as a ‘pointless’ attempt to prove she had not been of sound mind.‘In effect he cherry-picked her medical records, ignoring the parts that made it clear how sharp-minded she was,’ says Martin.Even when he dropped the challenge to the inheritance in 2017, and Martin was handed the grant of letters of administration, Fraser went to court in a bid to get him and the animal charities named in the will to pay the £134,000 costs he ran up while supposedly hunting for heirs.For this, Fraser came under especially heavy fire from the judge: ‘Mr Fraser treated this as a commercial venture,’ he said, adding that Fraser had ‘acted in a belligerent and provocative manner which appears to be intended to run up costs and bring pressure to bear on Mr Amstell to withdraw or settle the claim.‘There was a specific and deliberate intention to run this litigation as disproportionately, obstructively and expensively as possible.’Andrew Fraser told the Mail that he was ‘disappointed by the result’ of this week’s costs hearing and that Fraser and Fraser had not yet decided if they would appeal.A statement released by the company said: ‘The existence of a possible will, its content and the location of the will were fully disclosed and information was drip-fed to the blood family whom Fraser and Fraser had located.’It added: ‘In the six years between Mrs Amstell passing away and Mr Fraser obtaining a grant, nothing had happened apart from the will being lost. Indeed, none of the charities had received any money and bills for utilities and council tax concerning the property had not been paid.’Martin Amstell’s main concern is that the heir-hunting industry isn’t regulated.‘I’m not sure that the average person would be able to stand up to them,’ he says. ‘My sister is in a state of complete exhaustion and I am still reeling.’Now he has the keys to Tessa’s bungalow, Martin must decide what to do with it. He entered the property for the first time on Thursday and was devastated to find it stripped bare. After so much distress, he says he will now probably sell it.‘Tessa loved the bungalow,’ he says quietly, ‘but I think she’d understand that it’s time to let it go. My sister and I have been through enough.’"},{"url":null,"title":"RICHARD KAY reveals Prince Charless extraordinary 70th birthday","story":"    I came, I sawed, I conquered: How Edward and \u0027victim\u0027 Peter Phillips might have lookedHis partner who clambered willingly, if a little nervously, into a wooden box was Princess Anne’s son and Charles’s nephew Peter Phillips, whose 41st birthday was the following day.Many a royal heart was in mouth as the pair, with Edward brandishing a hand saw, stepped on to the stage for the highlight of a riotous and joyful celebration at Buckingham Palace.All the elements of the Prince of Wales’s life were there.

The Prime Minister (pictured in her Downing Street office) is determined to see her plan for Britain throughOnly after returning to the No 10 flat was she finally able to discuss her woes with her husband.Philip May, a banker, was so irked by the wall-to-wall reporting of his wife\u0027s imminent political demise, he has taken to switching off all TV news bulletins at work. When she returned from Clarence House, he was waiting in their Downing St kitchen with more modest fare than the champagne and fine canapes at the royal birthday party.\u0027We went up to the flat for a quick bite – Philip cooked beans on toast – I think I opened the tin! He made the toast – and did the washing up! Then it was downstairs for a quick meeting and home (their property in Sonning, Berkshire) by 9.30pm so I could get the washing on and leave it to dry overnight.\u0027          Theresa May (pictured during the exclusive Daily Mail interview) has told how her husband was her rock this week As ever, the middle-class vicar\u0027s daughter was putting day-to-day practicality first.She skipped her usual Friday morning gym session to be back at Downing St for our interview but says she could not survive the pressure cooker of politics without Philip. \u0027I always say he is my rock. It\u0027s hugely important to have somebody there who is supportive of you, not involved in the intricacies of politics, but there to provide human support.\u0027 When they met at Oxford, Philip was as politically ambitious as she was. \u0027He thinks what I am doing is important for the British people, though he doesn\u0027t put it like that. He says \u0027Keep going, this matters, keep doing the right thing\u0027.\u0027Mrs May says Philip feels the pain of the vicious personal attacks on her by Tory Party critics even more than she does. \u0027It\u0027s often harder for the other half because they are watching it and feel protective and think \u0027Why are they saying that to my wife?\u0027 He does feel some of it (the hurt) himself – he\u0027s bound to. We\u0027ve been married for 38 years, that\u0027s a long time.\u0027 Some Whitehall veterans have compared the air of impending doom now enveloping Mrs May\u0027s No 10 to the last days of Margaret Thatcher in 1990, when, just as with Mrs May, her Tory ministers were deserting her.Maggie\u0027s husband Denis has often been likened to Philip: discreet and monosyllabic in public similar in appearance – tall, slim, formal and above all loving and fiercely loyal.When the Tory sharks circled around Lady Thatcher, it was Denis who stepped in and said it was time to go, telling her: \u0027You\u0027ve done enough, old girl. You\u0027ve done your share. For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t go on any longer.\u0027 Has Philip reached that point? \u0027No, he supports what I\u0027m doing.\u0027He must feel like punching her Tory assailants on the nose?\u0027You\u0027ll have to ask him – he\u0027s as protective as any other half.\u0027Mrs May says her Christian faith has also helped. \u0027I am a practising member of the faith and go to church regularly. It is an important part of my life – part of who I am and how I do my job.\u0027She is careful not to attack Mr Johnson, Mr Rees-Mogg and others directly, perhaps because she is fearful of prodding the hornet\u0027s nest. But she leaves little doubt that she regards some hard Brexiteers as vainglorious, fanatical ideologues with no regard or knowledge of ordinary people or real life.\u0027Some politicians get so embroiled in the intricacies of their argument they forget it is not about this theory or that theory, or does it make me look good? It is what is best for people going about their lives day in and day out. They think too much about their privileged position and too little about their responsibility. The job of a prime minister is to make tough decisions which are not always black or white. I have to find a way through, what best suits everybody\u0027s needs.\u0027 Mrs May does not pretend her Brexit plan is perfect.\u0027It\u0027s not everybody\u0027s ideal deal. You were never going to get that.\u0027She is hardly extolling it to the skies – however hard she tries to get people enthused about it, there\u0027s a feeling she must know the truth: that it is the least worst option.But she is intensely frustrated that so few have given her credit for addressing the main reason millions voted to cut ties with Brussels: controlling immigration by ending freedom of movement.\u0027As Home Secretary for six years I did my best to reduce immigration with one hand tied behind my back because you couldn\u0027t do anything about people coming in from the EU,\u0027 she said. \u0027Now we can. Freedom of movement ends.\u0027She trotted out her other Brexit achievements: \u0027no more sending vast sums to the EU an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice out of the Common Agricultural Policy out of the Common Fisheries Policy out of the customs union out of the single market independent trade and an independent coastal state. That is delivered in the future.\u0027It sounds impressive. But she is back on the defensive when challenged over claims that the EU can now veto us leaving the customs union: \u0027No, no, no, no. In the future we WILL leave customs union.\u0027But we are trapped in it?\u0027No, no, no, no, no.\u0027 She\u0027s very much in Maggie mode here.Could Mrs May categorically say the EU would not have a veto?She pauses, \u0027You are talking about it, you see …\u0027Have they or haven\u0027t they?\u0027No, but…\u0027Won\u0027t they just trap us in it?\u0027No. The EU does not have a veto on us leaving the customs union – we have a future relationship where we are not in it.\u0027It sounds categorical.But then she adds the so-called \u0027backstop mechanism\u0027, involving \u0027UK-wide customs territory arrangements to ensure the Ireland and Northern Ireland border remains free\u0027, can only be ended by \u0027mutual consent – we don\u0027t have unilateral withdrawal from that.\u0027 No wonder people are confused.She also struggles to answer Esther McVey\u0027s withering comment to her after quitting the Cabinet: \u0027You have gone from saying no deal is better than a bad deal to any deal is better than no deal.\u0027\u0027No, I haven\u0027t gone to that position,\u0027 she says tersely.But what if her deal is voted down by MPs? She will have nowhere to go. It will be the end game. She refuses to contemplate it: \u0027I am focusing on making sure I persuade people this is a good deal.\u0027 Admirers will praise her resolve: cynics will say she is in denial. But in a message aimed at her Tory assassins she says replacing her as prime minister would not lead to a better Brexit offer. \u0027People say \u0027if you could only just do something slightly different, have a Norway model or a Canada model, this backstop issue would go away.\u0027 She turns up the volume: \u0027IT. WOULD. NOT. THAT ISSUE IS STILL GOING TO BE THERE.\u0027Whatever your view of her as a prime minister, there can surely be no doubting her fortitude on a human level. She makes light of the regular injections of insulin she requires ever since she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.She jokes that during last week\u0027s five-hour Cabinet Brexit summit \u0027I was the only one who didn\u0027t take a break! You get used to managing it. It becomes part of your way of life. I inject when I eat,\u0027 she said matter-of-factly.As for the idea that she is about to suffer the same fate as Lady Thatcher, who wept as she was driven out of Downing St, it simply isn\u0027t on her mind.\u0027I don\u0027t go \u0027Oh gosh, it must have been like this x years ago\u0027. I wake up each morning and say \u0027What have I got to do today to get where we need to be?\u0027.\u0027Being prime minister is about fighting the good fight for the country,\u0027 she insists with that air of defiance and resolution. And that is what I am determined to do.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/16/23/1B802AB2000005DC-6399529-image-a-28_1542409973630.jpg","title":"How King Lear turned Mad King George III madder given copy Shakespeares play","story":"    George III was given a copy of Shakespeare\u0027s King Lear as he struggled with mental illness – and it worsened his conditionFor a royal in the grip of madness, it was probably not the ideal reading material.George III was given a copy of Shakespeare\u0027s King Lear as he struggled with mental illness – and it worsened his condition, according to papers on his reign published yesterday.The play, which tells of Lear\u0027s gradual descent into madness, was blamed for a significant deterioration in the health of George, who was restrained in a straitjacket two days later when he became \u0027ungovernable\u0027.His doctor Sir Lucas Pepys wrote in a letter to the Prince of Wales: \u0027His Majesty was all yesterday evening in a good natured deranged state, talking as he used to do...\u0027This morning he is… more agitated and confused, perhaps from having been permitted to read King Lear.\u0027 The letter was written on December 18, 1788, when George was 50.

Amber Augusta Rudd was born in August 1963, the youngest of four children, and enjoyed a privileged upbringing in a large family home in Kensington, West London, and a country house in Wiltshire.Her father Tony was a successful self-made Labour-supporting stockbroker while her mother Ethne was a Tory-leaning magistrate. After Cheltenham Ladies’ College and Edinburgh University, she worked in recruitment and dabbled in the film industry, serving as the ‘aristocracy co-ordinator’ on Richard Curtis’s hit Four Weddings and a Funeral.In 1990 she married AA Gill, the writer and restaurant reviewer, and they had two children together. In an interview with the Mail recently, she described how she realised the marriage was over when she arrived to collect Gill from the airport and found him with his mistress Nicola Formby, a South African model. She orced him in 1995.  In 1990 she married AA Gill, the writer and restaurant reviewer, pictured together campaigning in the 2005 general election, and they had two children togetherRudd turned to politics in her forties, winning the marginal seat of Hastings and Rye at the 2010 general election. She backed Remain in the referendum. Her multi- millionaire younger brother Roland is one of the most influential PR men in the country and one of the key figures in the campaign for a People’s Vote.Despite Rudd’s rapid march up the ranks, her Commons seat remains on a knife edge. Her majority stands at just 346 and she is seeking advice from election guru Sir Lynton Crosby.In 2013 Rudd upset some poverty campaigners when she said: ‘You get people who are on benefits who prefer to be on benefits by the seaside. They’re not moving down here to get a job, they’re moving down here to have easier access to friends and drugs and drink.’ Many of her constituents welcomed her remarks but they may come back to haunt her.In her new position at the Department for Work and Pensions she faces the tricky task of pushing through the Government’s Universal Credit benefits reform in the face of fierce opposition from a Labour Party happy to leap on such remarks.If anybody can handle the pressure, though, it’s Rudd – a woman who can show even her boss a thing or two about resilience. "},{"url":null,"title":"Lady Kitty Spencers wealthy Italian ex woos Elizabeth Hurley date Mayfair","story":"    Niccolo Barattieri di San Pietro was spotted on a date with the Elizabeth Hurley, 53, in London’s Mayfair          Ex-lovers: Lady Kitty Spencer and Niccolo Barattieri di San Pietro in July 2016EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: Harry and Meghan \u0027may leave their...Decimated: New drone images show how fire utterly wrecked...Share this article  Daughter of Charles\u0027 ski tragedy pal to tie the knot Prince Charles, who gallantly agreed to walk Meghan Markle down the aisle at her wedding, can look forward to another poignant occasion.His goddaughter Alice Lindsay, whose father was killed on a skiing holiday in the Alps with the Prince, has become engaged.Art history teacher Alice, 30, is to wed lawyer James Poyner, 33, next summer.‘We plan to light a candle for my father in the church, and the band will be playing some of his favourite songs,’ she tells me.Charles desperately tried to rescue Major Hugh Lindsay, a former equerry to the Queen, when he was buried by an avalanche at Klosters in 1988.

The trees are native to West Africa, where it has long been an agricultural crop, but it ended up in Southeast Asia more than 100 years ago as an ornamental crop.It’s the world’s most widely used vegetable oil — 66 million tons is produced every year — and consumption is on the rise, with the oil appearing in all manner of products.It was first planted commercially in Malaysia in 1917, and Indonesia and Malaysia now account for 85 per cent of the global supply. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), 42 other countries also produce it.          The advert follows the story of Rang-tan, the baby orang-utan who has taken up residence in a girl’s bedroom after losing his homeIncredibly efficient, the plant produces more oil per land area than any equivalent vegetable oil crop, hence its rapid rise. Palm oil supplies 35 per cent of the world’s vegetable oil demands on just under ten per cent of the land allocated to oil crops.It’s versatile, odourless and colourless, and has a high melting point so it is semi-solid at room temperature, keeping spreads spreadable. The WWF says it’s also resistant to oxidation (giving products a longer shelf-life) and stable at high temperatures (giving fried products a crispy texture).This explains why it is estimated to feature in about half of all supermarket products.SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?PRODUCTION has expanded at a frightening rate. Oil palm plantations are already said to cover more than 27 million hectares of the Earth’s surface — an area the size of New Zealand — and production is expected to triple by 2050.The spread of palm oil has been blamed for major deforestation in some of the most erse habitats. Given that this is largely unfolding in Indonesia and Malaysia, that’s where Rang-tan comes in.Iceland ad: Why is Palm Oil so bad for the environment?The one Christmas TV advert everyone ought to watch: SIMON...Share this articleVast areas of rainforest — once home not just to orang-utans, but also to tigers, elephants and rhinos — have been cleared to make way for oil palms. Already endangered animals such as the Borneo pygmy elephant, Sumatran rhino and orang-utans have been put at risk. An estimated 25 orang-utans are killed every day, and Iceland’s advert is dedicated to them.People are losing their homes, too. And that’s not to mention the question marks surrounding working conditions, and any impact of forest loss on climate change.HOW ABOUT SUSTAINABLE OIL?In recent years there has been a drive towards more sustainable sourcing and production of palm oil. But campaign groups’ views on how realistic this is differ.The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil was formed in 2004 due to concerns about the impact of mass production. It is intended to set a global standard for palm oil production, with ‘stringent’ criteria for producers, and a certification process to signal to buyers that the products they buy contain palm oil from a sustainable source.In 2010, many of Britain’s most popular brands pledged that by 2020 they would no longer buy palm oil from any supplier involved in the destruction of forests.But Greenpeace says that while responsible production is possible and does happen, questions remain over how reliable the system is. It says its research shows a string of leading brands are still sourcing from suppliers involved in clearing the rainforests.As for switching to a different oil? The WWF says that to get the same amount of alternative oils, such as soybean or coconut oil, you would need between four and ten times more land. This would shift the problem to other parts of the world and further threaten habitats.WHAT SHOULD YOU LOOK FOR?Palm oil has many different guises. Here are some of the ingredient names the WWF says to look out for: Vegetable Oil, Vegetable Fat, Palm Kernel, Palm Kernel Oil, Palm Fruit Oil, Palmate, Palmitate, Palmolein, Glyceryl, Stearate, Stearic Acid, Elaeis Guineensis, Palmitic Acid, Palm Stearin, Palmitoyl Oxostearamide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-3, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Kernelate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Lauryl LactylateSulphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, Ethyl Palmitate, Octyl Palmitate, Palmityl Alcohol.   From soap to chocs, what to swapMost manufacturers insist they use sustainably sourced palm oil.          Some of the products that still use palm oil are chocolate, soap, shampoo and lipstick however most manufacturers insist they use sustainably sourced palm oilCHOCOLATEPalm oil can give chocolate its smooth, shiny appearance and prevents melting.This week Greenpeace said it had evidence that suppliers to Cadbury’s parent company Mondelez had destroyed 70,000 hectares of rainforest since 2016. Mondelez International insists it is ‘committed to eradicating deforestation in the palm oil supply and actively working with suppliers to ensure palm oil is fully traceable’.It added that 12 suppliers who did not meet company standards had been excluded.Product containing palm oil: Cadbury Dairy Milk buttons.. . .and one that doesn’t: Montezuma organic smooth milk chocolate giant buttons.ICE CREAMPalm oil helps make it smooth.Product containing palm oil: Tesco vanilla ice cream.. . .and one that doesn’t: Yeo Valley organic vanilla ice cream.BREADPalm oil is often used in baking as it is semi-solid, like butter.Product containing palm oil: Kingsmill 5050....and one that doesn’t: Essential Waitrose wholemeal medium sliced.BREAKFAST CEREALThe oil helps its crunch.Product containing palm oil: Jordans Country Crisp.. . .and one that doesn’t: Dorset Cereals oat granola.PEANUT BUTTERThe oil, which is also used in margarine, aids spreadability.Product containing palm oil: Asda smooth peanut butter.. . .and one that doesn’t: Meridian organic crunchy peanut butter.SHAMPOOOur hair’s natural oils are restored by palm oil.Product containing palm oil: Head \u0026amp Shoulders.. . .and one that doesn’t: PHB Ethical Beauty shampoo.ROAST POTATOESThe oil is often in frozen roasts.Product containing palm oil: Aunt Bessie’s homestyle roast potatoes.. . .and one that doesn’t: Waitrose roast potatoes in goose fat.SOAPThe moisturising oil removes dirt and oil from skin and hair.Product containing palm oil: Dove Beauty Cream Bar (Sodium Palm Kernelate).. . .and one that doesn’t: Lush Fresh Farmacy facial soap.WASHING LIQUIDRefined palm oil is used in many cleaning products.Product containing palm oil: Ariel original washing liquid (Sodium Palm Kernelate).. . .and one that doesn’t: Ecozone laundry liquid.CANDLESPalm oil’s high melting temperature makes it ideal for candles.Product containing palm oil: It features in Ikea candles.. . .and one that doesn’t: Bloomtown Botanicals candles.LIPSTICK AND LINERThe oil holds colour well, is hard to melt and is tasteless.Product containing palm oil: Maybelline Color Sensational Lip Liner.. . .and one that doesn’t: Neek.PET FOODPalm oil makes biscuits crispy.Product containing palm oil: Tesco Christmas pudding biscuits for dogs.. . .and one that doesn’t: Lily’s Kitchen Sun Shiny Day snack bar for dogs.VITAMINSChewy ones often use the oil.Product containing palm oil: Bassetts orange and cranberry multivitamins.. . .and one that doesn’t: Viridian High Five multivitamin. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/11/4C9587ED00000578-0-image-m-38_1527158546114.jpg","title":"Fans flee panic Lil Pump concert evacuated","story":"    A concert by Lil Pump (pictured on stage in Los Angeles) was evacuated in Nottingham last night when \u0027smoke bombs\u0027 were let off inside Rock City           Firefighters were pictured at the scene where four people were injured in chaotic scenes at the venue last night           Fans were pictured crowded around fire crews as paramedics and police descended on Rock City in Nottingham after a \u0027smoke bomb\u0027 went off inside the venueSome used their clothing to shield their mouths and noses in an attempt to block out the smoke.  The Florida performer - who worked with Kanye West on I Love It - was determined to finish his show - and performed to fans on top of his tour bus.Ariana Grande is pictured surrounded by family at vigil on...Ariana Grande tweets her love to fans on one-year...Share this articleFour people sustained minor injuries and police attended the venue at about 9.30pm last night as Nottinghamshire Police told The Sun the chaos was caused by \u0027smoke bombs\u0027.Fire crews and paramedics descended on the scene as people took to Twitter to express their alarm at the incident.

Belafonte gets the 2015 Cadillac Escalade Brown gets the two 2017 Subaru Outbacks and the two Range Rovers. They split the gym equipment from their former marital home, while Mel alone gets the studio equipment from the house.America\u0027s Got Talent star Mel also gets a Spice Girls video game console that\u0027s particularly precious to her - but she has to pay Belafonte $2,500 for it.The final judgment allowing Mel to keep joint custody of Madison with her ex, was issued after Mel submitted records to the court showing that she had undergone - and passed - several weeks of drug and alcohol testing.Judge Juhas mandated the tests after Brown\u0027s former friend and \u0027manny\u0027 Rusty Updegraff made a damning declaration claiming she was unfit to look after Madison or her sister Angel because her drinking was out of control, she used drugs and often brought home random men to satisfy her ferocious appetite for sex.Updegraff, 59 - who told DailyMail.com that Mel is \u0027the world\u0027s number one bad mother\u0027 - claimed she slept with dozens of men since orcing Belafonte, including her children\u0027s piano teacher, a driver, a hairdresser, a \u0027surfer kid\u0027 and a guy she picked up at SoHo House, who the kids nicknamed \u0027smelly feet\u0027.

She had asked for a pay audit on a number of previous occasions but the company had refused, she said.“The Co-op have been found wanting, and I want to see the organisation change as a result,” she told the . “Going through this process has also revealed to me that the law is fundamentally flawed and must change. But more fundamentally, we need societal change: people shouldn’t want to work for companies who treat their employees differently and are breaking the law.“This is a major victory for women, but my case proves that pay discrimination can happen to anyone.”Walker said she first raised questions about equal pay in 2015 after comparing her salary to other male executives who sat alongside her on the board. The tribunal heard that senior executives had also questioned Walker’s performance over the progress of a huge IT project called 1HR, but she argued she had brought in the “right people” to improve performance.Walker told the tribunal that the company went through a regrading exercise of all staff, and she told Richard Pennycook, then the chief executive, in 2016 that it was “not looking good” from an equal pay perspective. “I told him that I thought the Co-op had an equal pay problem, which not only exposed the business to legal claims but was inconsistent with the Co-op’s declared values,” she said.A spokesman for the Co-op said the tribunal had dismissed most of Walker’s claims and held that her dismissal was not discriminatory.“Whilst the tribunal upheld the unfair dismissal claim on procedural grounds, we are pleased it found the Co-op had substantial reasons for justifying the termination of Ms Walker’s employment.”The tribunal accepted that Walker was sacked as part of a proposed restructuring, but Walker said this never took place.The company said it was considering whether to appeal against the equal pay claim. “We maintain we did not pay Ms Walker unfairly and continue to believe we acted in the best interests of our Co-op and its members,” said the spokesman.Walker said that she had used her savings and remortgaged her house to fund her three-year legal battle, which she described as “a living hell”.“Everything about the system stops people claiming and protects companies and going through this is financially unrealistic for most people,” she said.Walker was supported by the Fawcett Society and the former BBC correspondent Carrie Gracie, who won her equal pay battle with the corporation and donated her pay settlement to the Equal Pay Advice Service to support other women looking to make claims.“I take my hat off to Sam Walker for having the courage to take on the Co-op, another supposedly values-led organisation, but it has been a savage ordeal that no woman should have to go through in 2018,” said Gracie. “Most of us live in a culture of pay secrecy, and there will be many more victims who have no idea they are being discriminated against.“I hope this sends a message to employers to do right by the women in their organisation and if problems do occur to put their hands up and apologise rather than fighting them until the last breath.”Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the high-profile case had played an important role in raising awareness about equal pay. “This case is hugely significant because it shows what is possible when women get the chance to challenge pay discrimination,” she said. “Very few women do most are completely shut out. Pay discrimination can happen anywhere and that’s why we have to support women on low incomes particularly.”Walker said she was now determined to help other women with equal pay disputes, and she will speak alongside Gracie at the Fawcett Society’s Know Our Worth conference on Saturday. “Anyone thinking about doing it, I will help them prepare before they even make their claim,” she said. “I think there is a massive and growing network of strong women who are demanding change – if you think you have a case, come on, bring it on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0fdac8e7c1661c8a92802ca1b3cf4709a6c309e/0_50_5202_3121/master/5202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9d914c3b359a9a52e402eb86d344ce1","title":"man sues british airways ba for sitting him next to fat passenger","story":"Civil engineer says other BA passenger encroached on his space, causing back injuriesA holidaymaker who is suing British Airways for £10,000 has told a court he was injured after being forced to squeeze into a seat next to an obese man who was “the size of Jonah Lomu”.Stephen Prosser, 51, claims he suffered personal injury and loss of earnings after being made to sit next to the large passenger during a 12-hour flight from Bangkok to Heathrow.On Friday, Pontypridd county court heard the self-employed civil engineer claim cabin crew ignored his complaints that he would be injured if forced to sit next to the “extremely large” passenger, who he described as being 6ft 4in (1.93 metres) and weighing approximately 22 stone (140kg).Prosser, who is 1.60 metres (5ft 3in), said: “He was that large that he had to force his buttocks between the arm rests of the seats.“He sat with his knees wedged against the seat in front and the rest of his body was overspilling into my seat by some inches.“I was immediately aware that this was going to be problematic for me and I could feel the weight of his pure bulk putting lateral pressure on my upper body. This forced me into a position of unnatural posture.“Due to the size of him when he placed his arm down at times it would rest on my armrest, and he would accidentally turn the volume of my audio up to an extremely loud volume each time.”He said he chose not to take issue with the passenger because he seemed “self-conscious”, but did complain to cabin crew, who allegedly told him there were no other seats available on the fully booked Boeing 777 and did not allow him to swap with someone else.Prosser, from Penygraig in Tonypandy, south Wales, said the incident in January 2016 left him with a continual back spasm and an injury causing his sacroiliac joint at the bottom of his spine to malfunction.He said being forced into an unnatural position during the long-haul flight also aggravated a 12-year-old spine injury caused by driving long distances for work.He said he had been unable to work overtime as a result of his back pain, and he was left lacking energy, which had affected his relationship with his partner and forced him to give up mountain biking.Timothy Salisbury, representing British Airways, said Prosser was “exaggerating” by comparing the other passenger to the late New Zealand rugby legend Jonah Lomu, who was 1.93 metres tall and weighed 120kg.Salisbury said: “You say the man reminded you of the late rugby player Jonah Lomu. Would you say that’s a colourful explanation? An exaggeration?”Prosser replied: “Not at all.”Salisbury said cabin crew on the flight described the passenger as “tall but not overweight so he had encroached on the other seat”.Chris McLindon, the customer service manager on board the flight, said in a witness statement Prosser did not seem to be in any discomfort and “at times he was asleep”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60a617f39511a6d8d4edf0eb5e236da801857358/1070_292_1416_850/master/1416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e34d2686ee41a859e580c7813c84c1bc","title":"owner of the scotsman and i newspapers enters administration","story":"Johnston Press, which also owns the Yorkshire Post, has debts of £220m and failed to find a buyerJohnston Press, the owner of the i, the Scotsman and Yorkshire Post, has gone into administration after being brought to its knees by debts of more than £200m.The publicly-listed newspaper publisher, which put itself up for sale last month in a last-ditch effort to save the business from going under, has gone into administration admitting that its shares are now worthless.Under the process, the group, which publishes more than 200 regional titles, will move into a newly incorporated company controlled by the bondholders who control its debt. The company was due to pay the bondholders about £220m in June next year.The company said that it had received offers for parts of its business – the owner of the Daily Mail had considered a bid for its crown jewel asset, the i – but “none of the offers received delivered sufficient value” to save the company.“There were offers for the whole group, as well as for some inidual titles,” said David King, Johnston’s chief executive. “Each approach was examined carefully. Yet none of these offers, or combinations of offers, would have raised enough money to repay the £220m debt that we are obliged to settle in June 2019, nor did they allow the defined benefit pension scheme to remain attached to the company.”King, who took over as chief executive after the surprise departure of Ashley Highfield after seven years in May, sent an email to the company’s 2,000-plus staff saying their jobs are safe – for now.“Our operations will continue uninterrupted and so it is important that you turn up for work as normal – your employment contract will be transferring to the new company and you will continue to be paid as normal,” said King, in an email to staff seen by the . “The newspapers and websites will continue to be published as usual. As I have stressed on several occasions, our business is profitable with good margins. Our debt has constrained us.”The bondholders have agreed to inject cash into the business to reduce its debt.“Despite our attempts to engage, none of our shareholders has made any proposal to Johnston Press regarding the restructuring or refinancing of the bonds generally or submitted bids,” said King.The company also said that 250 current and former Johnston Press staff are set to see the value of their pensions fall. Under the terms of the deal to shift the assets to a new company, Johnston Press’s defined benefit schemes will not transfer and will shift to the government’s Pension Protection Fund, resulting in lower payments.

The chain was forced to correct its accounts, leaving it nearly £10m in debt instead of having £28m in the bank, as had been reported previously.The brand’s parent company, Patisserie Holdings, suspended its chief financial officer, Chris Marsh, who was later arrested. The chief executive at the time, Paul May, resigned on Thursday.Johnson, as Patisserie Valerie’s executive chairman, will probably be questioned by fraud investigators. There is no suggestion that Johnson has done anything wrong.Johnson waived his £60,000 salary and pumped £20m in loans into the company as part of a rescue after the accounting errors were discovered.

The damaging environmental impact of global meat production has spurred interest in bugs – which can be bred in significant numbers without taking up large amounts of land, water or feed – as an alternative, sustainable food source.The packaging for the crunchy crickets, made by London-based Eat Grub, deploys the environmental argument in a bid to win over shoppers who might balk at bugs for lunch. The new product is trumpeted by its manufacturer as “more sustainable than pork scratchings … and more exciting than a crisp”.The Eat Grub bugs – acheta domesticus, or house crickets – are farmed in Europe and come in packets of about 50, at £1.50 per bag. If shoppers can get over the ick factor, they can consume the crickets as a snack or as a garnish for noodles, soups and salads.The global edible insect market is set to exceed $520m (£406m) by 2023, according to recent research. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says at least 2 billion people regularly consume insects, and the tiny creatures could also help meet the food needs of the world’s growing population.More than 1,000 insect species are eaten around the world but hardly feature in the diets of many rich nations. In the UK, crickets and other insects have so far been predominantly limited to quirky pop-ups or sales through online outlets, while they also feature on a few restaurant menus. The move by Sainsbury’s means this is the first time consumers will be able to buy insects from a supermarket.“Insect snacks should no longer be seen as a gimmick or something for a dare,” said Rachel Eyre, head of future brands at Sainsbury’s. “It’s clear that consumers are increasingly keen to explore this new sustainable protein source.”Insects are naturally very low in calories and suitable for gluten- and dairy-free diets, as well as being exceptionally high in protein. Gram for gram, dried crickets contain more protein than beef, chicken and pork – with 100g containing 68g of protein, compared with only 31g of protein in beef.The food group also tops the list when it comes to sustainability. Bugs emit considerably lower levels of greenhouse gases than most livestock and are more efficient in terms of the resources needed to farm them – crickets, for example, need 12 times less feed than cattle.“As the population increases, we urgently need to look at alternative protein sources to make the most of land available for food production,” the food policy manager at WWF UK, Duncan Williamson, said. “Insects are incredibly sustainable and can help to reduce our carbon footprint.”Other retailers are capitalising on the rise of insect food. The online grocer Ocado sells Eat Grub’s protein bars made of cricket powder, while the French supermarket group Carrefour has started selling bug-based products from the Jimini’s range in more than 300 of its branches in Spain. The products include spicy chilli buffalo worms and insect-based energy bars, pasta and granola.The UK department store Selfridges, which also sells some of Jimini’s products, will next February launch a pop-up “Bug Bar” selling a range of products including cricket flour while introducing shoppers to new recipes. The specialist food shops Fortnum \u0026amp Mason and Planet Organic also stock the Jimini’s range.Chefs report some success in encouraging their diners to tuck into creepy-crawlies. Archipelago restaurant in central London has cricket and locusts on its menu, bought in bulk frozen from a supplier on the Isle of Wight.Diners at Heston Blumenthal’s Michelin-starred Fat Duck restaurant can savour mealworms from the Netherlands in edible soil in a savoury “woodlands-themed” dish – part of its £325 tasting menu. “I’m fully behind the idea of eating insects, but this one still feels like a work in progress. For one, the cricket looks too much like a cricket – I can make out its thorax and abdomen and I’d rather I couldn’t. They taste of whatever they are flavoured with – bitter with a little spicy kick at the end – rather than the cricket itself, which is perhaps a mixed blessing. But\u0026nbspfor me the sticking point is the texture. Crisp on the outside, it quickly yields before popping in your mouth. All that aside, if I\u0026nbspdidn’t know this was a cricket I could well imagine taking a handful out of a bowl at a party without thinking twice. But since I do, I can’t really get\u0026nbsppast it.” Morwenna Ferrier“I often have a little protein snack to keep me going in the afternoon – nuts or seeds or something boring like that – and crickets felt like they could definitely liven up that arena. They were satisfyingly crispy with an overall nutty flavour. There was also some sweetness and a hefty hit of coriander seed, although I suspect they were flavourings that had been added rather than the cricket itself. Despite the horrified looks of my colleagues, I’d recommend them – they tasted different without being off-puttingly weird. They did look like animal droppings, however, which is even worse than looking like crickets.” Tim Jonze"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d51a4040173f4ab4fdf5ef73fff107f0a8c5413d/0_141_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9566155be38138ab5ab3392e8479f85b","title":"labour mp deal no deal eu brexit","story":"Parliament’s approach to the draft European Union withdrawal agreement can either reaffirm or undermine public trust. Observing the manoeuvring around it, I despair at the insincerity of some. The UK held a referendum in 2016 with huge participation and a subsequent general election at which Labour and the Conservatives promised to respect the outcome. My pledges in 2017 included: “When Britain leaves, I will work for a deal that works for Doncaster … I don’t support a second referendum. We need to bring people together, whether they voted Leave or Remain.”Labour voted to trigger article 50 – beginning our formal withdrawal. Labour backed a transition period – to enable detailed trade and security matters to be negotiated. Labour has not supported single-market membership. Labour recognised that free movement would end and supported a permanent customs union arrangement – allowing the UK to strike its own trade deals not membership of the existing EU customs union. I have backed all of these positions advanced by Labour’s frontbench. Some Labour colleagues have not, their intention throughout being to overturn the 2016 vote.A sad coalition of extremes is coalescing to stop any deal: hard Brexiters, for whom compromise with the hated EU must be thwarted fuelled by the knowledge that if no agreement commands a majority a no-deal Brexit becomes the default outcome and ardent remainers who warned of the dangers of a cliff-edge Brexit, now hoping to defeat a deal and force a crisis to secure a second referendum. Polar opposites are united: Boris Johnson and Tony Blair condemned the deal before reading a word of the 585 pages.In 2016 a Labour MP told the Evening Standard: “I really have no time for calls for a second referendum because I think it comes across as disrespectful to those who voted to leave.” He added in the same interview that Blair’s government had lost trust by underplaying the numbers who would come from the EU accession countries. “That one mistake ... may I think have been the biggest driver of why we left the European Union.” He was correct on both counts. Except the MP Chuka Umunna now campaigns to overturn the referendum result.Apparently, 250 “People’s Vote” volunteers hope to persuade my constituents they were wrong to vote Leave. In 2016 I would have welcomed even two dozen as I slogged the streets for remain, finding little love for the EU. Some MPs – Lisa Nandy, Gloria De Piero and Gareth Snell among them – show real empathy for small-town Britain. For many lifelong Labour voters, who happened to vote Leave voters told in so many ways that they are stupid or worse. My leave-voting Don Valley constituency is made up of more than 30 small towns, mining communities and villages: worlds away from our metropolitan and university cities. Six out of 10 Labour MPs represent seats such as mine.The most frequent comments from voters now are: “Caroline, why haven’t we left yet?” And “Can’t you work together to sort this out?” I have been honest with remain voters about honouring the 2016 result, and my general election pledges. Equally, I have insisted to leave voters that a deal is the best outcome for jobs. Jeremy Corbyn is right when he argues we must bring leave and remain voters together. That’s why I called on the government to adopt a cross-party approach and invite Labour into their negotiating team. The government can never please the Tory hardline European Research Group faction. It’s not too late for the government to reach out to Jeremy Corbyn on aspects of an agreement. I have no idea what is going to happen next. The Government is imploding. While chaos reigns, few are focusing on the details. MPs promote agendas that have little to do with the agreement. Debate remains polarised.But if parliament rejects Theresa May’s deal, I want assurances from my frontbench that we won’t become the accomplices of the hard Brexiters, leaving the UK crashing out on 29 March. On this crucial question, I have a right to know how we guarantee toavoid the worst of all outcomes.I too want a Labour government and if Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no-confidence motion I’d back it. Since the Fixed-term Parliament Act, not one motion of no confidence has been tabled in six years. Some Labour MPs pretend that defeating May’s deal will lead to an election. It won’t. They don’t even believe it, yet raise false expectations among Labour supporters. This moment calls for honesty, not posturing. If after all the bluster, confusion, and parliamentary procedures, the Commons reaches a stage where MPs are left with no more options on the table – just one agreement or leaving with no deal – I know where my duty lies. Not to help May, not to help the government, but to do what I believe is in the best interests of my constituents and the country.Parliament has endlessly debated Brexit. I wish Britain’s towns and coastal communities had received the attention in that time they deserved. The advance of working people has been due to Labour Governments, not the EU. Labour introduced paid holidays and a minimum wage in the UK not Brussels. Labour must develop a post-Brexit agenda with a vision for their future, not a repeat of the referendum.• Caroline Flint is the Labour MP for Don Valley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3b9756460393039624f6d942c85d694b513f935/0_33_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6012dabb3708d041dcf860528eedef9d","title":"schools right ban pupils wearing designer coats","story":"A headteacher in Merseyside has ruled that jackets by the likes of Canada Goose, Moncler or Pyrenex are off limits. Is she interfering unnecessarily or maintaining a valuable principle?Just when I thought my trust in authority had hit the skids and would never be restored, a story popped up to remind me: I love headteachers. Woodchurch high school in Birkenhead has banned its pupils from wearing designer coats – the named brands are Canada Goose, Moncler and Pyrenex. It is not because kids are stupid, lose things or steal off each other (or that a big-ticket item more or less guarantees the worst possible result: mothers fighting in playgrounds). Rather, it is because of inequality. If some kids are walking around in £1,000 coats, those who cannot afford to “feel stigmatised, they feel left out, they feel inadequate”, says the school’s headteacher, Rebekah Phillips.The idea that teachers are all inveterate lefties is a lingering niggle in the culture wars when Michael Gove labelled the entire profession and all its acolytes “the blob”, his lack of regard didn’t come from nowhere. Education is widely perceived as a hotbed of anti-establishment political radicalism, starting at teacher training college, ending in the inculcation of dangerous socialism into unformed minds. While on the one hand, this is ridiculous – most teachers wouldn’t attend the revolution because they have marking to do – there is an eye of truth to it.A huge amount of schooling, especially in the early years, is about principles: sharing respect cooperation treating others as you would like to be treated yourself. The countervailing values of the market – survival of the fittest every man for himself commerce is king if you’ve got it, flaunt it – might stalk unchallenged across life’s other spheres, but they never fit very easily into the school environment. And so, inevitably, the rules can come across as a little bit, you know, socialist.It has been going on in schools since for ever. At the turn of the century, it was trainers: harsh hierarchies would come into place, where you knew you were a kingpin because that was £49.99 you were walking about in. The kid in the two-quid plimsolls would be shunned almost by reflex. Loads of schools still insist on unbranded trainers. If Canada Goose coats are a new arrival on the list, it is a reflection of their new ubiquity. Things only become a stigma risk when everyone wants them.The depressing end note is just how many of society’s problems schools are now having to solve: kids who can’t afford breakfast, or socks kids in temporary accommodation and going hungry in the holidays a fresh wave of misogyny arrived from nowhere and now, the overarching social truth that inequality is catastrophic to wellbeing. It’s like trying to do a regular job, and the job of Hercules, simultaneously. I don’t know how the blob does it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d8acff5ab5efc35e007298a7d74515d537ffaa7/0_0_2956_1774/master/2956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaedc89ad142f922124c4c3d81cf7c5b","title":"the guardian view on the tories and brexit the fantasy is finished","story":"Midway through Theresa May’s three-hour Commons grilling by MPs over her Brexit deal on Thursday, the former cabinet minister Stephen Crabb asked a rare sympathetic question about the “cold reality of hard choices and compromise” that now face the government. Mrs May’s reply was frank and even, in its way, eloquent. “The challenge for all of us in this house,” she said, “is to make those choices not according to what we wish the world could be like but according to the reality of the world that we see, and to make those choices pragmatically and in the interests of the British people.”The history of Brexit is the history of a refusal to face the truths Mrs May expressed in those words. She herself has not always faced them either. That was especially true in her early months as prime minister, when she recklessly embraced a cherry-picking hard Brexit that ided the public, was never going to be negotiable with the EU and would damage the country economically, socially and politically. Gradually, however, and especially since she lost her majority in 2017, Mrs May has found herself compelled to soften, and to make the choices and compromises that now make up the humiliating mongrel deal agreed by officials this week.The Tory party’s rightwing nationalist Brexiters never accepted this approach, and they never will. For them, Brexit is about parading their infatuation with a phoney ideal, not with the art of the possible. They have never, ever, had a practical proposal to make. Faced with realities, they resign and walk away. Like the grumpy giants Pope and Pagan in The Pilgrim’s Progress, they then scowl in their cave, denouncing others for betraying these wrongheaded and unachievable goals.Their attempt to unseat Mrs May is entirely of a piece. It is nothing more than the politics of petulance, and it is out of touch with a public mood of anxiety about the Brexit process and no small measure of grudging admiration for Mrs May’s doggedness, which has been reflected in editorial shifts at the Daily Mail and the . Even if the Brexiters succeeded in installing a true believer in Mrs May’s place, this successor would be the shortest serving prime minister in British history. The parliamentary numbers would remain unchanged. The Brexiter leader would put forward a fantasy plan that would be voted down. Michael Gove was more sensible by deciding to stay on.Even now, however, Mrs May’s embrace of Brexit realities is inconsistent. On Wednesday she emerged into Downing Street to say there were only three options available for Britain. The first was to accept her deal with the EU. The second was to reject her deal and crash out of the EU without a deal, while the third was to abandon Brexit altogether. This statement rightly caused excitement among pro-Europeans because it appeared to acknowledge growing public support for a second referendum and the possibility of a vote to remain in the EU after all.But the statement also masked the reality that other options may still be in play too. Mr Gove and the other surviving leavers believe they can reopen some issues in the May deal, for instance, notably on the backstop. MPs on both sides of the Commons who want Britain to retain membership of the EU single market for the post-Brexit transition are backing a so-called “Norway for now” option, though they have very different views of where it might eventually lead. Both Mr Gove and the new work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, are in this group. It is possible, therefore, that Mrs May is herself guilty of magical thinking about the political options.If Mrs May succeeds in her immediate task of holding on as Tory leader over the coming days and weeks, the stage is set for a major parliamentary showdown in early December. In those debates, the future of Britain will be at stake. Politics must rise to the occasion. Mrs May will deploy every weapon to get a Commons majority for her deal. MPs must be prepared to show equal determination in resisting it.If ever there was a moment when MPs should have a free vote and when they should be unflinchingly true to their consciences, this will be it. Parliamentary procedure will be crucial. It is essential, as the Commons procedure committee proposed this week, that there is enough time for debate, essential that all propositions are voted on, and essential that tricks are not used to force issues off the agenda. Right now, Mrs May does not have a majority for her Brexit package in parliament or the country. All options, including a second referendum, are inescapably on the table. The task of rescuing Britain from the Brexiters’ delusions has barely started yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff6709ae30cd37a20fa3061af7ca00057da044e/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=539eb5f607f82f81b4cc703c15e4b95f 1290w","title":"i couldnt go to the jobcentre i didnt have a cv building my business as a refugee","story":"When Moh Agha fled the war in Syria and arrived in the UK, he started selling books on ebay to support his family. Now he stocks more than 3,500 items and runs training courses for other refugees. This is how he got back in businessMoh Agha had a lot to take in when he first arrived in the UK with his young family in November 2013. “It’s not easy moving to a new country with a wife and two small children,” he says. “Everything was unfamiliar. We had no friends or family, it was very cold and people spoke very fast and with a strong accent.”After fleeing Syria for Saudi Arabia, the family arrived in the UK. “We moved from London to Bristol, then settled in Wolverhampton,” he says. “It wasn’t easy for me to go to the jobcentre, because I didn’t have a CV I’d always owned my own business. I wanted to open a shop, but it was very expensive because of council tax and business rates. I also found it hard to leave my wife Ranim and my daughters Yara and Amal (now 11 and six) at home alone, because they didn’t speak English. So when I discovered ebay and selling things from home, I realised it could be the solution.”Around this time, by chance, Agha attended a very British institution: the car boot sale. “I met a lady who was trying to sell old books – she had maybe 700 or 800 of them,” he recalls. “She didn’t want to take them home at the end of the day so she was giving them away for free. I took them back to my garage, sorted them out and listed 20 for sale on ebay. The next day all of the books were sold. I then listed the rest and spent the next six months looking around for more. The profit was small, but I was happy to be building a store and getting good feedback.”As Agha and his family began to build up a network of fellow Syrians between Manchester, London and Bristol, he realised that many in his community were struggling to find traditional items they missed from home. “I went to a big wholesaler in London and bought some Syrian kitchenware and house decorations and listed them,” he says. “I made a profit straight away and I realised that there was a real demand there, so I started to import more items from Egypt and Lebanon.”But building up an online store from scratch wasn’t without its challenges. “I’d watch videos explaining how to sell on ebay, but I couldn’t always understand them because they were in English or out of date,” he says. “I realised many people in my community needed these items, but didn’t know about ebay or were not sure how to use it. So I started making videos in Arabic, advertising my items and explaining how to make an ebay account and use PayPal.”Agha’s store, Almaskiya, now stocks 3,500 different items – from prayer mats to copper falafel makers – and he’s not just selling to the Syrian community anymore. “There’s a mould to make sweets that we use every Eid,” he says. “I made a 20-second video explaining how to use it, and now people from Europe are buying it at Christmas and Easter. We have orders for it every day now, actually. And there’s a metal straw that we use to drink tea in the Middle East. The idea came to me that people who drink coffee might want to use it to keep their teeth white. That’s become one of our bestsellers.”The business is growing – “we make a good profit in high season and we cover our costs the rest of the time” – but Agha hasn’t stopped there. “After I made the videos explaining ebay, a lot of people asked me how they could start selling too,” he says. Agha now runs free workshops around the UK for people interested in becoming ebay sellers. “Even though I know these people could become my competitors, I believe that everyone has their own strategy and their own way of doing things – and there’s room for millions of sellers. When I hear people thank me or say: ‘I’m going to pray for you’, or I see them start businesses with a good turnover, I feel proud,” he says. “It’s the best part of my day.” Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

And why should we care? Author of The Multi-Hyphen Method, Emma Gannon, explainsAlex Haddow, a comedian and picture editor, agrees: “I feel that by doing lots of things that pique my interest all the time, I get the most out of everything,” she says. “And because that keeps my interest up, I put more into them and get better results.”At the same time, the internet has given us access to a myriad of free tools and a huge global audience of potential customers and clients, whether using e-commerce hubs such as ebay, or building a following via social media – making many business ideas more viable than before. Not only is it easier to take that first step, but it’s reassuringly non-scary. After all, there’s no risking it all to follow your dreams it is, by definition, a bit on the side. Unsurprisingly, the rise of the multitasking worker comes hand-in-hand with fewer people working in a traditional “job-for-life” role. According to HR organisation the CIPD, around a quarter of workers have been in a job for less than two years, as working on a project-by-project basis lessens the stigma around job-hopping (and creates more impressive-looking CVs).Simultaneously, advances in technology have led to general job security being called into question. I started my side hustle in 2010, when I began to suspect that my magazine job wasn’t going to be around in five years’ time, and have been earning money with a blog and consultancy business ever since. This means we’re quicker to move on and less likely to look back. “I resent the job-for-life notion,” says journalist and volunteer Georgie Bradley. “The idea of clocking in, chaining myself to the desk, then clocking out nine hours later seems soul-destroying.”Researching my book on multi-faceted careers, The Multi-Hyphen Method, I met many more people making side hustling an art. Janet Oganah is a prime example: a former family law barrister, she is now a civil servant and podcaster. “Choosing a multi-hyphenate lifestyle was not an easy decision,” she says. “But it was one of the best ones I have made. I was invested in my legal career I did important work that changed lives. But I was uneasy about relying on one income stream, particularly with the cuts to publicly funded work.” Oganah turned to podcasting as a lucrative, creative way of ersifying her career. For Sally Steel, a teacher who launched a crochet business on ebay, the flexibility was vital for family life: “I wanted to work more creatively and be able to do the school run. I started teaching part-time, building my business while my twins were asleep or at nursery,” she says. “It meant I could spend more time with my children while earning a living. And the happiness I feel at being my own creative boss is worth all the hard work.” This fulfilment is a key factor. For Emma Glass, a paediatric clinical research nurse and author, it’s achieved through the variety of her days. “I feel lucky to have opportunities in both nursing and writing,” she says. “I like working in a clinical environment and with patients, and then spending the evening with publishers and writers and having entirely different experiences within a single day.” Of course, nobody wants to have 17 jobs to make ends meet, and it would be irresponsible to glorify that, but embracing multiple skills to create a modern portfolio career is exciting. We’re told to pick one thing to be good at from our school days, but we all have so many skills and interests. Being a multi-hyphenate answers this, expanding our earning potential and giving us the flexibility to choose how and when we work. After all, says Sarah Kingston, writer, consultant and owner of a marketing agency: “I get to be creative, challenged and excited about what I do. Why have one job title when I can have three?”Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Entrepreneurial experts share their hard-learned lessons, from the genuinely useful to what to avoidDon’t get lost in the crowdYou may think your product is better than everything else, but without something distinctive about it, it’s not going to stand out. “When I do consultancy work occasionally and, say, someone’s made a new T-shirt, I’ll say: ‘What’s so good about it?’” says Kuldip Singh Sahota, founder and chief executive of Mr Singh’s chilli sauces and crisps. “They’ll say, the fabric or design, but that’s what everyone says. What’s going to make you stand out? That’s where your brand and authenticity comes in, especially in such a crowded market.”Dave Bailey, a business coach and entrepreneur, agrees: “When you’re starting a new business, you have to get people to believe what you believe. And they’re never going to believe someone they think is fake or doing it for the wrong reasons.”Do have a good storyIt’s the entrepreneur who can spin a good yarn who gains a head start. For Sahota, that was the chilli sauce recipe his father Hardev “Pops” Singh Sahota had perfected over decades in the family’s shed in east London. They now sell sauces globally.“Everyone loves a good story, don’t they,” says Sahota. “It’s something customers can relate to but also, in our case, it helped us stand out with retailers who we wanted to stock our products.” To highlight the backstory, Sahota cast his father in a series of online comedy music videos to promote the brand.Don’t think all advice is good adviceIf launching a business or a product is like having a baby, entrepreneurs face a similar barrage of well-meaning, often contradictory advice from family, friends and a million business books. “Sarah Wood, the co-founder of the video ad tech company Unruly, once said the best piece of advice she ever got was that advice itself was overrated,” says startups’s Shane Donnelly.Sahota hates the kind of motivational self-help quotes that flood Instagram – “An investment in yourself pays the best interest” and all that sort of thing. “It starts off really well intentioned but it can really get on top of you after a while, so I ignore it all now,” he says.Do ask for experience not advice“A lot of advice is regret in disguise,” Bailey says. “Everyone’s got an experience, but rather than ask for advice, I often recommend asking for that experience.” In other words, not so much “what would you do?” but “what did you do?” – then make your own decision.“The worst advice I got was when I called this big wholesaler in east London and he said: ‘My biggest piece of advice for you is just quit, this is really hard’”, Sahota recalls. “And then he goes: ‘I’ll take a pallet off you if you want.’ And I remember thinking: ‘You told me to quit but you also want a pallet of my sauces? I’ll show you.’”Don’t stick with a product beyond its sell by dateBuilding a product around yourself only enhances your emotional attachment to your baby, but attachment parenting can be bad when things get tricky. “Where people come unstuck is they fall in love with their first creation and stay with it even when the evidence is against it,” says Bailey.“Holding a sentimental attachment to elements that just aren’t working will do your startup no long-term favours,” Donnelly adds.Do go back to the beginningIf sales or interest in your product aren’t what you had hoped, Bailey suggests going back to page one of your story. “Remember what it was that first motivated you,” he says. “What problem were you trying to solve? You have to be open to trying 10 or 20 different solutions and seeing what works.”For Sahota, the first element was working – his sauces were popular and central to his story – but to satisfy investors and progress as a business, he knew the answer was to make his crisps work. “And we should have made that move a lot sooner,” he says. “But I felt like I couldn’t look beyond the sauces unless I was dead.”Don’t look like an amateurIt doesn’t matter how good your story is if you come up short when talk turns serious. “You’ve got to have that nice soft exterior to connect but when you sit down with the supermarket or an investor, they have to know you mean business,” says Sahota. “You need to be able to say: ‘When you put my product on your shelves, I’ll drive customers in to your store because I’ve got followers who want it and I will add value to the category.’ That is hugely important for retailers.”Do ask the right questionsCustomer research is vital for any new business. “But people always ask their customers: ‘Would you use this product that does this cool thing,’” says Bailey. “But that’s a leading question. They’ll say: ‘Yes’ – and that looks like validation. But you should be asking about experience and behaviour.”Knowing how someone lives will help you to see how your product fits into people’s lives.To do this, Bailey suggests directing people to a landing page on your website and setting up a waiting list long before you launch anything, and then having a conversation with those people on the waiting list. “Even if you just get 10 people, that also means they feel the problem you’re trying to solve. And if nobody signs up, that tells you something, too.”Don’t fall into bad habitsKnowing how to structure each day – and what to do – can be tough for a solo starter, particularly one who has come out of an office environment. “You need to create really good habits straight away,” Sahota says. “There’ll be days when it’s really hard and those habits will get you through even if you’ve run out of willpower or motivation.” The sauce entrepreneur sets himself daily goals. “It could be something really simple like sending one really good email to a potential lead and following it with a phone call. On some days it’s good to set your goals low so you feel like you’ve achieved something.”Do take care of number one“Basically, get enough sleep and you’re halfway there,” Bailey says. “I used to work for a big consultancy, working all hours and travelling, and I hated the lifestyle. When I started my first business I was like: ‘I’m going to take my work-life balance seriously.’ Nonetheless, two years later, an investor turns to me during a crisis and says: ‘Dave, here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going to take a holiday for a week and come back to this fresh.’ It was what I needed.”Now you’re well versed in the major dos and don’ts, it’s time to get down to business.

A total of 37 tremors have been recorded since fracking began on 15 October, but none since 4 November.Locals have also said the company has told them no fracking took place last week. Julie Brickles, a local borough councillor, said: “Cuadrilla did confirm at the community liaison group this Monday that they hadn’t fracked for a week. They said they’d looked into the seismic data. It was very positive and they would start fracking again within days.”Campaigners who have kept up protests outside Preston New Road, in a farmer’s field halfway between Blackpool and Preston, said the site has resembled a “ghost town” for the past two weeks.They say there has been no sound of the five pumps used by Schlumberger, the oil services firm carrying out the fracking for Cuadrilla, which were heard in October.The company would not confirm whether it was fracking, saying only it was continuing to test the well.“We have been fracturing along the full length of the horizontal well using smaller volumes of water to test the micro-seismic response of the rock,” a spokesperson said.Fracking is usually understood to involve high volumes of water to fracture shale rock and release gas trapped inside.Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that are often deep underground. It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface.The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled.Francis Egan, Cuadrilla’s chief executive, previously told the  that because of concerns over seismicity the company planned to frack about one stage a day. He said that would take around two and a half months, as the company was only able to frack during the day between Monday and Friday and only in the morning on Saturdays.A fortnight’s hiatus would call that schedule into doubt and raises questions about the costs being incurred by the company, which has said each day of inactivity on the site costs it £94,000.Rose Dickinson, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “This isn’t the fracking fanfare Cuadrilla were hoping for. Instead, the industry seems to be stuttering into insignificance.”The firm has called on the government to relax its “traffic light system” regulations that require companies to stop operations if a 0-5-magnitude tremor is registered. However, ministers have rejected that idea.Natascha Engel, the government’s shale gas commissioner, wrote to the media this week to criticise “alarming” coverage of the minor earthquakes near Blackpool.“By reporting fracking events that cause tremors of 1.1 as earthquakes but not reporting similar or greater events in other industries, the media is in danger of reinforcing a narrative of fear around fracking,” the former Labour MP said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b8cd9807083cf2b13fe30a30fde7b2dee873fd7/0_41_5437_3262/master/5437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e82beb4b5496cd16963233d7045d36f","title":"the empire of the eagle book mike unwin david tiplin","story":"The Empire of the Eagle: An Illustrated Natural History, by Mike Unwin and David Tipling, is published by Yale University Press and celebrates the world’s 68 eagle species in all their magnificence and beguiling ersity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/312db42442d9642cb514f0e3c566f01270d34af7/0_0_4397_3064/master/4397.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=707dd8d321da337972cc2a3cffba07bb 1760w","title":"the best party outfits for all ages in pictures","story":"How to hit the festive circuit with style• ‘It’s a marathon, not a sprint’: top tips for doing the gruelling seasonal circuit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf53737e96cdc578bf0aa181c2d467c29937ffc4/0_210_5016_3010/master/5016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fdbc1c99e3acf6b3fa855ae71f657a3","title":"prosecco wine cava cremant fiona beckett","story":"It’s the sparkling wine alternative that won’t break the bankI don’t know if anyone else finds Christmas interminable, but assuming you’re not as big a grouch as I am, chances are you’ll be having – or at least planning – a party over the next few weeks.

Goals from Georginio Wijnaldum and Memphis Depay crowned a dominant display from the Dutch in Rotterdam which in turn ended the world champions’ 15-game unbeaten run.Friday’s result leaves Joachim Löw’s winless Germany rooted to the bottom of the table and heading to League B. And the Netherlands will have the chance to qualify for the finals of the competition ahead of France when they complete the group stage against the Germans in Gelsenkirchen on Monday. Victory would see Ronald Koeman’s men top the group, while a draw would also be sufficient because of their superior goal difference.The Dutch fully merited their victory at De Kuip and below-par France, without the injured Paul Pogba, would have lost by more had it not been for the display of their goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. Wijnaldum opened the scoring in the 44th minute, before Depay dinked in a penalty deep into added time.The Netherlands, who failed to qualify for the last two major tournaments, have been rejuvenated under Koeman and full of confidence from last month’s 3-0 success against Germany, they had an excellent opportunity to go ahead inside two minutes. Depay burst past France left-back Lucas Digne on the right before cutting the ball back for the unmarked Wijnaldum to strike a powerful first-time shot which was beaten away by Lloris.League A, Group 1: Germany v NetherlandsB1: Czech Republic v SlovakiaB4: Denmark v Republic of IrelandC3: Cyprus v Norway, Bulgaria v SloveniaD1: Georgia v Kazakhstan (5pm), Andorra v Latvia (5pm)D4: FYR Macedonia v Gibraltar, Liechtenstein v ArmeniaThe hosts controlled the opening period, although France threatened during a rare foray forward when Antoine Griezmann’s header from a Digne cross bounced off the surface before being held by Jasper Cillessen.Les Bleus, who needed a point to ensure top spot in the group, seemed content to sit back and they were grateful for Depay’s 13th-minute volley was straight at Lloris.The Dutch deservedly edged ahead a minute before half-time following a mistake by Steven N’Zonzi. The midfielder inadvertently helped Frenkie de Jong’s cross on to Ryan Babel and, after his close-range effort was repelled by the legs of Lloris, Wijnaldum reacted quickest to the rebound.France produced little response to going behind and could have been reduced to 10 men when Everton defender Digne was booked for a late, studs-up challenge on Denzel Dumfries. The PSV Eindhoven right-back was then twice denied by Lloris following Daley Blind’s cross as the hosts went in search of a second.The Dutch, led by Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk, defended resolutely and never looked like surrendering their lead as they beat France for the first time since Euro 2008. They eventually made the points safe in the fifth minute of added time when Depay cheekily chipped in from the spot after France substitute Moussa Sissoko brought down De Jong in the box.Ukraine, who have already secured top spot in Group B1, suffered a 4-1 defeat in Slovakia.Albert Rusnak, Juraj Kucka, Adam Zrelak and Robert Mak boosted Slovakia’s hopes of avoiding relegation, with Yevhen Konoplyanka’s strike merely a consolation for Ukraine.Norway and Bulgaria are locked on 10 points before the final Group C3 fixtures after respective 1-1 draws in Slovenia and Cyprus.Gibraltar took the lead against Armenia but eventually succumbed to a 6-2 loss in Group D4, where FYR Macedonia remain top after defeating Liechtenstein 2-0."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherOur notion of the traditional household is changing.

As you pass the shop’s windows, the eye is caught by items ranging from comfy sofas to chainsaws.Mike Webb, who runs the store with his two brothers, said: “Shopworkers and workers do what they do because they love it. That makes a difference. Everyone pulls together. When we did a litter pick and clean-up in the high street recently more than 150 people turned out. I think our regular customers and our visitors feel that this is a special place.”Crickhowell High Street, in an ancient town in the Brecon Beacons national park in Wales, was particularly jolly on Friday, having been crowned the overall winner in the government-run Great British High Street Awards 2018.At a time when many high streets up and down the UK are in the doldrums and struggling to survive, Crickhowell (Welsh name: Crug Hywel) is bucking the trend.Every shop is occupied and when plans to move a national supermarket into a disused pub on the high street were afoot, the town fought back. It argued that nine shops, among them two butchers, a baker and a florist, would be hit. The town won the day.“We are competitors but we work together,” said Raymond Grenfell, the owner of Grenfell’s \u0026amp Sons grocery store. He intended to stay just six months. That was 50 years ago.Emma Corfield-Walters, the owner of the Book-ish book shop, was given an inidual High Street Hero award for the role she has played in making the street so vibrant. “I put it down to people power,” she said.Cynics may claim the town’s high street is thriving because of its well-heeled residents.Corfield-Walters insists thatisn’t fair: “Like any town we have our social issues. And the shops haven’t come in on a wave of money. Some have been here for generations.”MT Cashell, the butcher’s, for example, has been in the town for 44 years. Josh Cashell, 22, was serving Black Mountain beef and Crickhowell lamb chops on Friday. He conceded it might be possible to buy meat cheaper elsewhere. “But the quality won’t be as good. You may get some things cheaper in a supermarket but it won’t be as good. Our meat comes from a few miles away.”Elsewhere in the UK, high street stores are being battered by a raft of threats, including a major change in shopping habits. Consumers are buying more online – about a quarter of fashion is now sold on the internet –and choosing to spend more on experiences such as leisure and holidays.Stores have also faced a big increase in business rates, higher labour costs as a result of a rise in the national living wage and a squeeze on spending power, with real wages still lower than before the financial crisis a decade ago. According to the British Retail Consortium, about 85,000 retail jobs have been lost this year.In Crickhowell, there is a determination to find new ways of thriving. After the supermarket plan was defeated, a limited company with 273 shareholders was set up to renovate three shops – among them a zero-waste shop called Natural Weigh – and three flats. The re-imagined Corn Exchange opened in July.Dean Christy, the managing director of the Corn Exchange Crickhowell, said he believed what had been achieved could be copied elsewhere. “It helps if there’s a threat like the supermarket plan and you need the opportunity. But more than anything you need passion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a053756d3d0434e9f70a9be730f97072e833b6ab/1015_984_2315_1389/master/2315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=207318e4a254535b6f1d72c912fe78a0","title":"experience i dropped two nuclear bombs","story":"The sky lit up 10,000ft above our eye level was a writhing molten mass. I was in aweI became aware of Operation Grapple in July 1956. There wasn’t a big Top Secret stamp on it. Everyone in the country had an idea that Britain was trying to become a nuclear power. I was a 22-year-old co-pilot in the RAF, just happy to be chosen for the mission.My main role was to monitor the flight instruments to make sure the captain was flying correctly. We practised dummy drops for months, flying Valiant bombers from Wittering airbase on the CambridgeshireNorthamptonshire border to a range over Orford Ness.After almost a year perfecting the drills with 1321 flight and, later, No 49 Squadron, we left for Christmas Island. Our drop proper came on 31 May 1957. The target was Malden, a tiny uninhabited island in the Pacific. After 50 minutes of flying we reached the rendezvous and the bomb aimer, one of five crew, went to lie down on a mattress in the well in the belly of the fuselage from that position, he looked straight ahead through the bomb sight at the aiming point. We then made a practice run – up to the release point, then a sharp turn to get away. When the order was given to proceed with the live run, we put metal shutters over all the windows in the cockpit so the violent light from the explosion wouldn’t affect our eyesight the bomb aimer had to keep his shutter open until the drop, though. I could only see through a small piece of welder’s glass in one of them. Despite being 45,000ft above the Pacific, we were in total darkness, the captain, Sqn Ldr David Roberts, and I flew purely by instruments.The bomb aimer took the safety latch off the weapon and said, “Steady, steady, steady”, to get us to hold our heading. As we crossed the release point, he pressed the button and announced, “Bomb’s gone.” We felt some elation, and the aircraft noticeably lifted as the 12,500lb bomb – codenamed Orange Herald – fell away. But almost immediately came the escape manoeuvre: Roberts rolled the aircraft into a steeply banked turn to get away from the upward rush of the exploding nuclear bomb. If we had carried on in a straight line, the fireball would have come up under the aircraft and that would have been it. The trouble was the accelerometer wasn’t showing any G-force at all. I told the captain “More G!” but as he pulled back on the stick we started to judder the aircraft was stalling. We had been turning, we just hadn’t felt the added G. We realised the accelerometer wasn’t working, and the overcorrection sent the bomb aimer – who was making for his seat – crashing back into the well.We knew that if we didn’t turn, we wouldn’t escape the explosion. Thankfully the captain regained control, the bomb aimer scrambled to his seat and, 53 seconds after the moment of release, the weapon exploded. Complete darkness turned to unfiltered daylight. It was as if there was no dark glass in the small aperture you could see the sky and the land below as clear as anything. Three minutes later, we felt a biggish bump as the shockwave hit the aircraft, then a smaller one a second later. We saw the sky lit up 10,000ft above our eye level was a writhing molten mass. I was in a state of awe. At 85, I’m one of three aircrew still alive from Operation Grapple, and to my knowledge I’m the only person to drop two nuclear bombs. For my second flight, the captain was Sqn Ldr Barney Millett, and instead of targeting an atoll like Malden, the drop on 8 November was just off Christmas Island itself. Same procedure, this time no faulty instruments, though this was a thermonuclear bomb – a hydrogen bomb yielding 1.8 megatonnes of TNT – more than twice the power of the previous one.We were checked with a Geiger counter when we got back: it wasn’t mentioned that we were in major danger, so no one was in a state of jitters. To date, I haven’t had medical issues resulting from Grapple, but I know that people on the ground who watched the explosions claim to have been affected. I think the services took the precautions they believed sufficient, but I don’t want to decry the people who say they have fallen ill.As for the ethics, my feeling was, it was a weapon of war. Whether it’s a 1,000lb bomb or a 10,000lb bomb, they’re not nice things to have, but they’re essential to defend our country. This was at the height of the cold war. The Soviet Union was a powerful nation we assumed it would use nuclear weapons if necessary, just as we would have done.• As told to Nick Thompson.Do you have an experience to share?

News organisations must never de-prioritise the vital skill of finding things out, getting to the facts, and reporting them clearly,” she said.At the same time, she said, the  had a responsibility to use its journalistic platform to develop ideas and not just critique what was going wrong in the world.“ will always embrace progressive policies and ideas, but in an age of filter bubbles and hyper-partisan politics, we must also make space for different ideas, and erse opinions,” she said. “Our guiding focus will be to challenge the economic assumptions of the past three decades, which have extended market values such as competition and self-interest far beyond their natural sphere and seized the public realm.” News and Media is aiming to break even this financial year after many years of losses and Viner said initiatives such as the relaunch of  Weekly as a glossy magazine were exceeding expectations, with its biggest group of new subscribers millennials.Viner also used her speech to pay tribute to her predecessor Alan Rusbridger as a fantastic editor who understood and embraced the digital revolution.

A spokesperson said: “Andrew acknowledges that the tweet was inappropriate, and it was removed shortly after it was posted. The tweet was sent from Andrew’s personal account, however the BBC has social media guidelines which it expects all staff to follow and these have been discussed with Andrew.”The tweets were sent at around 3.15am UK time, but Neil has said he was in the United Arab Emirates to present an awards ceremony. He is the longstanding chair of the Dubai-based publishing company ITP Media Group.Neil, a former Sunday Times editor, often uses his Twitter account to promote pieces published by the rightwing magazine the Spectator. He is chair of its parent company, Press Holdings, which is owned by the billionaire Barclay Brothers.The BBC has previously insisted that, regardless of his personal views, Neil abides by strict impartiality rules and treats politicians of all parties equally while on air.In his tweets Neil also criticised the BBC’s political satire show The Mash Report as “self satisfied, self adulatory, unchallenged leftwing propaganda”.“When it comes to so-called comedy the BBC has long given up on balance, on radio and TV. Nobody seems to care. And I don’t want rightwing comedy, whatever that is. I’d just like comedy. Which is in really short supply. On TV and radio.”He also said the Primal Scream singer Bobby Gillespie, who recently looked on stony-faced as Neil danced on the set of This Week, was a “miserable jock” who likes to “spout Corbynista propaganda from his fancy Islington pad”.Neil has cut back on his TV commitments since marrying Susan Nilsson in a 2015 ceremony in the south of France. In addition to This Week he presents Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions edition of Politics Live."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9decace90bb0a15a7e8889e2046f27a3ce61b2be/0_72_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a76ce2cdd66493d5bfd7d4376ac655","title":"support guardian readers future journalism","story":"By supporting our journalism, you can become part of a global community of over a million  readers with a shared set of core values and a vision for a more hopeful worldThank you to the 1,000,000  readers who have offered us their support over the past three years.

This is a time for pulling together, for making sure that we remember who we are here to serve, to help, the whole of the country,” she said.“I am worried that some of our colleagues are too concerned about the Westminster bubble, rather than keeping our eye on what our job is, to serve people.”At least 23 Conservative MPs were known to have submitted letters of no-confidence to Graham Brady, chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, on Friday.The former Brexit minister Steve Baker, who is orchestrating the challenge, suggested the target of 48, which would trigger a no-confidence vote, was likely to be reached over the weekend.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, reacted with fury to Rudd’s return to frontline politics so soon. She tweeted: “Amber Rudd resigned because of her mismanagement of Windrush scandal. Now Theresa May puts her in the DWP. Let’s hope she shows more concern for the victims of this department’s unfairness and cruelty than she did at the Home Office.”Barclay, the MP for North East Cambridgeshire since 2010 and a Brexiter, had been a junior health minister since June 2017. A former director of Barclays Bank who trained as a solicitor and also worked as a financial regulator, Barclay was also City minister.Among Rudd’s immediate tasks will be steering through the Commons the secondary legislation to allow the so-called “managed migration” of people still receiving some of the six benefits that universal credit replaces on to the new system, a huge task fraught with difficulties.Rudd stepped down as home secretary in April after telling the home affairs committee that her department had no targets for deportations under the “hostile environment” policy, a claim swiftly disproved by documents leaked to the .She was already under huge pressure over revelations about the treatment of members of the Windrush generation, people who arrived from the Caribbean decades before but were wrongly targeted for deportation and other sanctions because they could not prove their status.It subsequently emerged that an internal Home Office report criticised senior officials for misinforming Rudd before her appearance at the committee amid a series of confusions and miscommunications.May also lost a series of junior ministers and government aides amid the disquiet at her Brexit plans. As part of the reshuffle, the MPs Stephen Hammond, John Penrose and Kwasi Kwarteng were given junior jobs in the health, Northern Ireland and Brexit departments.In an interview with Saturday’s Daily Mail, May acknowledged she had experienced a “pretty heavy couple of days”. However, she attempted to play down the impact on herself personally, saying it had been harder for her husband, Philip, to watch. “He does feel some of the hurt. We’ve been married for 38 years, that’s a long time. He is my rock.” She said he had to turn off some of the critical coverage of her on the TV and had brought her a large whisky when she finished Wednesday’s five-hour meeting, where her cabinet gave their initial backing to the Brexit deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a51de5c53800e86a7f7e62e9198119aeca8cd483/0_140_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=558b725098be5b6e93fae64bee13ae45","title":"brexit deal take it or leave it eu tells britain","story":"EU member states collectively rule out any redrafting of withdrawal agreementEuropean leaders have launched a campaign to sell the Brexit deal struck with Theresa May on a “take it or leave it” basis as EU ambassadors in Brussels collectively agreed it would be impossible to make major changes.Putting aside the anxieties of some about the 585-page withdrawal text, the 27 member states collectively ruled out a redrafting of the agreement by either side during a meeting with Michael Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator.Barnier had told the EU ambassadors they should not engage in “bargaining”, despite the political situation in the UK. A number of British cabinet ministers are said to have chosen to stay in their posts purely to engineer a change in the agreement.France and Germany did press the European commission to put more “positive” language into the draft political declaration on the future trade deal that will accompany the withdrawal agreement, which is still being negotiated with the British. Olly Robbins, Downing Street’s Brexit adviser, was in Brussels on Friday and will return on Saturday.Ambassadors for France and Germany called for a preamble to be added to the seven-page document due to be published on Tuesday in which both sides would commit to “an ambitious and deep relationship”, echoing the prime minister’s own previous language.There were also moves to toughen demands on the UK in the political declaration in terms of the trade-off between access to British waters for EU fishing fleets and UK firms’ ability to sell fish into the European market.A section on the “level playing field” requirements of the UK is also likely to be strengthened, with calls for “dynamic alignment” with a host of Brussels regulations, to reassure EU member states that Britain will not enjoy a competitive advantage from a future deal, in a move that could further poison the political atmosphere in London.EU diplomats insisted, however, that the member states were in a mood to “help and assist” the prime minister.Their leaders lined up later in the day on Friday to emphasise that a renegotiation of the 107,000-word draft withdrawal treaty was not on the cards and highlight the risk to the British economy of parliament rejecting what has been agreed with Downing Street.The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, told reporters in Brussels: “It is a good deal for both sides. Nobody has been cheated. This deal prevents a hard Brexit. Therefore it helps us in Europe, but even more so it helps Great Britain because a hard Brexit would hit Great Britain significantly more severely.”The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, insisted that EU countries would not be willing to change the proposed Brexit deal.“It is highly unlikely that we will make important changes to these proposals”, Rutte said. “We have talked about this for so long, everybody has been heavily involved. We will have a good look at parts of the proposals, but major changes seem unlikely to me.”The Irish PM, Leo Varadkar, said he could not see “much room” for a renegotiation, warning that enforcing changes could “see the whole thing unravel”.Emmanuel Macron’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, attending a trade forum in Paris, warned British MPs of the “economic disaster” facing the UK should it reject the offer on the table.“The choice now faced by British political leaders who have advocated Brexit is to renounce their absurd political promise or face economic disaster, with the British people the main victims,” the French minister said.“There are a number of lying and irresponsible politicians in Britain who told the British people that Brexit would turn out to be a golden tomorrow … The truth is that Brexit could end with a nightmare.”In a meeting with Barnier earlier in the day, the French EU ambassador had tempered Paris’s calls for more positive language with a request for a recital of the EU’s position on the “inisibility” of the single market.In Madrid, Isabel Celaá, the education minister who also serves as spokeswoman for Spain’s governing socialist party, described the provisional deal as a success for both parties, warning it would be “far better to end up with a deal than with a split”.“Like any deal, it’s obviously not perfect, but it still represents a success for the European Union and for the United Kingdom – if it comes off,” she said.One EU senior diplomat said a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement was an “impossible” request and that the EU had to trust the agreement it had with the British government. “Even if Theresa May falls, we have an agreement with the government,” the diplomat said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9677374f0a3efcd8db3d1b27d83d4e68c847b745/0_110_6079_3648/master/6079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06f2fa963855ef8ff089904d163ed31d","title":"brexit paranoid fantasy fintan otoole","story":"In the dark imagination of English reactionaries, Britain is always a defeated nation – and the EU is the imaginary invaderBefore the narrative of Len Deighton’s bestselling thriller SS-GB begins, there is a “reproduction” of an authentic-looking rubber-stamped document: “Instrument of Surrender – English Text. Of all British armed forces in United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland including all islands.” It is dated 18 February 1941. After ordering the cessation of all hostilities by British forces, it sets down further conditions, including “the British Command to carry out at once, without argument or comment, all further orders that will be issued by the German Command on any subject. Disobedience of orders, or failure to comply with them, will be regarded as a breach of these surrender terms and will be dealt with by the German Command in accordance with the laws and usages of war.”Written amid the anxieties of Britain’s early membership of the European Communities and published in 1978, Deighton’s thriller sets up two ideas that will become important in the rhetoric of Brexit. Since there is no sense that Deighton has a conscious anti-EU agenda, the idea seems to arise from a deeper structure of feeling in England. One is the fear of the Englishman turning into the “new European”, fitting himself into the structures of German domination. His central character is a harbinger of the “rootless cosmopolitan” who cannot be trusted to uphold English independence and English values, and who therefore functions as the enemy within, the quisling class of pro-Europeans. This is the treason of the elite, the puppet politicians and sleek mandarins who quickly accommodate themselves to the new regime.Deighton was building on real historical memories of the appeasers whose prewar conduct makes the notion that they would have quickly become collaborators in the event of a defeat to the Nazis highly credible. This idea of a treacherous elite would later ferment into a heady and intoxicating brew of suspicion that the Brexiteers would both dispense to the masses and consume themselves. (In 2014, the BBC announced plans for a five-part TV version, which was screened in 2017, shortly after Brexit.)The other crucial idea here is the vertiginous fall from “heart of Empire” to “occupied colony”. In the imperial imagination, there are only two states: dominant and submissive, coloniser and colonised. This dualism lingers. If England is not an imperial power, it must be the only other thing it can be: a colony. And, as Deighton successfully demonstrated, this logic can be founded in an alternative English history. The moment of greatest triumph – the defeat of the Nazis – can be reimagined as the moment of greatest humiliation – defeat by the Nazis. The pain of colonisation and defeat can, in the context of uneasy membership of the EU, be imaginatively appropriated. (Boris Johnson, in the  of 12 November, claimed that “we are on the verge of signing up for something even worse than the current constitutional position. These are the terms that might be enforced on a colony.”)SS-GB was in part the inspiration for an even more successful English thriller, Robert Harris’s multimillion-selling Fatherland, published in 1992 and filmed for television in 1994. Harris had begun the novel in the mid-1980s but abandoned it. He revived and finished it explicitly in the context of German reunification in 1990 and of fears that the enemy Britain had defeated twice in the 20th century would end the century by dominating it: “If,” Harris wrote in the introduction to the 20th anniversary edition in 2012, “there was one factor that suddenly gave my fantasy of a united Germany a harder edge, it was the news that exactly such an entity was unexpectedly returning to the heart of Europe.”In retrospect, German reunification is perhaps the greatest missed opportunity for the English finally to have done with the war. Had there been a capacity to generate new narratives of Europe, this could have been shaped as a moment of British vindication – the final working-out of the consequences of nazism. As Anthony Barnett puts it, “the triumph and relief of the unification of Germany could and should have belonged to us in Britain, as well as to Germany itself. It was the final liberation from nazism, the end of that country’s punishment, a time to welcome a great culture back into our arms.”Why, then, were there no photographs of Margaret Thatcher and Helmut Kohl holding hands at the Brandenburg Gate to match the pictures of Kohl and François Mitterrand at Verdun in 1984? Because Thatcher literally carried in her handbag maps showing German expansion under the Nazis. This was a mental cartography that English conservatism could not transcend – the map of a Europe that may no longer exist in reality, but within which its imagination remains imprisoned. “Europe,” Barnett writes, “moved on from the second world war and Britain didn’t.” One might go so far as to say that England never got over winning the war.In fact, Britain not only did not move on in 1990 – with the resurrection of a united Germany, it moved back. Harris is no anti-European reactionary and would become one of the most furious critics of Brexit. Yet, like Deighton, he was tapping into profound national anxieties.The real twist of the knife in Harris’s story is that the novel is set in Germany and the main characters are German. There is nothing of significance to say about England 20 years after its surrender. Except, that is, that is part of a European Union: “In the west, 12 nations – Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, Great Britain, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland – had been corralled by Germany, under the Treaty of Rome, into a European trading bloc. German was the official second language in all schools. People drove German cars, listened to German radios, watched German televisions, worked in German-owned factories, moaned about the behaviour of German tourists in German-dominated holiday resorts, while German teams won every international sporting competition except cricket, which only the English played.”A dystopian fantasy this may be, but in the English reactionary imagination, dystopian fantasy was and is indistinguishable from reality. Rhetorically, it was commonplace among British anti-Europeans that the EU was a continuation in another, more insidious form, of previous attempts at domination from the continent. In 1989, for example, the Bruges Group of anti-European Tories heard Prof Kenneth Minogue of the London School of Economics tell them that “the European institutions were attempting to create a European Union, in the tradition of the mediaeval popes, Charlemagne, Napoleon, the Kaiser and Adolf Hitler”.The cover of that issue of the Spectator’s bore the headline “Speaking for England” – a conscious reference to one of the moments of high drama in September 1939 when Leo Amery in the House of Commons invited Labour’s Arthur Greenwood to “Speak for England!”, implying that the appeasing prime minister Neville Chamberlain did not do so.Ridley’s remarks were dismissed by Lutz Stavenhagen, minister of state in the German foreign office, as the sort of thing that might be heard “in the pub after a football match”. And Ridley himself had to resign. But these were not the mere rantings of a marginal crank. As Peter Jenkins wrote in the Independent at the time, “it is widely supposed that Mrs Thatcher’s heart is with him, if not her head … It is no secret that she, like him, fears that monetary and economic union in Europe will become the tool of German domination rather than the means of containing a united Germany. She too instinctively mistrusts the Germans and finds it impossible to forget the experiences of the second world war.”Thatcher had the Falklands war. It may have been a last hurrah for Britain’s imperial pretensions, but it functioned even better as a kind of epilogue to the great psychodrama of the second world war and a real-life version of the invasion thrillers. In her victory speech of July 1982, Thatcher was quite explicit in invoking the Falklands as a renaissance of the old wartime spirit, and victory as proof that Britain was no different then from what it had been during its Finest Hour. She chided those who believed that “we could never again be what we were”. The doubters “were wrong. The lesson of the Falklands is that Britain has not changed and that this nation still has those sterling qualities which shine through our history. This generation can match their fathers and grandfathers in ability, in courage, and in resolution. We have not changed. When the demands of war and the dangers to our own people call us to arms – then we British are as we have always been.”Yet even in this triumphal mode, Thatcher gave new life to the metaphors of retreat and invasion. “We have ceased to be a nation in retreat,” she said, implying that the nation had been precisely that for a long time. “Why,” she asked, “do we have to be invaded before we throw aside our selfish aims and begin to work together … ?”Within this question is a claim: “we” were invaded. The beauty of the Falklands conflict is that it played out the invasion fantasy of SS-GB – a fascist regime violating the sanctity of the homeland – but at a safe distance of almost 8,000 miles. The tiny population of the Falklands – 1,820 people in 1982 – served as a metaphor for the UK. “British people,” said Thatcher, “had to be threatened by foreign soldiers and British territory invaded and then – why then – the response was incomparable.” What had not happened in 1939–45 had finally happened in 1982.It helped that the tiny Falklands population that was serving this microcosmic function was almost entirely white – a “British people” that no longer existed – and that this “British territory” was an almost entirely rural landscape. The Falklands was a kind of make-believe England with no black and brown immigrants. Its pre-industrial terrain was a fantasy version of the post-industrial landscape that Thatcher herself was in fact creating at home in England, without the empty steel plants and rusting machines.It was not just war that was needed to reassure Britain that it had a meaningful collective existence, it was the idea of invasion and submission.There could be no release from the dark fantasies haunting the imagination of British conservatism, and there would continue to be a need for an imaginary invader and dominator. In 1990, while Germany was being reunified, there was very little depth to anti-German feeling in Britain – surveys at the time showed that most British people were in favour of German unity and trusted the Germans a lot or somewhat. The imagining of a German-dominated Europe through the evocation of Hitler was not an authentic popular prejudice against an old enemy. It was a way – albeit one that still seemed to have few real-world consequences – of thinking about the European Union itself, of summoning it into being as the ghastly ghost, not just of the Nazis, but of Nazis who had in reality won the war.The war imagery filled a hole. England had no deep imaginative commitment to the European project. As an idea, the EU had a distinctly weak grip on English allegiance. It was always understood by most people as a more or less grudging concession to reality, a matter for resigned acceptance rather than joyous embrace. The popular mood a year after Britain joined was nicely captured by an official at the Department of Trade and Industry, who likened the British public to “a crowd of holidaymakers who, after much doubt and expense, have made a dangerous journey only to find the climate chilly, the hotel not what it was cracked up to be and the food too expensive … bloodthirsty feelings are mounting, not only towards the other nationalities in the hotel but to the courier who got them there.”Yet a result that seemed both decisive and conclusive proved to be neither – Europe continued to poison British politics. And perhaps one of the reasons it did so is that, as the 1975 referendum campaign showed, there was a very deep underlying ision about the meaning of the second world war. The war was – and remains – crucial in structuring English feeling about the European Union. In 1975, many of the leading advocates on both sides were veterans, as were many voters. But instead of this common experience creating a common emotional ideal of Britain’s relationship to Europe, it fed two completely opposite stories, each very deeply felt.One of these stories was that the catastrophic experience of the first half of the 20th century carried two lessons that must never be forgotten: unrestrained nationalism led to war, and Britain could not stand aside from the fate of Europe. As the historian Robert Saunders has shown, the successful pro-European campaigners in 1975 were both highly explicit and highly emotive in making these connections. For them, “the emphasis was on the horror of war, which had devoured millions of lives in the prosecution of national rivalries. Britain in Europe used the poppy, the flower of remembrance, in its literature, while its logo was a dove of peace.” Pro-Europe posters said “Nationalism kills” and “No more Civil Wars”. Another, published for the anniversary of victory in Europe, directly evoked the joy of that triumph and sought to channel it into a sense that the common market was the great reward for victory: “On VE Day we celebrated the beginnings of peace. Vote Yes to make sure we keep it.” Another poster read simply: “Forty million people died in two European wars this century. Better lose a little sovereignty than a son or daughter.”These appeals worked for the majority of voters, but this very mention of sovereignty opened up, for a significant minority, a gaping wound. “For some,” wrote Saunders, “the surrender of national sovereignty to the EEC was a betrayal of all those who had fought and died ‘to deliver Europe from Nazi dictatorship’.” A woman from Bournemouth wrote to the anti-EEC Labour minister Barbara Castle that “I … did not fight and suffer a war for six years to be dictated to by the Germans.” “Hitler’s ghost,” wrote another of Castle’s correspondents, “must be shaking with laughter at Roy Jenkins, Hattersley \u0026amp the rest of the traitor crew.” Some, Saunders writes, “viewed the Community as a new power-grab by Germany, a country which ‘on two occasions … has failed to conquer the British militarily’”. For Castle’s correspondents, the notion “that the GERMANS love us any more today than they did in 1914 \u0026amp 1939” was dismissed with contempt. “The leopard does not easily change its spots.”What’s striking is that we can begin to see in this hysterical rhetoric the outlines of two notions that would become crucial to Brexit discourse. One is the comparison of pro-European Brits to quislings, collaborators, appeasers and traitors. The leave campaign in 1975 likened the treaty of accession to the Munich agreement of 1938, remembered as a shameful act of surrender to the Germans. Christopher Frere-Smith, who ran the Get Britain Out campaign, warned repeatedly that accession to the common market marked a “new Munich”, with Ted Heath and Roy Jenkins (who was leading the in campaign) playing the roles of Neville Chamberlain and his foreign secretary Lord Halifax. Voters were warned not be “fooled by the press bosses and the establishment politicians. They were wrong about Hitler and they’re wrong again.”But the other idea is the fever-dream of an English Resistance, and its weird corollary: a desire to have actually been invaded so that one could – gloriously – resist. And not just resist but, in the ultimate apotheosis of masochism, die. Part of the allure of romantic anti-imperial nationalism is martyrdom. The executed leaders of the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, for example, stand as resonant examples of the potency of the myth of blood sacrifice. But in the ironic reversal of zombie imperialism, the appropriation of the imagery of resistance to a former colonising power, this romance of martyrdom is mobilized as defiance of the EU.In his anguished complaint about the vitiating effects of membership of the common market in 1977, Enoch Powell lamented: “The breath which condemns submission to laws this nation has not made condemns submission to scales of value which this nation had not willed. To both sorts of submission I ascribe the haunting fear, which I am sure I am not alone in feeling, that we, the British, will soon have nothing left to die for. That was not a slip of the tongue. What a man lives for is what a man dies for, because every bit of living is a bit of dying. Patriotism is to have a nation to die for, and to be glad to die for it – all the days of one’s life.” This takes martyrdom to new levels of self-annihilating fantasy: death in the anti-EU resistance is not a fate or even an act. It is a daily pleasure.The anti-Europe campaign in 1975 very consciously evoked the language of wartime resistance. The Common Market Safeguards Campaign published a newspaper called Resistance News, and the group of MPs around the leading Tory leaver, Neil Marten, was known as the “R” Group – R for resistance. During the war, Marten had been dropped into both France and Norway to work with the resistance movements, so presumably his followers could think of themselves operating behind enemy lines in deepest Dorset. All of this is much more ’Allo, ’Allo! than Army of Shadows – tragedy played out the second time as farce. But, in what would become the camp sitcom of Brexit, that would not diminish its force.Europe’s role in this weird psychodrama is entirely pre-scripted. It does not greatly matter what the European Union is or what it is doing – its function in the plot is to be a more insidious form of nazism. This is important to grasp, because one of the key arguments in mainstream pro-Brexit political and journalistic discourse would be that Britain had to leave because the Europe it had joined was not the Europe it found itself part of in 2016. In Andrew Gilligan’s formulation on the 40th anniversary of British accession in the  in 2012, “the British people joined, and were happy to join, a common market. They did not sign up to a social chapter, a single currency or any moves down the road to a superstate.” Or as Boris Johnson put it in September 2017, the “post-imperial future” was “sold to the people purely as a common market, a way of maximising trade”. But “then came the gradual realisation that this was a very different agenda, an attempt not just at economic but political integration of a kind that the British people had never bargained for.” In itself, this is no more than usually mendacious – the truth being that “ever closer union” was always an explicit part of what the British signed up to in 1973 and voted for in 1975.What matters, though, is the way it misses the point. The idea of Europe as a soft-Nazi superstate was vividly present in 1975, even when the still-emerging EU had a much weaker, less evolved and less intrusive form. The imaginary existential struggle between the gallant English Resistance and the Euroreich was already being played out in one part of English consciousness. It was not a product of the ways in which the nine-member Common Market became the 28-member European Union. It was a product of England’s deeply ided and strangely unsettled relationship to the second world war and what it meant.Yet what brings these disparate modes together is the lure of self-pity, the weird need to dream England into a state of awful oppression. If we return to Nicholas Ridley’s rant, the striking thing is the way it wishes Britain back into wartime: “I’d rather have the shelters and the chance to fight back.” This suggests that what Britain was experiencing in the 1990s at the hands of the EU was actually worse than the war of 1939–45 in which it triumphed. And what could be worse than winning the war? Only losing it. Ridley’s conjuring of the EU as a “German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe” evokes a worse kind invasion than that in Deighton’s SS-GB: invasion by stealth. The suggestion is that a physical invasion by the Nazis would have been preferable to the membership of the EU which achieved the same ends by more cunning and dishonourable means. At least the Nazis could have been, in Churchill’s great and galvanic rhetoric, fought on the beaches, hills, fields and streets. They offered the “chance to fight back”.The new German invasion, cloaked in the guise of peaceful cooperation, is more damnable because it does not give the English Resistance a proper physical target. Hostility to the EU thus opens the way to a bizarre logic in which a Nazi invasion would have been, relatively speaking, welcome. This is a deeply strange kind of displacement – a victor learning to think like the vanquished. But it makes a kind of sense. On the one hand, as the white paper on entry to the common market emphasised in 1971, the experience of not being invaded was one of the genuinely distinctive things about being British: “Our physical assets and our economy had suffered less disastrously than those of other western European countries as a result of the war: nor did we suffer the shock of invasion. We were thus less immediately conscious of the need for us to become part of the unity in Europe.”Yet the paper went on to contrast the fate of Britain since the war with that of the six members of the existing common market, all of whom had been invaded: “The contrast between their experiences in recent years as members of the Communities, and ours outside, when our resources have not been growing sufficiently to do all we should like to do at home and abroad, suggests that they chose the right road … All the Community countries enjoyed rates of growth of gross national product (GNP) per head of population, or of private consumption per head, roughly twice as great as Britain’s.” It was not entirely ridiculous at some subliminal level to see these two things – being invaded and growing twice as fast as the country that wasn’t – as cause and effect. The “right road” to prosperity did not seem to lie through successful self-defence – on the contrary, invasion worked well for the six.Britain was genuinely in a topsy-turvy situation, the winner that had been surpassed by the losers. Why not draw a topsy-turvy conclusion: in a dark stratum of the reactionary mind, we must think of ourselves as a defeated nation? And if Britain was to be defeated, the EU must be its invasive oppressor. Must be, because there was no other possible candidate. The very absurdity of this notion was its strength. The paranoiac must at some stage ask himself: but why are they out to get me? Since there was no actual evidence of any western European hostility, the answer must lie in some deeply hidden motivation. How could they hate us when we saved them in the war? The proto-Brexiteers came up with a counter-factual truth that was at the same time highly satisfying: they hate us because we saved them.Since the English mood in relation to joining Europe was largely one of surrendering to necessity, it was not so hard to think of the act as surrender full stop. In the literary journal Encounter’s 1971 symposium on whether the UK should join the common market, for example, Sir William Hayter, warden of New College, Oxford, and former British ambassador to Moscow, looked back on his contribution to its debates almost a decade earlier: “in 1962 I wrote that ‘in a few years we shall have to make an unconditional surrender to get in’. I am afraid those few years have gone by, and now it is not even certain that an unconditional surrender will get us in.” Peter Shore MP, the most persistent Labour party critic of Europe, during the 1975 referendum took up this theme: “What the advocates of membership are saying … is that we are finished as a country that the long and famous story of the British nation and people has ended that we are now so weak and powerless that we must accept terms and conditions, penalties and limitations almost as though we had suffered defeat in a war.” It was a masochistic rhetoric that would return in full force as the Brexit negotiations failed to produce the promised miracles.This is an edited extract from Heroic Failures: Brexit and the Politics of Pain by Fintan O’Toole, published on 22 November by Head of Zeus, and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7700b3d1b95ac5bec0c29b0970ec89ccad140f27/0_102_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a56e647188eb782a7b1f57662aaa13a","title":"its a farce isnt it the view from manchester a remain stronghold","story":"“It’s a farce isn’t it?” said Michelle Hinds, self-medicating against Brexit with the help of a glass of wine on Friday afternoon. “To be totally honest, I’ve switched off from it.

He had just spent a few hours reading the paper in Starbucks, bringing himself up to speed on the negotiations, and was still confused about what was going on. “Every 10 minutes another minister is resigning and nobody seems to know what the right thing is to do. There are such conflicting messages,” he said. “No one seems to want to take the decision.”Sam Hibberd, 20, was also struggling to fathom what was going on. “I voted to stay in because my family told me it would be easier when we went on holiday and stuff. You hear about it all the time: Brexit this, Brexit that, but I don’t understand it all. I do think we will leave in the next two years but I don’t think we will be better off. It’s more hassle than it’s worth.”Visiting from Cork in Ireland, 25-year-old nurse Kim O’Keefe believes not enough people in the UK are worrying about the implications for her country. “I don’t think there’s enough emphasis on the Irish border question in the British press and I don’t like the feeling that we are going backwards, not forwards.

A spokesperson said household incomes were at a record high, income inequality had fallen and that universal credit, which Alston attacked as “Orwellian” and “fast falling into universal discredit”, was supporting people into work faster.“We are absolutely committed to helping people improve their lives while providing the right support for those who need it,” the spokesperson said.Alston’s report follows similar audits of extreme poverty in China, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, Mauritania and the US. Donald Trump’s White House administration launched a furious response after the US was accused of pursuing policies that deliberately forced millions of Americans into financial ruin while lavishing vast riches on the super-wealthy.Charities working to alleviate poverty said the report on the UK was a “wake-up call for government”.It is likely to crystallise growing public unease over the impact of nearly a decade of cuts to the welfare state and public services, which studies have shown have had a disproportionate effect on the poor, the disabled and women. Soaring use of food banks, increasingly visible homelessness and cuts to school budgets have widened concerns about the Conservative party’s fiscal strategy.After visiting towns and cities including London, Oxford, Cardiff, Newcastle, Glasgow and Belfast, Alston said that “obvious to anyone who opens their eyes to see the immense growth in food banks and the queues waiting outside them, the people sleeping rough in the streets, the growth of homelessness, the sense of deep despair that leads even the government to appoint a minister for suicide prevention and civil society to report in depth on unheard-of levels of loneliness and isolation”.He called for the elimination of the five-week delay in receiving benefits under the universal credit system, which has plunged many into destitution. Flaws in its design and implementation harmed claimants’ mental health, finances and work prospects, and benefits sanctions were “harsh and arbitrary”. Vulnerable claimants “struggled to survive”, he said.The ministers he met – including Esther McVey, who was the work and pensions secretary until Thursday, when she resigned over the Brexit deal – were almost entirely dismissive of criticisms of welfare changes and universal credit, he said. Instead, they described critics as political saboteurs or said they failed to understand how it worked.He highlighted the chancellor’s decision in this month’s budget to give a tax cut to the rich rather than using that money to alleviate poverty for millions, adding: “Austerity could easily have spared the poor, if the political will had existed to do so.”Alston said the government was in a state of denial and there was a “striking disconnect” between what ministers said and the testimonies he heard from ordinary people.“Even while devolved authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland are frantically trying to devise ways to ‘mitigate’, or in other words counteract, at least the worst features of the government’s benefits policy, ministers insisted to me that all is well and running according to plan.”He said he had met people who did not have a safe place for their children to sleep, people who had sold sex for money or shelter, young people who felt gangs were the only way out of destitution, and people with disabilities who were being told they needed to go back to work or lose support, against their doctors’ orders. He described how town hall budgets had been “gutted” in England resulting in a record sell-off of libraries and parks and closures of youth centres.“I have also seen tremendous resilience, strength and generosity, with neighbours supporting one another, councils seeking creative solutions and charities stepping in to fill holes in government services,” he said.On food banks, he said: “I was struck by how much their mobilisation resembled the sort of activity you might expect for a natural disaster or health epidemic.”A common theme of the testimonies he heard was the impact on people’s mental health and feelings of loneliness and fear. “I was surprised by the talk of suicide, by the people I met who said they had considered suicide … There are some pretty serious mental health dimensions.”In his conclusion, Alston called for “the legislative recognition of social rights” in the UK, a move that has long been resisted by UK governments but which is the status quo in countries such as Sweden and Germany.“Labour will stop the roll-out of universal credit, end the benefit freeze and transform the social security system so that it supports people instead of punishing them.”Universal credit has punched us in the face.

Not just any old bunch of silver ferns, either, but a team unbeaten in Tests on European soil since 2012 and still the world’s No 1 side. New Zealand are knocked from their rankings perch about as often as Steve Hansen fancies doing Strictly Come Dancing.Ireland, though, are increasingly sure-footed on the game’s biggest stages. At home they have not lost in their last 10 Tests, dating back to New Zealand’s contentious 21-9 victory two years ago. Under Joe Schmidt they now march to a different tune to previous Irish squads. The 40-29 victory over the All Blacks in Chicago in 2016 will always be celebrated but their ambitions remain far from satisfied.As current Six Nations grand slam champions and the world’s second-best team, the chance to take another giant leap beneath the Dublin floodlights now presents itself. New Zealand cannot yet be overhauled in the rankings but they can be undermined psychologically. Hansen’s men, by their own high standards, have wobbled slightly of late and should probably have lost three of their tricky quartet of recent Tests against South Africa (twice), Australia and England. Had England not let a 15-0 first-half lead slip at Twickenham, this week’s mood music would have been appreciably darker.Ireland, either way, have shed any last vestige of an inferiority complex.

Ireland will seek to play as Eddie Jones’s side did in the first half-hour last Saturday: quick, brusque, direct, hard-nosed and relentless.Motivation will not be a problem, with the heavy-duty, painfully physical loss to the same opponents at the Aviva Stadium in this corresponding fixture two years ago still the subject of much debate. A number of incidents that day would now earn instant red cards and Ireland, while obliged to keep it legal, will be physically braced this time. “Spiky” is the word Schmidt has been using: it will be that and more.All of which makes for the year’s most compelling 80 minutes – “You can’t say it’s just another game,” murmured Johnny Sexton this week – with no shortage of riveting plotlines. The last time Sexton encountered Beauden Barrett, during the drawn 2017 Lions series, it was the former who enjoyed the last laugh. Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock may be packing down as a starting duo for a record 50th time in New Zealand’s boiler room but eclipsing the 6ft 10in Devin Toner will be tough. And then there is Schmidt, the brains behind it all. An Ireland win could just see the 53-year-old succeed Hansen as the coach of the All Blacks from 2020 onwards, which would be more than a touch ironic.What a springboard, too, it would give Ireland heading into next year’s World Cup in Japan. Not unlike England in 2003, a compelling victory over New Zealand en route to the tournament would validate everything they are doing and send a message around the rugby world. If they do it, moreover, without Conor Murray, their scrum-half totem, and another absent Lion, the flanker Sean O’Brien, it will be all the more striking.They cannot assume, however, that the visitors will do the job for them. New Zealand, in particular, still boast Retallick, the scourge of England. Neither he nor Whitelock were involved in Chicago and both will be central on Saturday evening. Disrupt Ireland in the lineout and you cut out their heart and lungs: Retallick is the forward the All Blacks would least like to see dropping to one knee in the opening moments.Ireland will also be anxious to get to Aaron Smith, about to win his 82nd cap, and limit Damian McKenzie’s exhilarating footwork to his own 22. Mostly, though, they will be concentrating on building pressure, looking after the ball and then striking, when the moment comes, to maximum effect. As Hansen observed this week: “They’ll find a weakness and they’ll punish you. He’s pretty good, Joe, at finding a trick or two so we’ll be expecting one or two.”Kiwis of a certain age already know what it is like to lose a Test in Dublin. It almost feels like rugby’s Old Testament now but New Zealand’s defeat to Australia in the 1991 World Cup semi-final at the old Lansdowne Road still echoes down the years. It was David Campese’s finest hour: the no-look pass over his shoulder to Tim Horan, the diagonal dagger finish in the left corner. The modern All Blacks will not have to counter Campo’s genius but, as with that fine Wallaby side, Ireland have sufficient wit to make life hugely difficult.Will it, ultimately, be enough? New Zealand, if the sky does fall in on them, can hardly say they were not warned. Only Ryan Crotty’s last-gasp try saved them in Dublin in 2013, since when Ireland have unearthed a golden generation of players – James Ryan, Tadhg Furlong, Garry Ringrose and Jacob Stockdale – far more accustomed to winning than losing.New Zealand also look less settled in certain pivotal positions and Ireland’s defence coach, Andy Farrell, has a proven knack of throttling All Black ambition in big games like this. Ireland have won five and lost five when Saturday’s referee, Wayne Barnes, has been in charge but shaking hands with a northern hemisphere referee on a mild November afternoon in Dublin will add to New Zealand’s faint stirrings of unease.IrelandR Kearney K Earls, G Ringrose, B Aki, J Stockdale J Sexton, K Marmion C Healy, R Best (capt), T Furlong, D Toner, J Ryan, P O’Mahony, J van der Flier, CJ Stander.\u0026nbspReplacements\u0026nbspS Cronin, J McGrath, A Porter, I Henderson, J Murphy, L McGrath, J Carbery, J Larmour.Schmidt, either way, insists he will be delighted with “any old win against the All Blacks … I’ll take 3-0.” The drier conditions, in truth, will probably require his side to score upwards of 25 points, with the quick feet of Joey Carbery and Jordan Larmour potentially useful later. If Sexton stays on for an hour at least and Ireland can retain 15 players on the field, a famous home triumph is a real possibility. If, alternatively, New Zealand find a relieving Irish backstop under screeching pressure, the world champions will feel they can cope with anything in Japan next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03da81a705a0bbc2840a2a368cc6ea040b80aef6/0_146_2031_1219/master/2031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e32132f2785026296df87ec4eb01e91","title":"world chess championship game 6 carlsen caruana","story":"Magnus Carlsen narrowly avoided a devastating upset on Friday in the sixth game of his world championship match with Fabiano Caruana in London, scratching back from the brink to save a miraculous draw after 80 moves.The reigning world champion, playing with the white pieces for the first of two consecutive games, was outplayed in the middlegame by the American challenger and forced to rely on accurate defense with no margin for error over the last two hours to secure a peaceful result and preserve a 3-all deadlock at the halfway point of the the best-of-12-games showdown.Caruana, who missed a complex win in the late stages of the six-and-a-half-hour epic at the College at Holborn, came agonizingly close to a decisive upset that would have not only drawn first blood in the €1m ($1.14m) world title match, but would have propelled him to No 1 in the live world ratings, knocking Carlsen from the position he’s held since July 2011.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes.

With black I probably would have played more carefully early and in the middlegame.”A series of conservative and mostly straightforward draws had come to define the match in the week since it opened with a tense 115-move marathon over seven punishing hours. Friday’s sixth installment didn’t quite push those outer limits, but was marked with an extreme psychological intensity none of the previous games have been able to consistently match.Carlsen opened with a Petroff (1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6), playing directly to Caruana’s strength by opting for the the challenger’s opening of choice, then delivered an early surprise by bursting into the formation with (4. Nd3!?). The queens came out immediately after (5. Qe2 Qe7) and were off the board by the eighth move (6. Nf4 Nc6 7. Nd5 Nd4 8. Nxe7 Nxe2).Fifteen of the first 20 moves involved the knights after 9. Nd5 Nd4 10. Na3 Ne6 as both moved quickly, but the crisp pace slowed after 18. Kf2 and the formation of a symmetrical position with no apparent weaknesses on either side. Whatever advantage Carlsen had leveraged early was erased by 21. g3, when the computer assessed the position as dead even.“Just a few moves later I was fighting for equality,” Carlsen said afterward. “Then I got a bit unsettled.”From there Carlsen sought to simplify a position that was looking drawish with a rook exchange (31. Rxc8 Rxc8), but the sequence of moves only tipped the balance in Caruana’s direction. The margin for the American mounted with 7. ... Bd7 38. f5 Bc6 39. Bd1 and he soon found himself with a winning position.As the world No 2 continued to press the action, a clearly frustrated Carlsen refused to crack. He wrought a stroke of brilliance with a five-move flurry (43. ... Nd2 44. Bxd5 Bxe3 45. Bxc6 Bxf4 46. Bxb7 Bd6 47. Bxa6 Ne4 48. g4) that expended only 40 seconds on his clock, sacrificing a piece in exchange for three pawns with the goal of steering the position toward a draw. “It’s not the type of thing you go for if you have decent alternatives,” Carlsen said. “I don’t know what else I could have done anyway. I didn’t feel great about it.”The engines still favored Caruana even after Carlsen achieved his goal of simplification with 48. ... Ba3 49. Bc4 Kf8 50. g5 Nc3 51. b4 Bxb4 52. Kf3.The next stretch (53. ... Nc5 54. a4 f6 55. Kg4 Ne4 56. Kh5 Be1) showed the American in unmistakable pursuit of the win, but the Norwegian champion, who famously claimed he doesn’t “believe in fortresses” during his world title defense against Sergey Karjakin two years ago in New York, was content to take refuge in a defensive structure.“It’s a good thing they exist, right?” Carlsen quipped.The world No 1 moved deftly and with precision throughout the tense endgame as the match entered its seventh hour, even as the Stockfish evaluation engine found a forced mate in 30 moves for black after 67. Kg6.Caruana kept probing with 67. ... Bg5 and Carlsen answered with 68. Bc4!!. After the challenger’s 68. ... Nf3, the engine indicated his position was no longer winning, a realization made within minutes by the players as they consented to another peaceful result.Both Caruana and Carlsen will be grateful for Saturday’s rest day after Friday’s taxing affair before the match, the first world championship clash between the sport’s top two players in 28 years, resumes on Sunday with the champion playing as white in Game 7."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16be3a549b172adff20b7136584e8146b39da3de/0_129_3720_2233/master/3720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd883696c9be9c129be18acaa2f0f1e3","title":"cricket impressive england thrash south africa","story":"• South Africa 85, England 87-3 England win by seven wickets• Shrubsole claims hat-trick as bowlers turn on the styleAnya Shrubsole started her 2018 learning that she would be the first woman featured on the front cover of Wisden for her heroics in last year’s World Cup final. Now, becoming just the second player of her gender to take a hat-trick at the World T20, she has the chance to finish it with a second major trophy in two years with England all-but guaranteed progress to the final four after eliminating an abysmal South Africa by seven wickets with 35 balls to spare after bowling them out for 85.The achievement capped an immaculate all-round performance from Heather Knight’s side with the ball, not least from Shrubsole’s fellow seamer Nat Sciver who took three for four to make six for 15 from 7.3 overs between England’s frugal and effective openers.Despite not having lost a game, the legacy of their washed out opener against Sri Lanka on Saturday was that this fixture become virtual sudden death against the side they only just overcame in last year’s World Cup semi-final. But it was their opponents who played with that sense of timidity, bungling their power play and never recovering.As part of what Shrubsole later called “close to the perfect performance” from the bowlers, England’s trio of young left-arm orthodox spinners combined to squeeze the Proteas when the game was there to be set up. Linsey Smith was the first of those into the book, winning an edge from opener Laura Wolvaardt that was superbly pouched by wicketkeeper Amy Jones.Shortly thereafter, Kirstie Gordon, the Scottish spinner who took three wickets on her England debut on Monday, claimed the first of two breakthroughs when No 3 Marizanne Kapp struck a chance high into the sky. It was the third of the newcomers, Sophia Dunkley, who did the rest with her second assured outfield catch in her first two internationals.Later in that over, Gordon had presence of mind to throw a hand down at a straight drive, running out non-striker van Niekerk to leave South Africa’s innings reeling at 30 for four in the ninth over. Just as it was when they capitulated against West Indies in pursuit of 107 on Wednesday, they paid the price for an insipid start with Lizelle Lee – one of the world’s foremost plunderers – making just 12 from 26 balls before Sciver trapped her lbw.The initiative was belatedly taken by Chloe Tryon, who took 14 from the 17th over to bring a triple-figure target into striking distance. But sure enough, Sciver’s reintroduction brought her immediate downfall for 27 in what evolved into a double-wicket maiden. Shrubsole did the rest with the first three balls of the final over., The perfect off-cutter completed the job, bending back Yolani Fourie’s leg stump.With the 40-strong crew of England family and friends dancing in the aisles in St Lucia, Danielle Wyatt and Tammy Beaumont made sure of the result by putting on 41 in the power play, punctuated by a series of delightful cover drives from the former. She passed 1000 career runs in the process, nearly half coming since her move to the top of the order this time last year, where her strike rate has been 157.Shrubsole deflected with customary humility when asked about becoming the second woman to take a hat-trick in T20s for England. She did, however, heap praise on Sciver. “Nat has been outstanding with the new ball,” she said, noting that she had big shoes to fill when veteran quick Katherine Brunt pulled out with injury on the cusp of the tournament. “We have always known she is capable of this and she has shown it with the bat the past and now is with the ball in this tournament.”England’s play their final group game against the West Indies on Sunday, which – provided the West Indies defeat Sri Lanka as expected – will determine who tops Pool A when the tournament moves to Antigua for the semi-final stage next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2a19e945b6e9e6ce54b6d621e443b230e739c06/0_41_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50dfac5718969e6edbe31bcd868b6ba","title":"sri lanka v england third test day four live","story":"9th over: Sri Lanka 28-3 (Karunaratne 16, Mendis 1) Unrelenting accuracy from Anderson.

A sensible review by Root. And the 13th lbw of the match. England well, well, on top.  Mendis sweeps to the wrong ball and Leach has three before cornflakes. Umpire’s decision overturned by the review. A huge lbw appeal from Leach ....7th over: Sri Lanka 23-2 (Karunaratne 12, Mendis 1) Sri Lanka are jittery, going for a couple of tight runs just to keep the excitement levels up for England’s fielders. Anderson doing just the job Root will have wished from him. So many dogs watching OBO - who knew? “Morning Tanya,” writes Adam Levine. “I’m watching the cricket with Snoop Dogg, my Shnoodle who, incidentally, thought that the Jennings catch was the shizznits” Nor is Brian Withington alone, “Tanya In the interests of full pet disclosure, our three ex-Guide Dog Labrador cross Retrievers are currently sound asleep but would stir for breakfast at a moment’s notice, although possibly not quite as swiftly as a Ben Foakes stumping (and that’s praise indeed to some seriously good hands on that man).”6th over: Sri Lanka 20-2 (Karunaratne 10, Mendis 0) That really was a super catch by Jennings, the more you see it, the better it looks. Dhananjaya should have swept it, says Athers, instead he just steered it into Jennings’ paws. Four byes from the over as one of Leach’s spins past batsman, keeper and Stokes at slip. A fabulous catch at short leg from Keaton Jennings, snatched from the air at shin height with his left hand. 5th over: Sri Lanka 15-1 (Karunaratne 10, Dhananjaya 0) An ode to Anderson, ball after ball in the right spot as Karunaratne watchfully waits. A maiden, of course. Sam Curran is off the field with “discomfort on the right side”. Joe Denly his substitute fielder.

He thought that was a very smart piece of work by Foakes.”4th over: Sri Lanka 15-1 (Karunaratne 10, Dhananjaya 0) Leach, fiddling, fiddling with the ball at the top of his run, makes the breakthrough. He and Foakes, who played together here on that Lions tour a couple of years ago, combining together beautifully. Meanwhile Brian Withington is feeling empathy for YJB in Dorridge.“Greetings from not so sunny Dorridge. Sparing a thought for YJB watching even younger Foakes reinforce his cemented place in the England team. Straight fight between him and Ben Stokes for the floating specialist batsman and gun fielder slot now?”What a lovely piece of work by Foakes! Leach tosses it high, Kaushal dances down the pitch and is comprehensively five-card tricked. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Karunaratne 10, Kaushal 2) A smart maiden by Anderson. He roars an appeal to the fourth delivery, one that swings in and brushes Karunaratne’s pad before being caught behind. Root hums and hahs and looks very pained by the whole thing, but makes the right decision in not reviewing. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Karunaratne 10, Kaushal 2) And Root turns to spin straight away. Leach is on the money, but with a little bit of this, a little bit of that, Sri Lanka milk four from the over. Sri Lankan school children are chanting enthusiastically in the background.

It did the trick straight away and England walk off with a lead of 300 - another classy innings from Foakes and good sweeping-stoicism from Anderson.  Dilruwan takes the new ball mid-way through the over, it skids on a little more and Anderson is bowled80th over: England 346-9 (Anderson 12, Foakes 65) A change of bowling as Pushpakumara takes the cherry.

England’s lead now 291.  77th over: England 328-9 (Anderson 8, Foakes 51) Five dots from Akila Dananjaya’s over but some comedy fielding by Sri Lanka on the boundary, misreading the spin on a sweep from Anderson, and England get four.Actually play is just about to start right now.

Anyway, the good news is that it is hot and sunny at the Pallekele stadium and play will start on time..Good mid-November morning and welcome to the fourth day of the second Test against Sri Lanka, and what a cracker it should be. Sweeping was the verb of yesterday - getting England the majority of their runs, and Sri Lanka the majority of their wickets - (seven). Joe Root’s broom was particularly vigorous in the course of his century - “brave and brilliant” in the words of Vic Marks. He put on 82 with Ben Foakes, who is still there and reached his fifty with a six just before the heavens opened. England’s lead is 278 - any runs Foakes and Anderson can garner will be gratefully received in the England camp.Statty-stician-stuff (below) suggests that the pitch is likely to spin more today than it did yesterday - good news for England - though Sri Lanka’s batsmen must be more than competent sweepers themselves and who knows what yesterday’s downpour has done to conditions.If England do win today, or tomorrow, it would be their first series win in Sri Lanka for 17 years.An intriguing day ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/436b7dfb565a468c309f541d0f38d75f0b4f934e/53_287_1843_1106/master/1843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a152bddadf75b984a646f120079ef439","title":"jessie cave funniest things","story":"The standup, actor and cartoonist on the things that make her laugh the mostAlfie Brown in his show Scissor.

Washington last year banned its citizens from traveling to North Korea without special permission, the only country for which such a restriction exists.At their historic Singapore summit, Trump and Kim signed a vaguely worded document on denuclearisation of the peninsula.Progress has since stalled as Washington and Pyongyang spar over the meaning of the document.KCNA, meanwhile, reported that Kim had overseen the testing of a “newly developed ultramodern tactical weapon”.It marked the first official report of a weapons test by North Korea since it began the delicate diplomatic process with Washington.The US state department played down the announcement, saying it was “confident” that the negotiation process remained on track with North Korea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eab252980d19756e90e1e84bd38698ac12cc2623/0_290_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38c17460cb99c5c66a4c4b440ca7d48a","title":"apec leaders at odds over globalisation and free trade","story":"Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad warns economic integration leaving many behind but Australia, China and Russia condemn protectionismFault lines were quick to emerge over the future of free trade as leaders gathered for the Asia-Pacific summit on Saturday, with some calling for radical change while others argued for a return to the status quo on globalisation.Speaking at the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Papua New Guinea, the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, warned that globalisation was leaving some people behind and fuelling inequality.“The benefits of free and fair trade and economic integration have been ruptured, exemplified by Brexit and trade wars between major economies,” he said.“The trade war between the US and China has amplified further the disruption to our trade and commerce.”The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, followed by mounting a full-throated defence of free trade.“Our efforts must be about persuading and convincing our peoples again about the domestic benefits,” he said.Morrison said more than a billion people had been lifted out of extreme poverty since 1991 because of the jobs and more affordable consumer goods that free trade enabled.His speech was a clear reference to the escalating trade war between the United States and China, along with the general protectionism of the US president, Donald Trump.“We are witnessing a rising tide of trade protectionism along with financial volatility in some emerging economies,” Morrison said. “The test for us now is to stand up for the economic values we believe in and show how they work.”Speaking on a cruise ship tethered in Port Moresby’s Fairfax Harbour, the Russian prime minister, Dimitry Medvedev, joined Morrison in warning against growing protectionism and argued for clear-cut and transparent rules on trade.The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is not attending the Apec summit.The anti-protectionism sentiment was also echoed by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.The shadow of protectionism and unilaterism is hanging over global growth, Xi said, joining his global counterparts in pushing for free trade.China and the US have been locked in an escalating trade war since Trump won election in 2016.Trump has skipped the annual meeting of the 21-nation grouping, but the US vice-president, Mike Pence, is attending.Pence tweeted that he would discuss “Trump’s commitment to prosperity, security and freedom in the Indo-Pacific”.China has also been at loggerheads with the US over its territorial ambitions in the Pacific, encapsulated by Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative.Announced in 2013, the initiative aims to bolster a sprawling network of land and sea links with southeast Asia, central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.China’s efforts to win friends in the resource-rich Pacific have been watched warily by the traditionally influential powers in the region –

Ivan Cooper, John Hume, James Doherty, John Patton, Claude Wilton, Brendan Hinds. Aidan McKinney is in the third row, directly behind Dermie McClenaghan Terry Doherty’s hair is visible but his face is obscured behind Michael Canavan. Photograph: Larry DohertyOn a bright, cold Sunday morning, six men line up in the middle of Derry’s Craigavon Bridge.The moment – captured by Derry Journal photographer Larry Doherty – would become one of the iconic images of the civil rights era.Like many of those in the photograph, Michael Canavan keeps a framed copy hanging at home. Today, he has brought it with him, and as he and the other former marchers prepare to re-enact the famous picture for The  they crowd around it, recalling memories of the day and pointing out absent friends.“When I look at that photo, I’m remembering the people who aren’t here,” says Dermie McClenaghan.Chief among them is John Hume, who is too unwell to participate in total, 10 remain of those, eight are still resident in Derry, and only six – McClenaghan and Canavan, as well as Ivan Cooper, Fionnbarra Ó Dochartaigh, Terry Doherty and Aidan McKinney – are in sufficient health to return.Cooper, now in a wheelchair, was determined to attend. “I go to church on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but I couldn’t miss this.”Held on November 16th, 1968, the march was the city’s response to a much smaller protest a month earlier. That previous demonstration, on October 5th, had made world headlines when the marchers were attacked by the RUC and drenched with water cannons on nearby Duke Street. Among those present was Ó Dochartaigh: “We knew deep down we wanted change, and we weren’t going to wait another generation.”The Derry Citizens’ Action Committee (DCAC) was established Cooper was chairman, Hume vice-chairman. Fifty years on, the sense of history – and of occasion – is palpable among its surviving members as they introduce friends and family to their former comrades.McClenaghan has brought along his wife and Doherty his son and granddaughters, visiting from Italy photographer Larry Doherty’s daughters Dara and Moira have come to watch their father’s photograph re-enacted.It has been made possible by event controller Billy Scampton – well used to stewarding events for Derry City FC – and his police contacts at Strand Road in Derry, who have willingly agreed to halt the traffic at either end of the bridge while the picture is taken.The irony is not lost on those present. McKinney shakes his head, a wry smile on his face. “I can’t get over the fact that it was the police who attacked us on October 5th, and 50 years on they’re closing the bridge for us.”As the six make their way onto the middle of the bridge and take up their places, McKinney recalls the “enormous tension” before the march. “The expectation was that there would be a large number of people and that the police would stop it.”“We were scared,” says Canavan. “I remember the fear.”The leadership lined up at the front of the march, with substitutes ready and waiting behind them. “The idea was that everybody had a second and even a third,” explains Terry Doherty. “That’s why in the picture we’re lined up in rows behind them, so that if the front row got arrested the second row could just take their place.”Doherty was to stand in for Paddy “Bogside” Doherty, who had taken charge of the marchers behind them.“I was supposed to be going back and forth to tell Paddy Bogside what was happening,” says Doherty. “We had 20,000 people behind us all wanting to go somewhere, and he was standing on top of a car keeping everyone calm.”As the head of the march crossed the bridge, the photograph was taken. Ahead of them – just out of shot – was the police barricade.Canavan, McClenaghan and others “broke” the barricade. “I remember going over it and I actually fell over and I was picked up by a cop,” remembers McClenaghan.The barricade was more symbolic than practical, says Ó Dochartaigh. In the event, the marchers were able to simply walk around it, a solution which McKinney believes suited the police. “The numbers defied them, and they had been told not to challenge the march. People were able to just walk the barrier.”“I remember I found this staircase down from the bridge, and I told everyone to get to the Diamond by whatever route they could,” adds Canavan.Situated inside the city walls, the Diamond was both the geographic centre of the city and, to unionists, its symbolic heart its breaching, by the marchers, was equally significant. “We had 20,000 people in the Diamond, inside the walled city,” says Canavan.“It was just a moment in time,” says McKinney. “The mass impetus of such a massive number of people, you knew things were never going to be the same again.”He was right. Within a week, Northern Ireland’s prime minister Terence O’Neill would announce a programme of reforms which conceded a number of the demands of the civil rights movement, including the introduction of a points system for the allocation of housing, an end to discrimination in employment and a review of the voting system.As Canavan would later write in his report on the DCAC’s activities: “October 5th is but six short weeks ago and on Saturday last those few in number had become thousands strong and the might that humbled them lay outmanoeuvred, defeated and disgraced before the world.”The reforms were “a direct consequence of the march”, says McKinney. The key, in his view, is that those present came from all backgrounds and sections of the community. “20,000 peaceful people made a powerful statement.”McClenaghan agrees. “The most significant thing was the numbers. I think it was the biggest march that had ever happened in Derry, and it showed the strength of the civil rights movement.“The numbers gave it an authenticity, and I do think it empowered people. It influenced all sorts of movements – the women’s movement, the gay rights movement – because it gave people a sense of what they could do if they got together.”Fifty years on, the former marchers are together again. As they stand on the bridge, they remember that day, and those that followed. Once again, a photograph is taken.As the Sunday morning traffic resumes, they make their way back to the pavement and bid each other farewell.Canavan shakes hands, his eyes sparkling. “That was such fun,” he says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3700532.1542398453!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ulster unionist party slates brash behaviour by taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUlster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann: “The DUP were asleep at the wheel.”  File photograph: Peter MorrisonPA Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann has warned that the Government “should be careful what it wishes for” in relation to the proposed Brexit deal.Mr Swann, who is to speak at the Fine Gael Ardfheis in Dublin on Saturday, said his party is opposed to the draft withdrawal deal.He was also withering about the DUP.“Despite repeated warnings to tone down the language and act like good neighbours, the brash behaviour of the Irish Government led by Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney may yet lead to a place where none of us want to go,” he said on Friday night. “A no-deal Brexit isn’t in anyone’s interests. But if they continue to pursue an aggressive stance in future negotiations, they will continue to raise the hackles of even the most mild mannered of unionists across the United Kingdom,” he added. “For us, the union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland comes first.” Mr Swann described the agreement as an inevitable consequence of the British government and the DUP allowing a backstop inclusion in last December’s EU-UK agreement. The backstop was a “monumental error of judgment”, he said. “We cannot and will not support the withdrawal agreement because it will be a long-term challenge to the integrity of the United Kingdom. In the unlikely event that the agreement makes its way through parliament, its impact will be felt for decades to come.” He added that “the impact may not necessarily happen immediately. But as the months and years pass, the implementation of the disastrous backstop will see Northern Ireland potentially drift farther away from the rest of the United Kingdom unless action is taken to reverse its effects.” Mr Swann said the backstop would act as an incentive for Scottish Nationalists to use “every excuse under the sun to destabilise another part of the United Kingdom”.The UUP leader said that last year the party warned that the backstop would be a “millstone around the neck of the United Kingdom”. The backstop is designed as an insurance trade arrangement to avoid a hard border in Ireland, “But our warnings were ignored at that time by both the (British) government along with their DUP partners,” he continued.He accused the DUP of failing in its “primary duty to protect the integrity of the Union and its people. “The DUP were asleep at the wheel,” said Mr Swann. “They bear enormous responsibility for what has happened. They either misused whatever influence they had or were so full of their own hubris, that they didn’t see what was coming down the tracks.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

And I think when you look at those options, this deal starts to look a lot more attractive.”Later Taoiseach Leo Varadkar welcomed Fine Gael delegates to the convention centre at Citywest, where 2,500 delegates are expected to attend on Saturday.

The draft Brexit agreement includes a Gibraltar-specific protocol creating several working groups between Madrid and London. File photograph: Reuters As the UK’s exit from the EU wreaks havoc within the country’s government and leaves the bloc fretting over whether a deal will even be possible, one member nation already believes it is benefitting from Brexit. The negotiations have allowed Spain to make what it sees as crucial progress on the status of Gibraltar, the tiny territory on the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula that belongs to the UK. Spain has long disputed sovereignty of the Rock, which has a population of around 30,000.When Brexit talks began, Spain managed to ensure that any deal affecting Gibraltar would require its approval. Since then, Madrid and London have been holding negotiations in parallel to the main Brexit discussions on several issues, including Gibraltar’s anomalous tax status, which has been irksome for Madrid, and tobacco, whose low prices in the territory make it attractive to smugglers.The draft Brexit agreement includes a Gibraltar-specific protocol creating several working groups between Madrid and London, at least until the UK’s transition period ends in December 2020. The work of those groups will include cooperation on the environment and protecting the rights of the 10,000 Spanish workers who enter Gibraltar each day from the nearby area, where unemployment is high and economic opportunities relatively scarce.Although the withdrawal document does not lay out resolutions for the tax and tobacco issues, it does lay down guidelines encouraging Gibraltar to align itself with international standards regarding fraud and smuggling.“In the context of the overall negotiations for the withdrawal agreement and everything related to the Irish border, the Gibraltar issue has been relatively straightforward,” said Salvador Llaudes, an analyst at the Real Elcano Institute.\u0026nbspThe protocol contained within the Brexit accord, he said, “deals with the most important issues, in the short term, to protect the bilateral relationship between Spain and the UK, but also the day-to-day relationship between Gibraltar and the area of Spain immediately surrounding it”.The shared management of Gibraltar airport, which had been seen as a Spanish objective, is not broached in the withdrawal agreement. Also, Spain has not used the leverage afforded by Brexit to advance its sovereignty claims over the Rock, which has been British since 1713.El Mundo newspaper reported that Spain had “failed to capitalise on its unprecedented negotiating position”. However, the secretary of state for the EU, Marco Aguiriano, said that Spain plans to broach the issue of shared sovereignty in the longer term.Fears that Spain might use a British exit from the EU to boost its claim on Gibraltar helped sway voters in the territory in the 2016 Brexit referendum. With the Gibraltarian economy also heavily dependent on business with EU member states, 96 percent of the Rock’s residents voted to remain."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3700242.1542387898!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit deal varadkar signals very little wriggle room","story":"British Prime Minister Theresa May repeatedly refused on Friday (November 16) to rule out allowing her senior ministers to get a so called free vote, which allows lawmakers to vote against the wishes of their party, on the draft Brexit deal. LBC\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar: “If you start trying to amend it or unpick it you might find that the whole thing starts to unravel.” Photograph: Nick BradshawTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said there is “not much room for renegotiation” of the Brexit deal.Mr Varadkar also said it will be “very difficult” to avoid a hard border if there is no withdrawal deal in place when the UK leaves the EU next March.“If you start trying to amend it or unpick it you might find that the whole thing unravels,” Mr Varadkar said of the withdrawal agreement struck this week. However, UK prime minister Theresa May faces a struggle to get the deal through the House of Commons.Mr Varadkar said it will be difficult to avoid a hard border if no exit arrangement is in place when Brexit takes effect. It is the first time the Taoiseach has effectively acknowledged border infrastructure could return.“I think in a no deal scenario it would be very difficult to avoid a hard border,” he said. “As Ireland remaining part of the European Union, we would no doubt be required to implement European law and the United Kingdom, having left the European Union, would seek to join the World Trade Organisation and they would have to implement World Trade Organisation rules.”The Taoiseach was speaking at a housing launch in Dublin on Friday.“So those hard Brexiteers who say that somehow just through good political will you can avoid a hard border, that doesn’t make sense. Are they really saying that they would join the WTO and the first thing they would do would be to refuse to implement the WTO rules?“Are they really saying to us that we would stay in the European Union and not protect the single market? The only way we can avoid a hard border is by an agreement, an agreement that covers customs and regulations. We have that now.”Meanwhile, Mrs May has appointed Stephen Barclay, a pro-Brexit health minister, as her new Brexit secretary.He replaces Dominic Raab, who resigned on Thursday in protest at the Brexit deal. But Mrs May will take charge of Brexit talks, stripping the Brexit department of the role entirely.The Government declined to comment on UK media reports that a group of pro-Brexit ministers in Mrs May’s Cabinet are planning to meet in the coming days to renegotiate the mechanism by which the UK could exit the fall-back “backstop” option to avoid a hard border post-Brexit.UK environment minister Michael Gove along with other anti-EU ministers – trade secretary Liam Fox, international development secretary Penny Mordaunt, transport secretary Chris Grayling and leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom – were reported to be convening a meeting next week to discuss concerns over Mrs May’s deal. The cabinet approved the draft agreement after a five-hour meeting on Wednesday.The Government spokesman noted the Taoiseach’s support for Mrs May on Wednesday night when Mr Varadkar said people have consistently underestimated her mettle and courage.Pro-Leave cabinet members have met in the past to discuss their concerns about a proposed deal with the EU. Preparations for the meeting were reported by multiple UK news outlets, including the BBC, the  and Bloomberg.Irish Government sources said the UK ministers were contesting something that the cabinet had already approved.“This is something that we kind of expected,” said an Irish official. “They have to work it out internally over there. The agreement is done. The cabinet signed off on it. Whatever internal politics has to play out, we are going to let that play out.”Pro-Brexit supporters within Mrs May’s Cabinet and the Conservative Party object to the EU having a veto over the UK in any review of the backstop or any British push to exit the mechanism.Dominic Raab, who resigned as UK Brexit secretary over the withdrawal deal, had demanded the right for the UK to withdraw unilaterally from the backstop. But the EU and Irish Government rejected this.The final draft withdrawal agreement, approved by EU and UK negotiators, included a mechanism where a joint committee comprising EU and UK officials and co-chaired by both sides, would decide jointly whether the backstop, in whole or in part, was no longer necessary.The agreement says that the committee may, while deciding on a request to end the backstop from either side, may seek an opinion from institutions created under the 1998 Belfast Agreement.Earlier, Mr Gove insisted he still has confidence in the prime minister after deciding he will stay in her cabinet. His expression of support comes as former home secretary Amber Rudd is set for a return to cabinet as work and pensions chief, according to Sunday Times reporter Tim Shipman.Ms Rudd would succeed Esther McVey who resigned on Thursday. Ms Rudd resigned last April over the mistreatment of the Windrush migrants, or rather a false statement about the policy behind it.Following the resignation of four ministers in the wake of her poorly-received Brexit deal on Thursday, speculation was rife that the departure of the most senior Leave campaigner in her cabinet could deal a damaging blow to the prime minister.But Mrs May faces mounting pressure from within Tory ranks as further MPs called for her to be ousted.Mr Gove was asked if he had confidence in the prime minister and replied: “I absolutely do. I am looking forward to continuing to work with all colleagues in government and in parliament to get the best future for Britain.”Mr Gove would appear to have thrown a lifeline to Mrs May by staying in government.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The play, originally drafted in 1605, was not performed during George III’s reign because it was regarded as insulting.The revelation that the then 51-year-old king was “maddened” by the plot, which sees Lear ide his kingdom according to the flattery his three daughters bestowed on him, is at odds with the 1994 film of Alan Bennett’s play, the Madness of King George, which suggests the ruler was temporarily cured after reading a moving passage from the play.Mark Gatiss, who is currently playing George III in a revival of the play at Nottingham Playhouse recently revealed how he had drawn on his experiences growing up opposite a psychiatric hospital in County Durham to prepare for the role.Mark Gatiss as George IIIAccording to the papers released by the Royal Archives - the first royal medical records ever to be published - George III suffered significant periods of ill health during his 60-year reign from 1760 to 1820 which were largely misunderstood and treated with “remedies” such as purging, bleeding, blistering and even doses of opium.Changes in the King’s manner and health during 1788-89 - when parliament tried to establish a regency because of his behaviour - were documented in a diary kept by his Equerry, Robert Fulke Greville. In an entry from October 1788, he notes that “His Majesty had become more peevish than he used to be” and is agitated and talking incessantly and incoherently.  By December, the King’s health has worsened and a physician, Dr Francis Willis, who has experience of dealing with mentally ill patients, is summoned. Later that month, on 20 December, the King’s condition has deteriorated still: “H.M became so ungovernable that recourse was had to the strait waistcoat: His legs were tied, \u0026amp he was secured down across his Breast, \u0026amp in this melancholy situation he was, when I came to make my morning Enquiries.”Throughout George III’s illness, the Prince of Wales (latterly the Prince Regent and then George IV), received regular letters from his father’s physicians. In one, dated 18 December 1788, Sir Lucas Pepys informs the Prince of a deterioration in his father’s health, which he attributes to the King’s reading of Shakespeare: “This morning he is in nearly the same state he was in the evening, but is more agitated and confused, perhaps from having been permitted to read King Lear.”Letter from Sir Lucas Pepys to the Prince of Wales, 18 December 1788, citing King Lear as a reason for George III\u0026#39s \u0026#34madness\u0026#34 By March 1789, the King had recovered but he suffered further spells of ill health in 1801 and 1804, before the final, long period of illness from 1810 until his death in 1820.A volume entitled “The Progress of the Symptoms of the King’s Illness since November 1810” provides a daily account of the King’s wellbeing and highlights the close monitoring he was subject to.  The entry for 21 March 1811 states: “There is a nervousness and anxiety to be declared well and a distrust of the physicians. Slept four hours. Occupied when awake in adjusting the bedclothes, by rolling them down and up again. Did not talk much but twice betrayed delusion.”The regular reports to the Prince of Wales continued until the King died, aged 81. The final letter sent that day, signed by four physicians Henry Halford, Matthew Bailie, Robert Willis and David Dundas, states:  “His Majesty\u0027s pulse is still regular, but very feeble, and we cannot conceal from Your Royal Highness our fears that His Majesty may not be spared to us much longer.”The documents were released as part of the Georgian Papers Programme, which is transforming access to over 350,000 papers in the Royal Archives and Royal Library relating to the Georgian period.Donald Trump brags about answering Mueller probe questionsYemen\u0026#39s warring parties agree to meet in Sweden as Britain tests Saudi resolve at UNJapan Airlines tightens alcohol rules for pilots after Heathrow arrestCIA concludes Saudi Crown Prince ordered murder of journalist Jamal KhashoggiRecord 2 million cars have had their mileage clocked Theresa May pays tribute her \u0026#39rock\u0026#39 Philip as she says Canada plus trade deal is not possibleBrexit deal latest: Theresa May appoints Stephen Barclay as Brexit Secretary as Amber Rudd returns to CabinetBoys left to fail at school because attempts to help them earn wrath of feminists, says ex-Ucas chief Comment: Michael Gove cannot seriously think he can make Theresa May change course nowNicola Sturgeon and her Brexit minister accused of \u0026#39dereliction of duty\u0026#39 after rejecting deal meetingComment: Theresa May will not shift from her unworkable plan, so our only option is a new leaderMichael Gove leading Cabinet \u0026#39gang of five\u0026#39 with plan to force Theresa May into last-minute Brexit changesColonel accused of \u0026#39groping woman\u0026#39s breasts\u0026#39 at regimental dinner suspended by the ArmyLetter signed by hundreds of business leaders urges Tory MPs to vote down Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal Elvis Presley awarded US Medal of Freedom by Donald TrumpTheresa May\u0026#39s critics on the attack as no-confidence letters pile up, but whips launch a counter-offensiveMigrants pile into dinghies to cross Channel to Dover as \u0026#39panic setting in\u0026#39 before Brexit deadline hitsComment: This Brexit deal isn\u0026#39t a disaster, but only if Mrs May resignsCivil and family courts to trial flexible working hoursIs this the end of the road for the French rural mayor?Theresa May compared to Neville Chamberlain and told to resign during phone-in with publicWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"international hotel chains apologise unhygienic practices","story":"High-end hotels in China run by international chains Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt have issued apologies after a video went viral, showing unhygienic practices, including one cleaner who used the same sponge to wipe drinking cups and a toilet.The 11-minute video, claims it shows hidden camera footage of cleaning staff wiping cups and sinks down with used towels and other unsanitary behaviours at 14 international hotels in China. Since it was posted by a blogger using the pseudonym, Huazong, the video has been shared widely and watched nearly 30 million times.One online user wrote, “I always thought five-star hotels would be much better I never expected this to be the case.”Some hotels pictured that later issued apologies included the Le Royal Meridian Shanghai and two Sheraton hotels in other Chinese cities, all operated by Marriott, as well as the Waldorf Astoria in Shanghai, one of the Hilton hotel brands. Other hotels whose cleaners were caught on camera and also issued statements included the Park Hyatt hotel in Beijing, and the Shangri-La Hotel in Fuzhou in eastern China. Many of them have said they’re investigating.City tourism and health agencies in Beijing and Shanghai are investigating and in touch with the hotels featured in the video.Raising and enforcing such standards is an uphill battle at Chinese hotels given low wages and worker shortages. Still, the government has been eager to boost the country’s tourism industry to find another avenue for growth in efforts to shift the economy away from manufacturing and exports, and toward services industries.Hidden camera videos of poor practices by cleaning staff in Chinese hotels surface every so often on social media. Last year, another video went viral with the results of an investigation by an independent testing team that found many luxury hotels brands including the Intercontinental and the JW Marriott didn’t change the sheets and towels between guests.Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump brags about answering Mueller probe questionsYemen\u0026#39s warring parties agree to meet in Sweden as Britain tests Saudi resolve at UNJapan Airlines tightens alcohol rules for pilots after Heathrow arrestCIA concludes Saudi Crown Prince ordered murder of journalist Jamal KhashoggiRecord 2 million cars have had their mileage clocked Theresa May pays tribute her \u0026#39rock\u0026#39 Philip as she says Canada plus trade deal is not possibleBrexit deal latest: Theresa May appoints Stephen Barclay as Brexit Secretary as Amber Rudd returns to CabinetBoys left to fail at school because attempts to help them earn wrath of feminists, says ex-Ucas chief Comment: Michael Gove cannot seriously think he can make Theresa May change course nowNicola Sturgeon and her Brexit minister accused of \u0026#39dereliction of duty\u0026#39 after rejecting deal meetingComment: Theresa May will not shift from her unworkable plan, so our only option is a new leaderMichael Gove leading Cabinet \u0026#39gang of five\u0026#39 with plan to force Theresa May into last-minute Brexit changesColonel accused of \u0026#39groping woman\u0026#39s breasts\u0026#39 at regimental dinner suspended by the ArmyLetter signed by hundreds of business leaders urges Tory MPs to vote down Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal George III\u0026#39s medical records put online in royal first, revealing reading King Lear worsened his madnessElvis Presley awarded US Medal of Freedom by Donald TrumpTheresa May\u0026#39s critics on the attack as no-confidence letters pile up, but whips launch a counter-offensiveMigrants pile into dinghies to cross Channel to Dover as \u0026#39panic setting in\u0026#39 before Brexit deadline hitsComment: This Brexit deal isn\u0026#39t a disaster, but only if Mrs May resignsCivil and family courts to trial flexible working hoursIs this the end of the road for the French rural mayor?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 16 november 2018","story":"The original torch of the Statue of Liberty rests on a hydraulically stabilised transporter in New York.

Pressed into a field in Hampshire, it seemed to mirror the look of the original Arecibo message, which gave a host of information about life on Earth that the originators hoped would be decodable to people anywhere in the universe.Where the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage had shown blocks of information including depictions of important chemicals like carbon, an illustration of DNA and a picture of a human being. The hoax reply was probably too perfect: carbon was swapped for silicon, the DNA was altered and the human being was replaced with a big-headed alien of the kind seen in science fiction.Arecibo Message anniversary honoured in Google DoodleIt was of course a hoax: among other questions, sceptics wondered why aliens wouldn\u0027t simply have sent a radio message, as we did, rather than dropping down to Earth to press a picture of themselves into crops and then failing to actually alert anyone. But it was a demonstration of the way the original Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage and the search for alien life that it grew out of continues to occupy the minds of people around the world.Scientists don\u0027t ever expect to actually receive a reply to the Arecibo message: it was powerful but specific, pointed at a galaxy cluster that will actually have moved out of the way by the time it travels the 20,000 light years to its destination. It was probably most useful as a demonstration of the technology and a thought experiment that led people to think about what such a message might actually need to say.Similar efforts have been launched that could have more positive results, however. A new initiative called Breakthrough Message – part of a broader group supported by a Russian billionaire and Stephen Hawking, which aims to find life elsewhere in the universe – has invited people to consider how best to write and send a message out into space, though has cautioned that for the moment it will not send out those messages.But some fear that a response wouldn\u0027t come in the form of a message at all. Instead, it would be something altogether more dangerous – and that\u0027s why they advise that we shouldn\u0027t send further signals like the Arecibo message, for fear that they would only put us in peril.Stephen Hawking, for instance, famously said that we should be wary of sending out messages into the universe for fear that they could be answered by someone looking to wipe us out – or, perhaps worse, someone who might wipe us out purely by accident. ‘If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans, he said in a 2010 documentary.And such criticism was even in place when the Arecibo\u0026nbspmessage was first sent. Just days after the dispatch was shot into space, the Royal Astronomer of England,\u0026nbspMartin Ryle, launched an intense blast of criticism at the idea, arguing that it might only alert aliens who are malevolent or hungry, and asking the\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union to ban any future messages.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

By mid-December, one bitcoin was worth close to $20,000 (£15,000), but that was the high water mark before the tide turned.A year later, bitcoin is trading at around a third of its peak value but some cryptocurrency analysts believe the market might be on the verge of mirroring the gains it experienced in late 2017. The only caveat is that it might not be bitcoin that leads the charge this time.Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who was behind the online retail giant becoming\u0026nbspone of the first places to accept bitcoin back in 2014, said\u0026nbspthat he still expects\u0026nbspthe mass adoption of cryptocurrency, without specifying\u0026nbspwhich one.Speaking to bitcoin enthusiast Naomi Brockwell on her YouTube channel, Mr Byrne said he remained highly sceptical of the traditional financial system. When asked if he saw bitcoin becoming a worldwide currency, he pointed to countries like Venezuela that have experienced significant financial turmoil in recent years.When people start getting into it is when their own financial systems collapse, he said. Whether bitcoin is the one, whether bitcoin has solved its speed problem, or it\u0027s another cryptocurrency, only time will tell.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearBitcoin has enjoyed the most sustained period of stability in its history, helping it address the issue of price volatility that some critics say makes it unsuitable as a form of mainstream payment.\u0026nbspGeneral consensus among market analysts is that this trend is likely to continue in the short term, barring any major news that could send the price shooting in either direction, such as a large-scale hack on a leading exchange, or positive regulation implemented by a financial body.Bitcoin price predictions made by 10 analysts for November\u0027s Finder\u0026nbspCryptocurrency Predictions Survey suggest that the world\u0027s leading digital currency will experience steady growth over the next year, though the upcoming months remain uncertain.Bitcoin wallet give away $125m of cryptocurrency to help growth“Some of our panellists believe external forces could shift the market greatly over the next month, and particularly for bitcoin, Jon Ostler, CEO of Finder, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe upcoming decisions on a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund being approved or not by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) deciding whether to accept the application by ICE backed cryptocurrency exchange, Bakkt, are expected before 1 December. So at this stage, it’s difficult to predict exactly what will happen.Looking longer term, Mr Ostler said bitcoin is expected to experience steady growth over the next year, with the panel of experts predicting an average\u0026nbspvalue of $16,732 by the end of 2019. “With bitcoin being very stable and within a range between $6,800 and $6,100, it is hard to suggest anything will change until it breaks this range, said cryptocurrency trader Craig Cobb, who forms part of the panel.leveled out in recent months (CoinMarketCap)But if it\u0027s not bitcoin, a\u0026nbsphint at what this next break-out cryptocurrency might be was given earlier this week by Blockchain, the world\u0027s most popular bitcoin wallet.

We voted to leave and this proposal regains as much control as we can expect whilst still keeping us open for business with our biggest trading partner. Moreover, it delivers a clear path ahead that business so desperately needs.”Business groups welcomed the agreement as progress but the Institute of Directors (IOD) said more detail was needed for firms to assess how they will be impacted.IOD director general Stephen Martin urged ministers to think “long and hard” about how they react to the first-stage agreement.“Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal,” he said.\u0026nbspThe IOD was “heartened” to see that provision had been made to extend the transition period, Mr Martin said. An extension would help to ensure firms have enough time to adjust to any new changes once the UK’s economic relationship with the EU had been agreed.But growing unrest in Westminster has made the prospect of the current deal passing through parliament appear remote.\u0026nbspTwo cabinet members, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, resigned on Thursday saying they could not support the draft agreement.

Shares in the French car manufacturer\u0026nbsprose as much as 2.4 per cent to €20.25 (£19), outpacing gains of 1.1 per cent for rival Renault.Manufacturers including Airbus have warned for months that they will be forced to pull resources if Brexit leads to border delays, tariffs, or added paperwork that will drive up costs. Theresa May’s plan to ease some of those concerns is on the ropes, leaving her government in crisis and the deal with the EU in limbo with the 29 March orce creeping nearer.As May vowed to see her plan through, Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East called for a pragmatic approach that allowed some disagreements, with any deal being better than none, he told BBC radio.While few have given details, companies have stepped up contingency planning as the odds rise of the UK\u0026nbspcrashing out of the EU with no deal.BMW chief executive\u0026nbspHarald Krueger said last month at the Paris Motor Show that the car manufacturer, which builds Minis at its Oxford plant in Oxfordshire,\u0026nbspmay have to move production to the Netherlands. Philips has been warning since July that it would do the same with its baby products factory in Glemsford.UK car manufacturing falls again as industry demands Brexit safeguardNo UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsOpel-Vauxhall reports first profit in almost two decadesVauxhall under criminal investigation after cars burst into flamesVauxhall making new investment in Luton despite Brexit uncertaintyVauxhall ‘could shut dealerships’, threatening thousands of jobs “The political situation remains uncertain,” BMW said in an email late Thursday. “As a responsible employer, we must therefore continue to prepare for the worst-case scenario, which is what a no-deal Brexit would represent.”Paris-based PSA employs about 3,000 people in the UK, mainly at plants in Ellesmere Port, where it builds the Astra model south of Liverpool, and Luton which turns out medium-size vans.Brexit, along with a drop in diesel’s popularity, has already hurt UK\u0026nbspcar sales this year. New car registrations are down 7.2 per cent, according to the industry group SMMT. Vauxhall’s have declined 11 per cent, while the Peugeot brand is off 2.8 per cent and Citroen has dropped 3.6 per cent.Earlier this year, PSA announced plans to build a new model of the Vivaro van in Luton and increase production in 2019 with a €100m\u0026nbspinvestment. PSA has announced 650 job cuts at Ellesmere Port since it bought the brand from General Motors\u0026nbsplast year.About 80 per cent of the cars made in the UK\u0026nbspare exported, with half of those going to the EU, according to the SMMT. The UK\u0026nbspaccounts for about 10 per cent of PSA’s global unit sales.Carmakers also import parts and components, which would be vulnerable to any border delays or tariffs. Only 40 per cent of Vauxhall’s Vivaro van components, for example, are produced in the UK, according to a spokesperson. That figure is about 23 per cent for the popular Astra.If there’s no deal, “my responsibility will be to protect my company,” PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares said in Paris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They also discern that the most likely future path is for the UK to stay in the EU customs union. This is because:It will be guaranteed to do\u0026nbspso during the transition periodThe transition period could easily be extendedIt will be impossible for the UK to leave the customs union without the EU’s acquiescence andThe indications from leaked Brussels documents are that the EU sees UK membership of the customs union as the central feature of the future trading relationship.For 29 months, those in business have sought clarity and found only fog. For now, and despite every sign that the deal will be rejected by the Commons (at least initially) they are urging its acceptance – if only as the classic lesser of two evils.Mike Hawes, head\u0026nbspof the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders – representing millions of jobs and major UK export sector – was typical of many when he said: “For the automotive industry, Brexit is about damage limitation. The outline agreement is a positive step in avoiding the devastating consequences of no deal and securing a transition period.”The CBI echoed that view, saying: “This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transition period as a step back from the cliff edge.”The business world has for the most part\u0026nbsptried throughout the Brexit process to be as apolitical as possible. One of the more outspoken companies is Young’s, the pub firm, which said: “We have got as much as we can from a business perspective, and we need politicians to support this.”Markets believe that if there is a hard Brexit after all, the hit to the UK economy will be so bad it would need substantial devaluation of the poundThat provides an interesting counterpoint to the vocal pro-Brexit boss of Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, whose objections to the EU’s protectionism are well-known. Small business too has usually been more ided than big business, though in Northern Ireland, understandably, there is near unanimous support for the no hard-border deal secured by the government.The verdict of investors can be read more easily in the pound’s value, share prices and trading volumes than in press releases. As political backing for the Brexit deal started to unravel this week a familiar pattern re-emerged, reversing the upswing we had seen when it seemed there was solid cabinet support.\u0026nbspShares sank in companies that relied heavily on the UK market – housebuilders and banks for example – while those that are global and whose earnings are mostly non-sterling enjoyed a boost (because their euro, yen and dollar profits would buy more pounds when they are “brought home”). Markets believe that if there is a hard Brexit after all, the hit to the UK economy would be so bad it would need substantial devaluation of the pound to make UK exports\u0026nbspcheaper and overcome tariff disadvantages.There is a wider question, too, about the Brexit debate, which was colourfully summed up when Boris Johnson, when still foreign secretary, was reported as saying “f***\u0026nbspbusiness” in an overheated exchange. In other words, whatever the CBI wants is not necessarily the best for the UK economy as a whole.Thus, the Brexit debate can be seen as an argument between the producer interest\u0026nbsp– big business – and the consumer interest\u0026nbsp– families. The EU, through tariffs and other barriers,\u0026nbspprotects its\u0026nbspbusiness,\u0026nbspespecially farming, from global competition. The bloc\u0026nbspprovides a supply of cheap labour and makes food, clothing and many manufactured goods more expensive than they need be. For the public, yes, jobs would be lost in the short term in a hard Brexit, but there would be gains as the budgets of lower-income families would go further in the shops.\u0026nbspSo, just as in the referendum two years ago, business is mostly hostile to Brexit, as well as frustrated about the continuing uncertainties. Even now, business leaders have no clear idea about what the business environment will be like after 11pm on 29 March\u0026nbsp2019.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We voted to leave and this proposal regains as much control as we can expect whilst still keeping us open for business with our biggest trading partner. Moreover, it delivers a clear path ahead that business so desperately needs.”Business groups welcomed the agreement as progress but the Institute of Directors (IOD) said more detail was needed for firms to assess how they will be impacted.IOD director general Stephen Martin urged ministers to think “long and hard” about how they react to the first-stage agreement.“Leaving the EU without a deal is a very bad outcome for businesses, workers and consumers, and this is simply an inherent risk that comes with voting down any withdrawal deal,” he said.\u0026nbspThe IOD was “heartened” to see that provision had been made to extend the transition period, Mr Martin said. An extension would help to ensure firms have enough time to adjust to any new changes once the UK’s economic relationship with the EU had been agreed.But growing unrest in Westminster has made the prospect of the current deal passing through parliament appear remote.\u0026nbspTwo cabinet members, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, resigned on Thursday saying they could not support the draft agreement.

Shares in the French car manufacturer\u0026nbsprose as much as 2.4 per cent to €20.25 (£19), outpacing gains of 1.1 per cent for rival Renault.Manufacturers including Airbus have warned for months that they will be forced to pull resources if Brexit leads to border delays, tariffs, or added paperwork that will drive up costs. Theresa May’s plan to ease some of those concerns is on the ropes, leaving her government in crisis and the deal with the EU in limbo with the 29 March orce creeping nearer.As May vowed to see her plan through, Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East called for a pragmatic approach that allowed some disagreements, with any deal being better than none, he told BBC radio.While few have given details, companies have stepped up contingency planning as the odds rise of the UK\u0026nbspcrashing out of the EU with no deal.BMW chief executive\u0026nbspHarald Krueger said last month at the Paris Motor Show that the car manufacturer, which builds Minis at its Oxford plant in Oxfordshire,\u0026nbspmay have to move production to the Netherlands.

New car registrations are down 7.2 per cent, according to the industry group SMMT. Vauxhall’s have declined 11 per cent, while the Peugeot brand is off 2.8 per cent and Citroen has dropped 3.6 per cent.Earlier this year, PSA announced plans to build a new model of the Vivaro van in Luton and increase production in 2019 with a €100m\u0026nbspinvestment. PSA has announced 650 job cuts at Ellesmere Port since it bought the brand from General Motors\u0026nbsplast year.About 80 per cent of the cars made in the UK\u0026nbspare exported, with half of those going to the EU, according to the SMMT. The UK\u0026nbspaccounts for about 10 per cent of PSA’s global unit sales.Carmakers also import parts and components, which would be vulnerable to any border delays or tariffs. Only 40 per cent of Vauxhall’s Vivaro van components, for example, are produced in the UK, according to a spokesperson. That figure is about 23 per cent for the popular Astra.If there’s no deal, “my responsibility will be to protect my company,” PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares said in Paris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Covering the central events of her life from childhood to middle age, the biopic captured the defiant, uncompromising character of its subject, as expressed by her signature song “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien”.The directorial debut of Anton Corbijn, who had photographed Joy Division in their prime, Control married the British kitchen sink realism of the 1960s with the doom-laden atmosphere of Ingmar Bergman to appropriately eerie effect.

James Moore considers whether there is any room for social responsibility in the corporate world, or if we should just ditch the spiel on valuesClick to followThe IndependentBusinesses are stakeholders in society, and vice versa“These guys are mad. Call off the invasion. Their system’s going to eat them so we won’t have to. They have these company things that they’re allowing to bust the whole place up. Let’s just sit tight and clean up once they’re done wrecking it.”That’s what an alien might very well say upon looking at the way the titans of the capitalist system have been operating.\u0026nbspYou want examples? Ten years on from the financial crisis that caused a brutal recession and a lost economic decade from which we have still to fully recover and it isn’t hard to find people who’ll tell you that the banks could easily do it again.Tech giants make money from people taking out ads that are designed to corrupt democratic elections, while other companies wreck the environment.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the carnival of corporate scandal adds a new float every few months. Yet according to the Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, whose influence permeates through the Anglo-Saxon capitalist world, they’re all only doing what they’re supposed to do: increasing profits by whatever means necessary within the law.\u0026nbspIn his seminal work Capitalism and Freedom,\u0026nbspFriedman baldly stated that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits”.\u0026nbspHe had no truck with companies having any regard for\u0026nbspthe societies in which they operate, much less furthering socially useful goals such as\u0026nbsp“providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers”.\u0026nbsp“Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades,” he opined.\u0026nbspThat view is at odds with what you’ll often hear from modern executives, who like to talk about how important the “values” of the businesses they run are\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspbig up their role as “good corporate citizens”.\u0026nbspFacebook isn’t about making money. It exists to “connect people”. “Don’t be evil”\u0026nbspfamously used to be at the centre of Google’s corporate philosophy until it was quietly removed.\u0026nbspNow it says: “The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put Google’s values into practice. It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct.”Isn’t that nice? Milton must be turning in his grave. You hear similar things on this side of the Atlantic. I once suggested to a very senior executive at a rather famous FTSE 100 company over dinner that his talk about values was basically window dressing, and that cash was king. He became visibly upset.\u0026nbspYet Friedman would have found nothing to take issue with in the investor presentations put out by the aforementioned executive’s employer.\u0026nbspHe might have found today’s fiction of corporate social responsibility frustrating, even infuriating, but he wouldn’t need to scratch too far below the surface to be reassured.The Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real\u0026nbspwages\u0026nbspin the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago. Only those at the very top have made real gainsThe majority of western companies and western executives subscribe to and live by his doctrine in nearly every respect, even if they’re sometimes reluctant to admit it.\u0026nbspThat shouldn’t surprise anyone. They are legally required to do so.\u0026nbspBritain’s Companies Act of 2006 –\u0026nbsppassed by a Labour government by the way –\u0026nbsphas the fiduciary duty of directors to shareholders at its core.It states that a director must act “in the way he (sic) considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole”.\u0026nbspIn the case of big public companies, the members are shareholders, who invest in them, as Friedman stated, for the purpose of making money.\u0026nbspCapitalism red in tooth and claw rules, say his fanboys, because it has proved far better at delivering prosperity to those living under it than any of the alternatives (Friedman was writing at a time when the main one was Soviet-style communism).\u0026nbspSo, you corporate executives, it’s time to bin all that fluff about values. Go get yourself some CREAM (Cash Rules Everything Around Me, with apologies to the Wu-Tang Clan).\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe trouble with that view is it isn’t working so well any more, at least not for the masses, which might explain why extremists of one sort or another are finding such favour, extremists who are mostly bad for business – and yes that includes those on the right, in case you hadn’t noticed Donald Trump’s trade war.\u0026nbspThe Pew Research Centre recently pointed out that today real wages in the US, adjusting for inflation, have about the same purchasing power as they did 40 years ago.\u0026nbspOnly those at the very top have made real gains. Since 2000 their real wages have risen by a cumulative 15.7 per cent, to $2,112 (£1,628) a week – nearly five times the usual weekly earnings of the bottom tenth ($426).\u0026nbspReal wages for the average American worker actually peaked 45 years ago, a couple of years after Friedman published a piece expounding on his profits argument in The New York Times Magazine.\u0026nbspSimilar issues are at work in the UK labour market. Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, a job site, recently noted that average pay is still below its 2008 pre-crisis peak.“If real wages had continued growing at their pre-crisis trend, the average person would now be earning £130 more per week than they actually do,” he said.\u0026nbspIn the boardroom it’s a different story. In a 2015 report, the High Pay Centre noted that CEOs in the UK had seen their pay increase by a factor of five since the late 1990s\u0026nbsp– despite no evidence that this resulted in better corporate performance, productivity or economic performance.\u0026nbspThe latter point was eloquently made by Charles Cotton, senior performance and reward advisor at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and\u0026nbspDevelopment, during a hearing of the parliamentary business committee in June.\u0026nbspYet despite the occasional shareholder rebellion, there is scant sign of any real slowdown. A more recent report by the centre found that CEO pay leapt by 11 per cent in 2017, more than four times the pace at which the average worker’s pay increased.\u0026nbspFriedman argued\u0026nbspthat a corporate executive has direct responsibility to his employers “to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Mark Zuckerberg meets world leaders – in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.President Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingPresident Barack Obama talks with Zuckerberg during a town hall style meeting at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 20 April 2011David Cameron talks to the Facebook founder during the internet session of the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy meet Zuckerberg at the G8 summit in Deauville, France, 26 May 2011Zuckerberg talks to Sarkozy at a G8 summit in Deauville, France, 25 May 2011Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets the Facebook CEO at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 30 April 2015Zuckerberg with former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Tokyo, 29 March 2012Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Zuckerberg at a townhall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, 27 September 2015Zuckerberg with other business leaders and the Chinese President Xi JinpingBut, while they conform to that for the most part, when it comes to the question of their pay –\u0026nbspthey clearly break the rule. They and the non-executive directors who set it frequently act in ways that are ultimately opposed to shareholders interests.\u0026nbspThe situation reached its nadir in the UK with Persimmon Homes and its potential payment of £600m, slated to be shared among just over 130 executives. CEO Jeff Fairburn was due to receive more than £100m through it, although a public furore eventually saw him agreeing to reduce it to £75m.\u0026nbspThe company had been successful on his watch, it’s true, but that success was largely fuelled by the government-funded help to buy scheme, which underwrites mortgages for the first-time buyers Persimmon targets.\u0026nbspIt thus owed much of its success to a de facto public subsidy.\u0026nbspThe chair, and the chair of the remuneration committee who resigned in the midst of the scandal, admitted that the bonus scheme should have been capped, but this was too late to save the shareholders they were supposed to represent, who ended up handing over nearly 10 per cent of their company to its executives. No wonder one commentator referred to it as an act of “corporate looting”.\u0026nbspFiduciary duty? Forget about it!\u0026nbspPart of the reason for the repeated occurrence of this sort of thing is the way the modern company has become, in effect, ownerless – widely held by erse groups of institutional investment funds which buy and sell electronically, rarely vote on company resolutions and sometimes may only be on the shareholder register for a matter of days, even hours.\u0026nbspRemuneration committees would have you believe that they seek to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, despite their lack of oversight, by making them shareholders too. CREAM for all!Facebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to comeThe problem with that analysis is executives get their shares for free, and if something is free you don’t really value it. They rarely put their own money at risk. Perish the thought.\u0026nbspThis too often leads to them throwing caution to the wind in pursuit of potentially huge payouts. Why not?If their employer fails really badly, keels over and dies halfway down the track from an overenthusiastic application of the whip, they may lose their jobs. But corporate executives are rarely out of work for long.\u0026nbspTake a look at the career of Andy Hornby, as an example. The HBOS CEO had his hand on the tiller when the bank fell off a cliff, and the government had to step in and find a rescuer (Lloyds) which it then had to bail out.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspHornby, who was sharply criticised in a report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, ought to have been unemployable after that. But it wasn’t long before he found a new role as the chief executive of Alliance Boots, before moving on to bookmaker Coral.\u0026nbsp​RBS’s Fred Goodwin wasn’t so lucky thanks to his status as the bogeyman of British banking. But nearly all of his boardroom colleagues had secured alternative work within a couple of years of that bank’s collapse. One wonders what will now happen to those who spent time in the Carillion boardroom. Its executives also went for the bonus long shot jackpot. Expansion and profits uber alles, until the roulette wheel threw up a double zero.There was no bailout in that case, but the taxpayer was nonetheless left with a hefty bill in the wake of yet another glaring example of the capitalism Friedman advocated eating itself. But there are some companies that have eschewed Friedman’s ideas in another, more laudable respect, and with intriguing results.I’m not talking here about the corporate social responsibility\u0026nbspprogrammes most big businesses like to run. They’re often little more than extensions of the marketing budget, designed to send a message to consumers: “Hey you lot, come spend with us. You can feel good about it because even though we screw up the environment, look we’ve built a well in Senegal and we let our people go and help inner-city kids in their lunch hours.”I am instead thinking of those businesses that have actively sought to promote ersity (a favourite of the current crop of reformers) through their hiring\u0026nbsppractices.\u0026nbspFar from suffering through doing so, they have benefited, and handsomely.\u0026nbspMcKinsey, a management consultant renowned for its hard-headed intellectual rigour, sought to study the impact on the\u0026nbspcorporate profitability of hiring both more women and more staff from a minority ethnic background.\u0026nbspIts report –\u0026nbspDelivering Through Diversity –\u0026nbspshows that companies that do this make more money.\u0026nbspThe firm examined 1,000 companies from 12 countries for the 2017 study.\u0026nbspThose with workforces in the top 25 per cent for ethnic ersity were 33 per cent more likely to see higher than average profits than those in the lowest. When it came to gender ersity the figure was 21 per cent.\u0026nbspThe findings particularly stressed the importance of these groups being hired to both management roles (where they are often hardest to find) and in revenue-generating “line”\u0026nbsppositions from where executives are typically drawn.\u0026nbspCompanies that do so comply with Friedman’s demands that they maximise profits by taking his prescription and doing the opposite. \u0026nbspBut the question of whether the “profit at all costs” aim isn’t still destructive remains.\u0026nbspPutting profits first has left Britain with water companies that impose hosepipe bans while gallons upon gallons of water pours into its streets from leaking pipes.\u0026nbspIt has produced the railway debacles that have shattered the faith of the public in privatisation.\u0026nbspIt was for the purposes of bringing in a few extra dollars that Facebook allowed itself to be used by those seeking to influence the US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.All these demonstrate how self-defeating corporate behaviour that puts profits above society can be. The water industry is now dealing with tougher regulation, while the government is poised to announce a review into how rail services are delivered.\u0026nbspIf Labour comes to power both industries face nationalisation, an idea that is finding increasing favour with the public.\u0026nbspFacebook has had its reputation trashed, and paid fines, while also dealing with new rules. There might be worse to come. There probably should be.\u0026nbspWould all this have happened were these businesses to have taken their “social responsibilities” more seriously?It\u0027s not just in the field of hiring that companies would benefit from thinking a little more carefully about what they do and how they do it.\u0026nbspEco-friendly buildings? That’s your energy bill down.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutesAct to cut emissions and curb other environmentally damaging behaviours? The costs of environmental destruction could be reduced, resulting in, for example, lower insurance premiums.\u0026nbspSocially responsible businesses could serve to benefit shareholders, at least those with a time horizon beyond five minutes.\u0026nbspIt’s worth considering the experience of Nationwide and John Lewis, one a member-owned mutual, the other an employee-owned partnership, at this point.\u0026nbspThey aren’t without their failings. Nationwide, for example, is as guilty of overpaying its executives as some banks.But as a rule, they manage to balance both long-term financial success, something their owners are still interested in, with a more enlightened stance towards the society they operate within than some of their peers.John Lewis’s constitution is a particularly worthy example. It sets out employee partners’ rights and responsibilities and defines “how power is shared and our collective responsibilities to others”.Mutuals and partnerships fail just as public companies do. But as often as not it is when they follow the destructive playbook of the latter, with too little oversight brought to bear on over-powerful and overpaid executives seeking to maximise profits above all else and taking silly risks to do so. \u0026nbspPerhaps it’s time to consider a revised Companies Act to better balance shareholders’ interests with those of other stakeholders. A very senior Tory, from the party’s sane (non-Brexiteer) wing, pooh-poohed this notion in conversation with me. They argued that an employee, for example, could never be ranked alongside the shareholder owner. But why not? As I’ve tried to demonstrate, it might ultimately work in their favour.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis, where the employees are the owners, hasn’t been immune from the challenges afflicting the high street. But most of its stock market-listed department store rivals would kill to be in the position it is in.\u0026nbspWorks councils are commonplace in Europe, as is employee representation on boards, something Theresa May briefly talked about before beating a hasty retreat. \u0026nbspJohn Lewis chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield to step down in 2020Diversity makes companies richer says McKinsey. Investors take noteIt is true that they haven’t necessarily\u0026nbspserved to curtail executives’ worst instincts –\u0026nbspit isn’t hard to find examples of excessive pay at German companies for example. But look at Germany\u0026nbspand look at Britain and ask yourself which has the better way of doing things. Would anyone other than a die-hard nationalist say anything other than “Vorsprung Durch Technik”?\u0026nbspBritain, and other western nations, have also given businesses responsibility for functions they never had when Friedman was writing.\u0026nbspSo, yes, society does have a big stake in how they are run, and governed. It is high time that was recognised. Society needs seats on the board, a place in the constitution,\u0026nbspa role in corporate thinking. So do workers.\u0026nbspWhen Tony Blair coined the phrase “stakeholder” it was widely criticised as a buzzword (he was rather fond of them).\u0026nbspBut businesses are stakeholders in society, just as society is a stakeholder in businesses.\u0026nbspThe betterment of one\u0026nbspfavours the other, not least because, as that McKinsey study shows, more society can ultimately lead to more money. More CREAM for everyone.It’s time for us to recognise that and to start looking at ways of reforming the system. It really isn’t serving us very well.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It failed to see it – but that failure puts a limit on how big the rock can be, since if it was large enough it would have been spotted, according to a new paper published in\u0026nbspthe Astronomical Journal and coauthored by scientists at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.Asteroid could have been spacecraft sailing past us, say scientistsThat helps to lead credence to the theory that the relatively small object is being pushed along by gas that was being thrown out of the object. That gave the effect of adding thrust as it travelled through the solar system, speeding it up.It was that strange speeding up behaviour that led scientists to suggest that it could be an alien probe, sent past Earth by a distant civilisation. The extra propulsion could be caused by the object working as a lightsail, designed to be carried along by solar radiation, Harvard scientists recently suggested.The alternative and more accepted theory of frozen gases inside the object being expelled and pushing it along was dependent on Oumuamua\u0026nbspbeing smaller than typical comets inside of our solar system. With the determination that it probably is, the research seems to suggest theories about it being an alien spacecraft are less likely.Oumuamua has been full of surprises from day one, so we were eager to see what Spitzer might show, said David Trilling, lead author on the new study and a professor of astronomy at Northern Arizona University. The fact that Oumuamua was too small for Spitzer to detect is actually a very valuable result.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightSocial jet lag is a new phenomenon where people shift their sleeping patterns backwards and forwards during weekends and holidays. It is thought to be exaggerated by disruptive things like phones and social networks that encourage people to stay up and follow the news, and\u0026nbspit is thought to affect a vast proportion of the population.Usually, people are forced to wake up much earlier than their biological clock would suggest, as they get up for work. At the weekends, people will often move back again, going to sleep later and making up for it with lie-ins in the morning.This is the reason you\u0027re not sleeping wellNow a new study has found that appears to be causing social jet lag, where people are disrupting their sleep pattern between the week and the weekend.The new research came from a study that looked at\u0026nbspthe Twitter activity of more than 246,000 users from 2012 to 2013. Those tweets were tagged with geographical location, allowing researchers to use them to understand when people were going to sleep and waking up.It found that people across the US seemed to sleep in and tweet later during times that saw large amounts of holidays. Previously, scientists had suspected that social jet lag might change with the seasons and the amount of daylight – and while it does differ through the year, that appears to be more a consequence of the way people\u0027s social schedules change, rather than anything seasonal in itself.We started the study expecting it to be a solar or seasonal effect – that your internal clock will shift in the summer and that will lead to decreases in social jet lag, said Aaron Dinner, professor of chemistry and one of the study\u0027s senior authors. But in fact, that\u0027s not what we found at all. People get up later on weekdays in the summer because their social constraints are relaxed. Weekend behaviour – and presumably a person\u0027s biological clock – does not change much over the year in most counties.The researchers also found that the data about sleep correlated with obesity rates: places that tweeted until later also saw higher rates of obesity. They also correlated with sleep data taken from more traditional studies.I was impressed that so much could be learned from this purely public data set that was not at all intended to tell you about sleep, said Michael Rust, associate professor of molecular genetics, cell biology and physics and the study\u0027s other senior author. In fact, we could rediscover things like the correlation with obesity or levels of social jet lag based on time zone that were found in other studies where people designed surveys to ask about sleep directly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I would be knocking things over on shelves and walking sideways to accommodate both of us.”The 24-year-old had formed a close bond with his horse, and the pair made headlines after being pictured strolling through Northallerton in February.It had been hoped Digby – who initially stood at 29 inches – would become Mr Patel’s full-time guide following a two-year long training programme. But concerns were raised when Digby grew by four inches over the summer.Now Mr Patel, who works as a planning producer with the BBC and lives in Blackburn, has been to the US to source another companion.He said: “It’s not a case of Digby is not suitable for just me, he has sadly grown to 33 inches. As a guide horse he would not have a future fulfilling the role properly because of his size… It’s nobody’s fault but that did mean my visions to have Digby by my side long-term are not going to come to fruition anymore.“If I had not gone to the US it would have been a setback. I don’t see it as a setback, I’m still going to get a guide horse and it’s still going to be the same time frame.“If it was the case that he was the only candidate it would have been a setback. I saw four guide horses while I was in the US, all of them were between 27 and 29 inches.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environment Secretary Michael Gove speaking outside the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs offices.

He tweeted that the position was ”a poisoned chalice”, before claiming that the government was “unlikely to survive until Christmas”.Labour’s shadow minister for the cabinet office Jon Trickett said Theresa May\u0027s decision to appoint Ms Rudd, who was forced to step down as home secretary over the Windrush scandal only months ago, was a desperate choice.“After enforcing Theresa May’s hostile environment in the Home Office, Amber Rudd will now be in charge of the DWP’s hostile environment for disabled people and the poorest in society, he said.\u0026nbsp“With Universal Credit in absolute shambles, appointing a disgraced former minister who was only recently forced to resign for her role in another scandal is a desperate choice by a weak prime minister.”Universal credit replaces six existing benefits – employment support allowance, income support, income-based jobseeker’s allowance, housing benefit, working tax credit and child tax credit – with a single payment.A National Audit Office report released in June found food bank use in Ms Rudd’s constituency,\u0026nbspHastings, had risen by 80 per cent since UC was rolled out there.The\u0026nbsprollout\u0026nbspof UC\u0026nbspstarted with new recipients in pilot areas in 2013, but the scheme has been plagued by delays and it is now\u0026nbspnot due for completion until 2023.Created with Sketch.

Another insider told The Independent others were more focussed on achieving a stronger settlement in the “future framework” – outlining the UK’s final post-Brexit trading relations with the EU – which is still to be hammered out ahead the special EU summit on 25 November.Created with Sketch.

But he added:\u0026nbsp“Nothing is agreed, until everything is agreed.”The EU have been less equivocal, with German chancellor Angela Merkel saying there is “no question” of reopening talks as a document is now “on the table”.Ms Rudd’s return to the cabinet is a boost for Ms May, given that she has backed the current form of the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement.After her new job as work and pensions secretary was announced, Ms Rudd told Emma Barnett on BBC Radio 5 Live: “It is quite exciting this proposal, and I certainly hope the cabinet back it.\u0026nbsp“I think it’s the right combination. It’s a compromise. Everybody knew it was going to have be a compromise, and the people who are throwing mud at it from either side are looking for something perfect.“Perfect was never going to be on offer.”Earlier in the day Eurosceptic MP Steve Baker sought to pressure cabinet members by warning that any who backed Ms May’s approach could forget about becoming party leader – with Mr Gove, Ms Mordaunt, Mr Hunt and Mr Javid\u0026nbspbelieved to harbour ambitions.But a push from Mr Baker and other members of the\u0026nbspEuropean Research Group (ERG) of backbenches to secure a vote of no confidence in the prime minister appeared to have some way to go, with the MP making differing statements during the day on how many letters had been submitted – 48 are needed from MPs to trigger a vote.Tory whips held a meeting on Friday ahead of a potential challenge, while Ms May conducted a conference call with Tory association chairs as she tried to build support for her Brexit deal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For these reasons I cannot support the proposed agreement in parliament and would hope that Conservative MPs would do likewise.”The cabinet’s backing, however, means the EU are set to give the green light to a\u0026nbspEuropean Council\u0026nbspsummit at the end of November, which if successful could see a vote on the draft deal in the house of commons in early December.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So I hope that this can be such a basis.\u0026nbspFox admits ‘a deal is better than no deal’ as he backs May’s BrexitEU leaders ‘could be willing’ to renegotiate Brexit, Sturgeon insistsTheresa May calls Brexit press conference amid bid to unseat herMay braced for more cabinet resignations after day of Brexit chaos“The worst case, and most disorderly, is that there is no kind of no deal.”It comes as Westminster waits with baited breath to see whether the prime minister will be subject to a no-confidence vote over the plan. This would be triggered if 48 Tory MPs write to party authorities requesting one, a number that is thought to be close.In Brussels, ambassadors of the 27 remaining EU member states are meeting to put the finishing touches to the “future relationship” part of the deal, which unlike the withdrawal agreement could still change.An account of one meeting on Friday reported by the BBC says EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier paid tribute to Ms May’s conduct in talks, but that he warned the EU should not compromise its principles even if there is a difficult situation in the UK.\u0026nbspHe is said to have warned that even though the UK wants to avoid a no-deal, it should not engage in bargaining – echoing a message similar to that stated by the German chancellor in public.Ambassadors are set to meet again on Sunday ahead of a meeting of EU\u0026nbspministers on Monday, which will make preparations of the planned Brexit summit on the 25 November where the deal will hopefully be finalised.Created with Sketch.

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future.

This is our number one spending priority and we have already committed to spending more money on the NHS over the next five years.“It will mean £394 million more a week going into the NHS.”However, the PM repeatedly refused to condemn former foreign secretary Boris Johnson for campaigning for Brexit in front of the bus that bore the £350m claim.The prime minister was also subjected to repeated calls to stand down, to\u0026nbspmake way for Brexit-supporting politicians, told the Conservative Party’s coalition partners the DUP would withdraw support unless there was a change of leader, and she was compared to former prime minister Neville Chamberlain, who attempted to make peace with Nazi Germany ahead of the Second World War.In the lengthy appearance, Ms May defended her plan, admitted there had been compromises, but maintained her belief the plan was the best deal for the UK.One Conservative-supporting councillor Dan, from Louth, said Ms May should stand down, saying he commended the PM for trying to strike a Brexit deal with the EU, but sadly that has not worked.He said: “Please Prime Minister, tell me why do you think you should stay on as PM when you have failed - despite your no doubt honourable intentions - to (deliver on) the referendum result?If you cannot do that, I respectfully ask you to do the right thing in the national interest and stand down to allow someone from the Brexit camp to take the lead. There is still time to sort this out.Ms May responded by going through details of the draft withdrawal agreement.She said: “You\u0027re absolutely right that for a lot of people who voted Leave, what they wanted to do was make sure that decisions on things like who can come into this country would be taken by us here in the UK, and not by Brussels, and that\u0027s exactly what the deal I\u0027ve negotiated delivers.”During her half-hour appearance on the show, host Nick Ferrari also told the prime minister DUP leader Arlene Foster had said the party was “ready to withdraw support unless there was a change of prime minister”.“They’ve raised some questions with us, they’ve raised some concerns with us”, Ms May conceded, and added she believed she still had the DUP’s support for the Brexit deal.Agencies contributed to this reportThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They become the first Khmer Rouge leaders to be held to account by an international court for a campaign of genocide against the Vietnamese and Cham minorities in Cambodia in the 1970s.The court found Khieu Samphan not guilty of genocide against the Cham, for lack of evidence, though he was found guilty of genocide against the Vietnamese under the principle of joint command responsibility.From Newcastle and New Zealand to the Killing Fields of CambodiaThe\u0026nbspKhmer\u0026nbspRouge sought to achieve an agrarian utopia by emptying the cities to establish vast rural communes. Instead, their radical policies led to what has been termed “auto-genocide” through starvation, overwork and execution.The crimes against humanity convictions covered activities at work camps and cooperatives established by the\u0026nbspKhmer\u0026nbspRouge.These offences comprised murder, extermination, deportation, enslavement, imprisonment, torture, persecution on political, religious and racial grounds, attacks on human dignity, enforced disappearances, forced transfers, forced marriages and rape.The breaches of the Geneva Convention governing war crimes, included wilful killing, torture and inhumane treatment.Nuon Chea, 92, was brought by ambulance and Khieu Samphan by van from the nearby prison where they are held.Chea Sim: Politician who left the Khmer Rouge and became a key figureSecret Cambodia diary helped to convict two Khmer Rouge ringleadersHow the west is profiting from modern slaveryCambodian opposition leader released to near-house arrest conditionsSpoilt Cambodian ballot papers seen as protest over ‘sham’ electionLawyer for Cambodia tourists says they should be deported not jailedThe prison and the courthouse were custom-built for the use of the tribunal, which is officially called the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, or ECCC.Both defendants were present, as Judge Nil Nonn opened the proceedings, but Nuon Chea suffers heart problems, so was granted permission to later move from the hearing room to a separate holding room.Khieu Samphan, 87, was present for the entire hearing and with the help of two security guards stood as his sentence was read, showing no obvious emotion.A large crowd of spectators attended Friday’s session, including members of the Cham minority.Lah Sath, a 72-year-old Cham man from the eastern Kampong Cham province, brought his wife and four young granddaughters to Friday’s session.He said he often heard people talking about the trial and sometimes watched it on TV, but decided it was time to see it with his own eyes.Just talking about the Khmer Rouge brought back horrible memories of life during those years, he said.The Cham were treated as enemies and exploited without mercy as they were forced to do intensive farm labour, he recalled.Lah Sath said his younger brother was killed by Khmer Rouge for failing to take good care of a cow.In addition to Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, the tribunal has carried out one other prosecution, resulting in the 2010 conviction of Kaing Guek Eav – known as Duch – who, as head of the Khmer Rouge prison system, ran the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre in Phnom Penh.Additional reporting by APShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In that time, the monarchy\u0027s position within British society has changed dramatically and is almost unrecognisable to how it was seen in the 1950s. Alongside Prince Philip, she oversaw modernisation that thrust the Crown into the twentieth century \u0026ndash and her decision to welcome TV cameras in the 1960s was a major step in that direction.

Just days after Prime Minister Theresa May announced she had reached a landmark deal in Brexit negotiations, scientists have voiced their concerns the industry will suffer after the UK leaves the European Union. One of the main reasons for this is that as part of the negotiations, free movement around Europe for Britons and for EU members coming to the UK will be abolished, which will mean Britain will fail to land industry leaders from around the globe.

I sense, like the recently axed Big Brother and The X Factor, it’s been living off its reputation for a couple of years.Enjoyable as it’s been, the basic issue with this run has been the lack of a central figure in the mould of Syed Ahmed, Katie Hopkins or the late, great Stuart Baggs to take the series by the scruff of the neck.Some have shown vague promise but the closest thing it’s had to an alpha bell-end is Captain Pangea himself, Kurran Pooni, who was marked out less by his all-round uselessness than by the wrist he broke arm-wrestling back at the house, and his insistence he was “ per cent stepping up as project manager” just before he  per cent stepped down.There was no dodging the bullet, though, last week, when Lord Sugar demanded he PM a marketing campaign “for a noo airline” with accompanying adverts “and a noo unorm as well”.Kurran wasn’t underselling the sense of destiny he felt at this responsibility. “Everything in my le has led to this moment,” he claimed, presumably ’cos he hadn’t done anything  up until that moment.The great thing about this task, though — like all the best Apprentice episodes — was that the laughs were shared round equally.So while advert director Kurran was recreating the Club Tropicana video on Southend seafront, Camilla and Jackie were designing a stewardess’s unorm for the party-themed Jet Pop that wouldn’t see the light of day eveneasyJet suddenly opened a brothel chain in Amsterdam.A horrible thought occurred, though, as she was market-researching at Heathrow.She’s not going to wear that thing pitching to  industry experts at BA HQ, is she  She bloody is, you know.She gave it the full doors-to-manual flirtation as well. So everyone’s mind was already in the gutter before Jackie finished the audience off with the news: “It’s very easy to wipe down, as well.”In the normal course of events, reducing Claude Littner to a helpless giggling wreck would be enough to lose any task.The other team, though, Typhoon, had contrived to come up with something almost as bad, Manage Air, a business-targeted operation whose corporate logo looked like a satanic pentangle and theme tune was AC DC’s Highway To Hell.There was a genuine sense of tension in the boardroom then, which would’ve been ruinedSugar had played it all for laughs.He didn’t, though. He let the contestants hang themselves with their own words before firing Kurran, who could leave with a sense of “job done”.He’s created a bit of Apprentice folklore, after all, and hopefully reminded everyone this show is far from dead.Naturally, in the final taxi scene, he also remained convinced of his genius, boldly declaring: “My advert was gold.”The first and possibly last time in his le where he’s not just  per cent wrong, he’s  per cent right as well.Glorious television.Dianne: “Stephen Fry.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Sesame Street’s Big Bird lives in what street ”Oliver: “I don’t know.”Joe Lycett: “A bird in the hand is worth two in the what ”Jon: “Foot.”And Bradley Walsh: “Which former EastEnders star presents the Sky One series Extreme World ”Zoe: “Barbara Windsor.”CELEBRITY Hunted contestant and former Commando Johnny Mercer MP has faced a stark choice this past month.The eternal humiliation of being beaten by Chris and Kem, off Love Island, on the Channel  hide ’n’ seek game.Or two weeks in a confined space with a clearly smitten Kay Burley.Heroically, he chose the latter, enduring her attention and pet namewith the same sort of grit that probably saw him through three tours of Afghanistan.Then, last week, he sneaked off for an unscheduled visit to his we, Felicity, and Burley completely lost her s***.Lost it so badly, in fact, that she threw herself at the mercy of a passing bread truck driver, which led to the best update of the series: “Kay Burley is currently in a -ton lorry, on the M, between junction  and .”She was quickly grassed up, of course, then apprehended at the Warburton’s depot, without the need for a vet or a tranquilliser dart.But while it’s a poorer show without the old mad-whack, there’s still plenty of mileage left in this gripping series.AJ Pritchard is cornered in Shropshire, Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith has just been found hiding in his mate’s Jacuzzi showroomand Baldrick-brained duo Chris  Kemhave somehow given everyone the slip.But as for Johnny Mercer  He’s probably smuggling himself back to the Mouth of Hell fort, in southern Helmand, just for the relative peace and quiet. Paul Merson: “For me it’s six and a half of one and a dozen of the other.”Graeme Souness: “The only one with potential is Martial and Pogba.”Dion Dublin: “Liverpool are in second and a half gear.”And Charlie Nicholas: “Pogba’s either brilliant or a showpony. He played OK last week.”THIS week’s Doctor Who episode introduced us to the Demons Of The Punjab, who turned out to be nothing of the sort.They were just morbid sods who mope around the universe “honouring those who die alone”, like soldiers, holy men and Brendan O’Carroll on For Facts Sakes.No actual science-fiction storyline to speak of then.But that’s not really the point of this viewer-shedding series, which has already got on its high horse about sexism, Donald Trump, American segregationist racism, men giving birth and gun control.Kind of inevitable, then, that the BBC would eventually pour a bucket of its self-loathing sick all over the British Empire, via the partition of India in , with an episode that was every bit as historically powerful as Carry On Up The Khyber.The key dference, of course, was that Bungdit Din and his Burpers weren’t actually being used as a means of brainwashing children.Because If you were expecting Doctor Who to present the flip side of Britain’s relatively benign rule in India , then you’ll also be waiting for the episode where Jodie Whittaker lands in a Soviet gulag and starts teaching children about the brutal idiocy of Marxism.The BBC just doesn’t do anything other than its own left-of-centre view, these days – or irony by the sounds of things.As it’s just been revealed there’ll be no festive episode of Doctor Whobecause it’s “run out” of storylines.Run out  RUN OUT How the hell can a series run out of ideas when it hasn’t had any yet This Morning, Thursday: “Coming up, at quarter to , the rise of the penis filler, Doctor Ranj is here to answer your questions.”The show’s other penis filler, Martin Lewis, will answer them on Monday.IT seems almost wrong to single out just one programme from Sunday’s beautul Armistice Day coverage, but the year’s most meaningful TV awards should probably all go to BBC’s They Shall Not Grow Old, made by Peter Jackson, whose astonishing film gave a voice, laughter, tears and colour to some of the extraordinary men who survived the - trenches.Those of us who watched it, on Sunday, are unlikely ever to forget the experience. Those of you who didn’t, must catch up with it on the BBC iPlayer.Be sure, though, to watch it right through to the credits’ last chorus of Mademoiselle From Armentières, where it names the veterans who have all long since passed but whose memories and souls have never seemed more alive and unforgettable.“It’s quite hard to put your finger on it.”I’ll bet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit.

So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July.

He blasted ministers as in denial and dont see any problems.After taking a -day tour of the UK, the UN rep looked at Brexit, Universal Credit, cuts to local services and employment.But critics said he shouldnt be focusing on Britain - and should be looking at poverty in third world areas instead.The Australian professor went to Ireland in  too.Tory MPs insisted the plans were a waste of time and money because the UK is one of the richest countries in the world.But today he claimed that one FIFTH of Britain live in poverty - and .million are destitute and cannot afford basics.In a y report he concluded: British compassion for those who are suffering has been replaced by a punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous approach...As the country moves toward Brexit, the Government should adopt policies designed to ensure that the brunt of the resulting economic burden is not borne by its most vulnerable citizens.He was particularly damning about the new flagship benefits system, which roles six payments into one.It is fast falling into Universal Discredit, he said, saying the DWP were more interested in economic savings and sending messages about lestyles than genuinely helping people.Recipients are immediately plunged into further debt and inevitably struggle mightily to survive, he said.Many claimants also feel that they are forced to jump through hoops for the sake of it, fill out pointless job applications for positions that do not match their qualications, and take inappropriate low-paid, temporary work just to avoid debilitating sanctions.One Conservative Party MP with whom I spoke criticised DWP for adopting a military-style command and control approach.But the analysis was rejected by Conservative MPs.Philip Davies said: “If the UN are serious about tackling poverty they might want to go to the Third World. That would be a more valuable use of their time than coming here and grandstanding with some hard-left agenda.”Fellow Tory David Morris added: “Professor Alston has given no methodology to his conclusions. His job means he is permanently hunting on a poverty safari.”Hundreds of Brits have said they are struggling under the new system, and say they have been pushed in to debt for the long wait for payment. One in six Brits are still not getting their first benefits payment on time, new figures revealed this week.Mr Alston blasted the draconian sanctions regime for small errors and said the test and learn approach was treating vulnerable people like guinea pigs and wreak havoc in real peoples’ lives.The digital-focus of Universal Credit was a key part of that, he added, which fails highly vulnerable Brits.The hardest hit are women, children, people with disabilities and pensioners, Mr Alston said.John Dickie, the Director of the Child Poverty Action Groupin Scotland said today: The Rapporteur’s findings should be a wake-up call for government at every level.UK Ministers now need to wake up to the damage being wreaked and end the freeze on working age benefits, scrap the two child limit and fully restore the value of universal credit.But a Government spokesperson said: We completely disagree with this analysis. With this Government’s changes, household incomes have never been higher, income inequality has fallen, the number of children living in workless households is at a record low and there are now one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with .Universal Credit is supporting people into work faster, but we are listening to feedback and have made numerous improvements to the system including ensuring . million households will be up to £ better off a year as a result of raising the work allowance.We are absolutely committed to helping people improve their lives while providing the right support for those who need it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449958119.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"536ad worst year to live plague famine","story":"Hard professor Michael McCormick said AD is a prime candidate for the unfortunate accolade of the worst year in the whole of recorded history.At the start of that year, the Middle East, Europe and some parts of Asia faced  months of complete darkness caused by a mysterious fog.It caused snowfall in China, continental-scale crop failure, extreme drought, famine and disease throughout most of the northern hemisphere, reported Daily Mail.The harsh year was caused by a cataclysmic Icelandic eruption, according to scientists.Archaeologist and medieval historian Prof McCormick told Science Magazine the world isnt thought to have recovered until AD -

It’s one of the most important ways the solar cycle affects our planet,” explains Mlynczak.“We’re not there quite yet,” he said of the record cold, “but it could happen in a matter of months.The most famous example of a prolonged sunspot minimum is the Maunder Minimum, referring to a period around  to  during which sunspots become exceedingly rare.Maunder coincided with the middle part of the Little Ice Age, when Europe and North America experienced colder temperatures - fuelling speculation that the two were connected.However, the prevailing hypothesis for the cause of the Little Ice Age is that it was the result of volcanic action - meaning that a decline in solar activity was not the main cause."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449956868.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=720\" height=\"1280\" width=\"960","title":"worst conditions landlords feral tenants","story":"From a bath full of rubbish and an unknown black liquid, to festering toilets, peeling walls and junk-strewn gardens, homeowners have shared these snaps of the wreckage some renters have left behind.One picture shows a bathroom thick with layers of grime and paint peeling from its walls.Another image shows a kitchen stripped bare of any paint, wallpaper of flooring.The pictures have been shared with interior specialist Hillarys, which has launched a competition to find Britains worst tenants from hell.The company invited the nations landlords to upload photos of the worst conditions their tenants have left their homes in, with the most shocking in with a chance of winning £ - cash."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004483024602.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"spice girls tickets cardiff resale price","story":"The hotly-anticipated tickets in Cardf went on sale today at .am as Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Mel C and Mel B added an extra date to the tour.Viagogo – an online market place for ticket resale - is currently flogging premium seated tickets in for £, - almost  times the face value of £..And premium Spice Circle standing tickets will set fans back £ compared to the £ face value cost.On StubHub, tickets for seating are being flogged for £. - five times the £. face value.While the same website is flogging seats in the upper tier for £., which is also five times the face value cost.It comes after Sun Online revealed some resale sites for selling tickets to see the Spice Girls for up to £, just minutes after they were released on November .Viagogo was flogging a VIP ticket to the show for £, instead of the £, which is what it costs at face value.While seating tickets, which ranged from £- £ originally are selling from £ - £,.Spice Girls fans were left frustrated as they struggled to get tickets and noticed the extravagant prices on resale sites.One upset punter wrote: “Well I sincerely hope @spicegirls bring out more dates because that was a joke.

That is expected next week.The comeback of the Hastings MP was the most eye-catching move in a swt reshuffle forced on Mrs May after seven resignations in protest at her soft Brexit deal.She replaces Esther McVey, who quit on Thursday after a bitter row with the PM during a five-hour Cabinet meeting on Wednesday to sign off the draft EU plan.The other vacant Cabinet post of Brexit Secretary was filled by Stephen Barclay, who had been a mid-ranking health minister.Ms Rudd’s first act in office was to mount a stinging attack on Mrs May’s seething Brexiteer critics for navel-gazing.Calling on the plotters to think again, Ms Rudd said: “This is not a time for changing our leader, it is a time for pulling together to remember who we are here to serve.“I worry sometimes that my colleagues are too concerned about the Westminster bubble rather than keeping their eye on what our job is.”Extolling Mrs May’s virtues, Ms Rudd added: “I am confident the Prime Minister can survive — I think she’s demonstrated this week her complete commitment to making sure that she serves the people she was elected to do so.”The combative Cabinet minister also praised Mrs May’s Brexit deal as “a really practical response to leaving the European Union” and “the right combination”.Her rapidwas made possible by an official report last month into the Windrush scandal which cleared her of blame.Ms Rudd now faces the titanic task of completing the introduction of Universal Credit, the new all-in-one benefit beset by delays and controversies.Little-known former solicitor Mr Barclay, , is a Brexiteer and May loyalist, and replaces Dominic Raab.But the job in charge of the Department for Exiting the European Union will now only preside over Brexit’s domestic delivery and No Deal preparations.The PM took full charge of the last ten days of EU orce negotiations.Mr Barclay is a close friend of Mrs May’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell, so is “unlikely to resign in a huff like the previous incumbents”, one senior Tory said.Environment Secretary Michael Gove had been offered the top Brexit job by Mrs May on Thursday but turned it down when she refused to let him go back to Brussels to reopen negotiations.Her radio humiliation came as  Conservative MP Greg Hands commented that the PMs cricketing idol was once deliberately run out by a member of his own side - Ian Botham - for the good of the team.Mr Hands wrote on Twitter: Interesting passage from Leo McKinstrys biography of Geoff Boycott when the England team had to run out their own captain for the benefit of the team. England went on to win by  runs.The PM told LBC: The thing about Geoff Boycott is he was absolutely steady, he kept there at the crease, he carried on and relentlessly went about his goal, and I think thats important.But host Nick Ferrari pointed out the England legend had been run out by Jim Love of Yorkshire in his last match.When he quipped Michael Gove might do the same to her premiership, Mrs May hit back: “I think Michael Gove is Scottish.Two troublemakers for No were also brought back into the fold as Mrs May tried to build bridges.Remain-backing EU rebel Stephen Hammond was made a health minister and Brexiteer John Penrose a Northern Ireland minister.

That’s where they feel they can have real effect now.”But The Sun can also reveal that Mr Gove told the PM her soft Brexit deal will be rejected by the Commons in a crucial showdown meaningful vote next month when he turned down her offer of Brexit Secretary on Thursday.The Pizza Club could meet as early as Sunday.They are also reaching out to other Cabinet ministers who have expressed unhappiness as the PM’s vision of close alignment to the EU - Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Geoffrey Cox, and Sajid Javid.The Sun can reveal that Mr Gove’s former advisor and Leave campaign svengali Dominic Cummings went to his West London house on Thursday to heap pressure on him to resign.But another friend of Mr Gove’s said he felt he was “screwed either way”, as he didn’t want to be blamed by the party for bringing down Mrs May after kning Boris Johnson during the Tory leadership contest two years ago.Returning to work yesterday to reveal he was staying on, Mr Gove said he “absolutely” does still have confidence in Mrs May as leader.But he stopped short of publicly endorsing her Brexit deal.Signalling his plan, Mr Gove added: “I think it’s absolutely vital that we focus on getting the right deal in the future and making sure that in the areas that matter so much to the British people, we can get a good outcome”.Meanwhile Mrs May carried on with her desperate push to sell her Brexit deal to voters and MPs.Doing a breakfast show phone-in with LBC radio station on Friday, she insisted there were “areas where we said no, and held our ground, and the European Union has given in to us”.She added: “As you might recall, Ken Clarke did say I was a bloody dficult woman”.Liam Fox also issued his first words of backing for the PM after  hours of silence, insisting: “What we need now is stability”.But as the new boss of No Deal planning, he may have the most important job in Government.Onlywe’re ready for a clean break from Brussels is there a chance that the Prime Minister’s dodgy deal might be improved — and get through Parliament.Over the past two years of circuitous negotiations, the one lesson has been that the European Union understands only the most brutal, blunt language.British negotiators have tried the give-and-take compromise approach and the only result has been their pockets being turned out before they’ve got back on the Eurostar.We must now be clear that we are not just prepared to leave without a deal but will embrace doing so. That means Mr Barclay needs to get our ports, our airports, our security services and our customs authorities ready for March .Chancellor Philip Hammond must be clear, too, that he will use the £billion earmarked for the “orce bill” for a massive programme of infrastructure spending and tax cuts that will supercharge the economy. We must be bold.Theresa May has been clear that this is a “draft” deal. In truth Brussels will not change a single word unless we show them that we’re not scared of building a future outside the EU.The sorry deal we have is the direct result of unimaginative civil servants who viewed the vote to leave — the largest democratic mandate this country has ever seen — not as an opportunity to build a better future but as a damage-limitation exercise.It is telling that the PM, with remarkable resilience, has to do her own cheerleading. Where are all those in the Cabinet who back the deal  Why aren’t they on the TV and the radio It’s hard to shake the feeling that some still around the table are thinking too much about their career prospects at this vital time, hoping nobody will remember their silence.We hope the Brexiteers in the Cabinet, sidelined for too long, DO redraw this plan. They are, after all, now armed with the fact that as it stands it will struggle to get through Parliament. We hope that the Prime Minister WILL tell the EU they need to bend.But they will only listenwe ready ourselves to walk away and be ruthless.The PM’s unofficial deputy told the Cabinet this week not to get too hung up on the exit mechanism, that parliament could always find a way.It was pointed out that,needed, we could suspend the Ministerial Code and break international lawthe national interest required it.We shouldn’t take such a step lightly.But we are in extraordinary times, and perhaps only extraordinary action will do.Issuing an appeal to fellow Brexiteer Tory MPs to end their coup attempt on Mrs May, the Cabinet minister urged them to take “a rational and reasonable view” of the crisis.Dr Fox added: “We are not elected to do what we want. We are elected to do what’s in the national interest. Ultimately I hope that across Parliament we’ll recognise that a deal is better than no deal.”More than  business leaders have urged Tory MPs to vote down the draft Brexit plan. The group, including Wetherspoons’ Tim Martin, called it a “national humiliation”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There has been little preparation made for leaving without a deal, weakening the UK’s negotiating hand and sending a message to the EU that we’ll never walk away.She triggered Article  without knowing what she wanted, then wasted months and months of valuable negotiating time in internal discussions. She signed up to a joint report on the Irish border without telling her Cabinet how that would limit the UK’s options and end up shaping the entire negotiations.Even in recent weeks, she has made mistakes — making it patently obvious to the EU how much of a hurry she was in to get a deal and not letting her own Brexit Secretary seehe could winkle any concessions out of the EU. Given all this, it is not surprising that so many Brexiteers want to vote down her deal.But the question of how Mrs May has handled Brexit so far is NOT THE SAME as the issue of what Parliament should do given where we are now. There is ONLY ONE WAY for Mrs May to break this link.She should say that as soon as the withdrawal legislation is through the Commons, she will stand down as Prime Minister.  This would enable MPs to vote for the deal without that being an endorsement of her handling of Brexit or an invitation for her to negotiate the next stage of Brexit, the UK EU trade deal.One Cabinet minister tells me the PM is now an impediment to this deal passing. Her announcing her departure would make it easier for MPs to vote for the deal.Mrs May’s allies dismiss this idea out of hand. But she needs to do somethingshe is not to see her deal voted down, increasing — as she herself says — the chances of either no deal or no Brexit, both of which would be bad for the country.In Wednesday’s marathon Cabinet meeting, one of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox’s arguments for accepting the deal was that it would be possible for the UK to claw things back in the second half, the actual UK EU trade negotiations.But as any football fan will tell you, a team trailing badly at half-time doesn’t change things round by simply sending the same team in the same formation back on to the pitch.Would Liverpool have come back from - down to win the Champions League in they hadn’t changed anything at the interval  No.  If things really are to be dferent in the second half of these talks, then the UK will need new leadership.Now the problem is that some of these arrangements create an ongoing obligation under international law. So, getting out of all of them unilaterally would involve breaking international law. This would, arguably, be in breach of the ministerial code which requires them to “comply with the law”.But, I understand, it was pointed out at the meeting that the PMhas the power to suspend the ministerial code when necessary.This means the Government could simply get out of the backstop, then dare the EU to take it to court“LOYALTY is a two-way street,” one Cabinet minister told me after Dominic Raab resigned.

Michael Gove wouldn’t take the job because it came with no real power.Mrs May has appointed a new Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay. But No are saying he will only be responsible for no-deal planning and the Parliamentary side of the job. He won’t be negotiating.He will also, as a Brexiteer, be sent out to defend this deal. He will be a “flak jacket to go out on TV”, one Leaver tells me.SPECULATION is swirling in Westminster about whether Mrs May will face a vote of no confidence or not in the next week.Several Cabinet Ministers are resigned to a vote happening. Others worry that the vote is ill-timed, that in going for her now the plotters won’t win but will instead ensure she stays on as Prime Minister for another  months and takes charge of the UK EU trade negotiations.A minister complains: “If we strike and miss now, we’ll be shackled to a corpse for a year and Corbyn really will get in.” Butthe rebels do get their  letters, Mrs May might have a harder time in the confidence vote than expected – though she will still win it.Several ministers admit that, in the privacy of the ballot box, they will vote against her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yes, Jeremy Corbyn’s coat. Or as every right-wing bile-spiller called the raincoat he wore over his suit, on a rainy day, at the Cenotaph “a cheap and scruffy anorak which insulted our fallen heroes”. Well,Michael Foot can earn his stripes as a commie spy and a Remembrance Day tramp, why not Corbyn  The row rumbled on until Thursday when, despite the Tories cack-handedly ripping themselves to shreds and trying to drive the country they vow unending love to over the Dover clfs, a leading columnist in The Times penned a diatribe about the man in the “pound MS hooded raincoat”. As though most men in Britain would view a pound coat as cheap. Behind Corbyn at the Cenotaph, Tony Blair showed the way of a true patriot by wearing an expensive black, woollen coat which matched his expensive tan and sombre expression. That’s showing proper respect you see.  You may be directly responsible for sending hundreds of young men and women to their deaths in a futile, shyarguably illegal war, but at least you know what coat to wear when you’re remembering those pointless deaths. David Cameron was no slouching private either. He stood to attention beside Blair in a black Savile Row number, doing his country proud as he did when he marched us into battle against the Brexit he created, then deserted the second that battle was lost. Lest we forget. This brave chap has always known that it ain’t what principles you wear but the way that you wear them. It’s been bred into him. Remember when he told Corbyn in the Commons as he struggled to defend his party’s wilful destruction of the NHS: “My mother would say... put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem.”  It was the classic upper-class shypatrician retort when cornered. Look down on a man’s clothing and question his patriotism. But as Cameron’s party, like his country, now lies broken and humiliated thanks to him, who can he look down on  Whose patriotism can he question  With the layers of Brexit lies peeling away, the public anger towards the man who gambled all our futures in the arrogant belief he could solve the Tory right’s obsession with Europe, is mounting. Rarely is his name spoken without Danny Dyer’s accurate four-letter description of him thrown in.  Social media never tires of repeating shyCameron’s infamous tweet at the  General Election: “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong Government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” Even the usually mild-mannered Lord Melvyn Bragg has branded him “contemptible” and “a wimp” and asked “who the f*** does he think he is ” I think Cameron now knows who he is. Someone who believed he was born to achieve the impossible and be hailed the greatest Tory leader since Thatcher. But whose reckless vanity managed to achieve a dferent kind of impossible. Becoming the most despised Prime Minister since her. And I really hope, at the Cenotaph, that Tony Blair hugged him close to his black designer coat and thanked him from the bottom of his heart for that.

The wound has not healed. Every time we come together briefly, be it Royal weddings, bad weather, strikes or other reasons to rekindle the Blitz spirit, someone comes along to rip the sutures out. Any medic will tell you that an injury left untended for two years will attract flies and disease. The patient will pick at it, and people will be repelled by the odour. And so the schism in the British soul - and Brexit makes us all wonder what being British means, what it is for, andit will last longer than our letimes - has drawn opaquely-funded think tanks, millionaires of questionable finances, friends of Boris and organisms who would have long ago witheredthey did not have this flesh to feast on. John Redwood, a man we thought destroyed in  by his inability to sing the Welsh national anthem, lurched to le yesterday to claim Britain should ignore all legal obligations and debts owed to foreign states and spend the money on itself, with no thought for what that might mean for the debts we are owed by others. Alongside him were other backbench leforms often scratched at but rarely bothered with - Kate Hoey, Peter Bone, Andrew Bridgen, Dennis Skinner, Philip Davies. These are the ones who can be relied on to denounce pretty much anything.  Its the ones who think about what theyre doing, though, who are the biggest worry. Boris Johnson, who broods and plots and composes manestos that are all about Boris. Michael Gove, who wants the world to know hes spent  hours considering his position as though hes the real power behind any throne. And Jacob Rees-Mogg, who clutches his cufflinks while delivering the verdict of medieval autocracy on abortion, incest, and why the Irish need to be put in their place. They appear to actively seek a chaos which will destroy those poorer and less shouty than they are. These are the men who demanded a cake called Brexit, insisted the ingredients were available and method quite clear, but saw no need to check the cupboards or the cookbook. They tied the Prime Ministers hands, stuck a kne in her face and then demanded she ice it, too.  On the Opposition benches are  MPs supposed to offer an alternative to this Tory cannibalism but instead concentrating on how to get a Labour government. Plan A appears to be do nothing, which has the merit of not being dficult but has not, in the  years since they began it, achieved anything beyond nothing. All of these people are prepared to go on TV, into Prime Ministers Questions, and call press conferences to denounce, demand and decry a -page document many of them have not bothered to properly read. If they had, they would not act so surprised, as it is in essence the same draft agreement presented at Chequers four months ago. This threatens the union of our four nations! they complain. This is not what people voted for! BBC interpreter sums how the nation is feeling on Brexit Well, precisely. The fact Brexit heralds the break-up of the United Kingdom, renews the threat of terrorism in Northern Ireland and that the ballot paper was lacking in detail is sort of the problem.And of course this is not what people voted for - because THIS IS NOT THE DEAL. Its just a proposed agreement with the EU to allow us to talk about a deal for another decade, while pretending weve left the EU quicker than is logically possible. But these people who think carefully about their position, who take to the airwaves and send out their friends talking about vassal states and betrayals and a botched deal know this. They know its not the deal, they know it is temporary, and more importantly they know YOU didnt read the  pages either.And it is not as though, for all their talk of changing the Prime Minister, anyone  wants the job.  The Tories want to depose their leader, but have no one who wants to succeed her. They talk about letters that arent written and threats that are never fulfilled, and theyve been performing the same psychodrama for  years without ever once reaching the third act. Labour want to gain power because they believe theyre the good guys, but actually dont because they have no idea what to do about the Brexit cake someone  promised to bake. Corbyns current plan is to tell the EU, which is ready to negotiate a deal, that he doesnt want to, and go back and re-negotiate the transition instead. Meanwhile, the people are wondering where the cake is. They are told the recipes been botched, that the chefs hopeless, half the kitchen assistants have resigned, and the waiting staff are all militant communists. And theres an Irishman sitting in the corner getting angry. What should the British do, in such a restaurant  Half of us sit quietly and hope some sort of cake will arrive eventually, and that it wont kill us outright. And the other half huff, say they never wanted any bloody cake anyway, and vow never to be seduced by such offers again.  And nothings fixed. Families are arguing, the Tories are dying, Labour is withering, businesses are leaving, the pound is crashing. Theresa May has no power, but no escape route either - she has no choice but to limp on, like Jesus carrying his own cross to Caly, and will no doubt have to nail herself to it before anyone decides to end her misery. With her or without her, there is no Brexit agreement the Tories could agree on. There is no alternative Labour is prepared to offer. There is no way to overturn a democratic referendum, yet without a resolution it is inevitable this festering injury will kill us. Were like a couple whose most boring, habitual bicker has propelled them to the brink of orce, and are now wishing theyd never made such a thing of it. Whatever way we look, there is nothing but consequences. If we are to heal there is only one logical, British alternative. We must put politics, teams, tribes, Leave, Remain, his, hers, yours and mine, completely aside.  We need what we always do in times of crisis, a government of national unity to rule in Britains best interest, which is to never talk about any of this ever again. No-one gets to call anyone  a loser. Everyone can say they won. We just decide wed rather be together, and that were all going to be on our best behaviour from now on because harmony is not something to be reckless with. No-one voted to lose Northern Ireland. No-one voted for more Tory warfare. No-one wanted a useless Opposition, people resigning after not doing their job properly and blaming someone  for it, a female PM being beaten up every day by public schoolboys, or an EU that appeared to be more sane and reasonable than us. I love you. Lets never mention Brexit again.

By lunchtime, there’s already a buzz around the tiny Essex village. Unlike generations of politicians, a United Nations investigator, Philip Alston, is making time to visit during a tour of the UK to shyinvestigate the emergence of ‘extreme poverty’. Today, he delivered his report to a disintegrating UK government what he’s made of the harrowing stories he has been hearing across the country. I hope Alston told ministers about Rob, a nurse, who developed a serious health condition and found himself assessed by “people who barely have a health qualication” and was found ‘fit for work’. Have you got a personal story like this about austerity Britain  Email webnews@mirror  “In January I applied for ESA,” Rob told the UN man. “It took them seven weeks to tell me they had never received the form. I had to live on handouts. Going to a foodbank, it really does make you feel worthless.” And I hope Alston told them about a young disabled woman called Mollie who described “watching poverty crippling my mother”. And Rebecca who spoke about the “hostile environment” of zero-hours work. And a young woman called Raven who spoke up about “girls with toilet paper Sellotaped into their underwear” during their period. Jaywick, which regularly tops the list of ‘most deprived’ parts of the UK, is well used to being the poster child for poverty. A few days ago, a picture of one of its streets – Austin Avenue – was used on an attack advert by the Republican party in the United States. “They’ve no right,” Doris Telford, , a retired advocate for elderly people says. “They’ve never even been here.” Scott Michael, , nods. “We’re fed up of people saying we’re a shanty town,” he says. “We’re a community.”  A tenant of one of the houses in the picture asks not to be identied. “I didn’t have a choice about moving here,” she says. “The council moved me out of London because of the benefit cap. It’s a good enough place but the houses are falling down.” Built when motoring was in its infancy, Jaywick’s streets are named after cars, and the street plan was designed to look like a car grille. In the s, newly mobile families were able to get to the seaside at weekends, and a shyproperty developer had the idea of selling them land to build chalets on.  During the postwar housing crisis people started moving to Jaywick permanently. Now, decades on, many of these originally shytemporary homes are desperately patched up, or in dereliction, but local spirit remains strong. Even the village’s one pub is called the Never Say Die. Today, at the Community Centre, built on what was once the boating lake, most of Jaywick has squeezed in to see Mr Alston, the man from the UN, and to hear searing testimonies organised by Unite Community.  One man, called Steve, tells Alston he and his we had both been made redundant by the job centre. “The debts just kept racking up,” he says. “We were relying on foodbanks. We could just about afford to feed the kids, but we were missing meals. I felt I needed to provide, as a man, and I couldn’t do it. I didn’t realise how bad it had affected me. “In January , I contemplated taking my own le. I thought no one will miss me, I’m useless. I’m just going to end it.” When he tried to get help he was told he could only have telephone counselling. Another speaker, Trisha, tried to take her own le after getting pound, into debt. She’d worked her whole le for the NHS but left with spinal problems. Help from Christians Against Poverty made her realise “I’ve got a lot to live for and a lot to offer”.  But she adds: “Now, my area has gone to Universal Credit and I’m struggling again. All the clothes I’ve got on now are from the British Heart Foundation. I was six weeks with no money coming in, living off baked beans.” She finishes sadly: “It’s a lonely world out there.” Wheelchair-user Erin’s family went from “a comfortable middle-class two-income household” to near destitution after she had a brain haemorrhage.  The family have found themselves excluded from the rental market because of insidious ‘no DSS’ rules. “So I am to be made homeless,” Erin says. “I don’t where I am going to be putting our -year-old child to bed. This is the hostility faced by disabled people under austerity. We’ve even lost the very human right of a home.” Alston is clearly moved by what he’s heard, and he reassures people their testimonies “are not going to be for nothing”.  At the end of the meeting, in carefully chosen words, he echoes one of the final speakers. “Mike says that ‘Austerity is a political choice not an economic necessity’. That’s right. Poverty is a choice. You can choose not to make people poor.” Outside, night has fallen, and opposite the Community Centre the boarded-up Mermaid Inn and the derelict Dolphin Diner are a reminder of what Jaywick once was and could be again, given a fair chance. Today, the world will hear from Alston. How bitterly ironic that while he’s been here one of the politicians most responsible for these stories – Esther McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions – has resigned. Not from shame, but because she now hopes to become Prime Minister.

This is Steve Barclays biography, profile, voting record - and why you wont know who he isShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsStephen Barclay now has the unenviable job of planning for No Deal Brexit \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe UK has its third Brexit Secretary in a year and youve almost certainly never heard of him.Stephen Barclay was appointed by Theresa May after both previous holders of the job - David Davis and Dominic Raab - quit over her plans for Brexit .He will now have the job of planning for a disastrous No Deal BrexitTheresa Mays plan falls apart by  March . So who is he, and why is he someone almost no one will recognise  Heres a quick guide.  Stephen Barclay - who calls himself Steve - is the -year-old MP for North East Cambridgeshire. The former Axa insurance lawyer and dad-of-two was born in , the son of a union official and civil servant, and grew up with three brothers who all played rugby. He went to pound,-a-year King Edward VII school in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, and studied history at Cambridge. He spent his gap year in the army - serving with the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.In perhaps the greatest ever case of nominative determinism, he was also a director at Barclays Bankbefore he became an MP. After trying and failing to join Parliament twice, as far back as , he was finally selected for his safe seat and won in . He was promoted to a government whip under David Cameron in  before rattling through junior ministerial jobs - first at the Treasury, then at the Department of Health. This is his first Cabinet job.  The MP was one of a string of government ministers who publicly said they would campaign to leave the EU. He said of David Camerons deal to remain in : “The deal does not deliver the game changer we need to protect against further EU integration.” That means all three Brexit Secretaries have backed Leave - seen as an important trait to hold the role. But hes not exactly a tub-thumping backer - hes only mentioned the word Brexit in Parliament  times.  Theresa May did try to recruit a more high-profile minister to the role, but struggled - because it meant finding someone who would go out to bat for her Brexit plan. Michael Gove reportedly turned down the job after saying hed only take ithe could renegotiate the -page deal, which Brexiteers say locks the UK under Brussels rules. With  Cabinet ministers reportedly slamming the deal in private - two of whom resigned - the Prime Minister was not exactly spoilt for choice for a new Brexit Secretary. The Prime Ministers spokesman said Mr Barclay was The Prime Ministers choice for the job, but declined to say whether any other MPs were approached to fill the role. Theresa Mays Cabinet has signed off a -page draft Brexit deal with Brussels - and it has enraged Tories. Here are some of the reasons why:The transition period can be extended - and we dont know how long for Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK We need the EUs permission to quit the backstop European courts will still have a big hold on the UKFOR THE FULL GUIDE CLICK HERE Not as much as you might think. When Dominic Raab was hired earlier this year he was denied the job of actually negotiating the deal. Instead that was led by the Prime Minister herself and her chief civil servant on Brexit, Olly Robbins. What will happen is hell be left to pick up the pieces - quite literally. His job will include planning for No Deal.  Just months after the global financial crash, in February , he spoke out against new regulation of the City saying it would deter investment. He said those backing it were trying to deal with events that only happen once in a letime. He voted in favour of gay marriage in  and against a backbench Bill to legalise assisted dying in . He voted in favour of slashing disability benefit Employment and Support Allowance by pound a week in . He voted in favour of UK airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria in . And he backed the bedroom tax despite asking for pound,. in accommodation expenses, we reported in . Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces two more hurdles - an EU summit with  leaders on November , and then the vote in Parliament at some point before Christmas. MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions are explained more fully here. But or more vote against the deal, they will defeat the deal. Against the deal TORY BREXITEERS: There are up to  , led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. They will vote down a deal that keeps Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels. TORY HARD REMAINERS: Only about a dozen, but many - including Justine Greening and Jo Johnson - will vote against, instead wanting a second referendum. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They will vote down the dealit allows customs checks between Ulster and Britain. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. The party has confirmed theyll be told to vote against the deal because it doesnt meet Labours six tests. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Brexit.OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. For the deal TORY LOYALISTS: Well over  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. UnknownLABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against."},{"url":null,"title":"cage bed tragic toddler ellie","story":"NewsCage bed where tragic toddler Ellie-May was tied up and left to dieEllie-May Minshull Coyles leless body was found in her Frozen-themed bed, which had been made into a cage, at Lauren Coyle and Reece Hitchcotts flat in PrestonShareCommentsByElaine McCahill:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video pair-sentenced-following-caged-toddlers-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPictures have been released of the horric Frozen-themed cage bed where a toddler was tied face down and eventually died. Lauren Coyle and Reece Hitchcott, both , were found guilty of causing or allowing the death of -month-old Ellie-May Minshull Coyle following a trial, but cleared of her manslaughter. They were each sentenced to  years in prison at Liverpool Crown Court today. Photographs of the bed show slats and sides from her cot had been attached to it with towels and sheets draped over them so the child could not see or get out. The little girl had been forcibly tied to the bed on more than one occasion and restraint marks on her body showed she had had at least one wrist and one ankle tied.  A post-mortem examination found her death was caused by forcible restraint by ligatures in a face down position complicated by hyperthermia. The prosecution said the duvet placed over the tot would have impacted on her ability to control her body temperature, causing her immense suffering, distress and upset. At some point on March , , the little girl stopped breathing and her heart stopped. Coyles father, Sean Coyle, called round to the flat in Preston at sometime between  and .am that morning to check on his daughter and grand-daughter and she told him to be quiet as Ellie-May was sleeping. When he went into her bedroom Hitchcott was crouched over her bed in a gap between the end of the bed and the wall.  He believed he was trying to wake Ellie-May, who was lying on her back. He askedshe was okay and he replied: “Yeah I think so.” Mr Coyle realised something was not right and when he askedshe was breathing. “When Mr Coyle looked at Ellie-May her eyes rolled back into her head and she looked ‘clammy’, the prosecution said during the trial.  Mr Coyle now knew that something terrible had happened to Ellie. An ambulance was called and after ing to the bedroom, Mr Coyle told Hitchcott to get Ellie-May, who still had the duvet over her, out of bed. Hitchcott pulled the covers about half way down the bed and put his hands under her torso and pulled and lted her up. The prosecution queried whether he was struggling to do so as her feet and legs were tied by the pink blanket and other material and he had not had time to unbind her. Mr Coyle and paramedics tried to resuscitate Ellie-May.  She was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital and was declared dead at .am. Police attending the scene found a pink and a blue blanket had been used as ligatures going under the mattress. The blue one - which would have corresponded with Ellie-May’s chest area - was undone but the pink one - which would have corresponded with her legs - was knotted and tied so tightly the sides of the mattress were raised off the bed frame by cm. Coyle later told police Hitchcott had been binding her daughter across the chest with the blue blanket since mid-January saying it would help her settle into a sleep routine and stop her banging her head on the wall.  In a statement which was read to the court, Ellie-Mays father John Minshull said: Every day me and my mum think about Ellie and really miss her, we just wish we could give her a big hug and it breaks our hearts deeply. He added: Now I cant be a dad to her no more, it destroys me inside. The couple, who both denied they had tied the youngster to the bed, were also convicted of one count of child cruelty by caging the child in her bed, and another count of child cruelty by restraining her in the bed. Their lodger, Connor Kirby, , of Octavia Court, Huyton, Liverpool, was cleared of all of the charges.

Security guard Bailey Walton, , had been struggling to pay back money he blew on betting machines until he discovered the windfall. The father of two thought it was Christmas and over the next month used the forbidden cash to pay off his debts before Lauren Woods boss Joanne Harvey realised the error. It is thought Miss Harvey, who runs a care services firm accidentally put an extra nought on the amount when paying wage money to Miss Wood by BACS. Miss Wood, , knew nothing of the windfall. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Walton, of Little Hulton near Salford admitted theft and was ordered to pay back all the cash.  He was also sentenced to  months jail suspended for two years and and complete  unpaid work hours. Miss Wood was initially charged with theft alongside Walton but the case against her was dropped. The court heard the botched transaction occurred on July  whilst Miss Wood was employed by Miss Harvey. Walton had control of the account as Miss Wood was unable to open one and when he saw the money had been deposited he made no contact with Miss Harvey and instead secretly spent the lot. The error was discovered the following month.  Judge Bernard Lever said: The employer made a mistake and he took advantage of this. He got a bank payment and thinks it’s Christmas. He didn’t intend to steal from her - it was her error that caused the problem. The judge told Walton: Your partner was working for a small firm and therefore vulnerable to financial loss. Miss Harvey said her and the company have been caused great problems and inconvenience due to your dishonesty. Your partner didn’t have the stable conduct to have her own account so it was paid into yours. She accidentally made a bank error and gave you  times as much as you should have got, being pound,. Miss Harvey has said the actions caused by the loss to the company has caused upset as a result of your dishonesty. You were not in a position of trust but in responsibility. You have a gambling problem and money issues and you took advantage of the mistake that was made. You could have ed the money, but you dissipated it. Now you will have to pay the money back.  The court heard Walton and Miss Wood have two children, one aged six and the other a baby in need of an operation. Miss Wood currently suffers with post natal depression. Defence lawyer Adam Brown said in mitigation: They have another baby on the way and an eight week old baby currently. They are now living together whilst he works in security at night. Their son has health issues in his stomach and is due to go through chemo surgery and they are combating this together. She is battling with depression. The money has now been dissipated as he had signicant gambling debts. He had control over the account so his partner was not involved. He gave it to people who he owed money to and he regrets doing it.  He had demonstrated that he can remain out of trouble. He attended the police station to admit to what he did. A reference from his employer said he has worked on door security for  years and he is a credit to security. I also have a reference from a man who he helped outside of a bar he helped him. He did take advantage of the situation but it was due to his own financial situation. Prosecuting Andrew Evans said earlier: He received a bank error of pound, but there was no further contact with the employer. His partner was completely unaware of the money going into that account. Charges have since been discontinued against his partner."},{"url":null,"title":"frazzled brits spend four hours","story":"NewsFrazzled Brits spend FOUR HOURS of their weekend catching up on workThe average Brit now puts in an extra three hours of work every dayShareCommentsByRob Knight:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsBrits spend up to four hours of their weekend catching up on work \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBusy Brits spend up to four hours of their weekend catching up with their workloads, it has emerged.

According to the Daily Mail, Prince Edward, who called himelf the Magical Bisector, apparently sawed nephew Peter Phillips - the son of Princess Anne and her first husband Captain Mark Phillips - in half. Edward, armed with a hand saw, got on stage to perform the old classic illusion for guests. The newspaper also reports that no one danced more enthusiastically in the Palace ballroom than Charles and we Camilla. Musical entertainment on the night was provided by Jools Holland, singer and actor Gary Wilmot, tenor and actor Alfie Boe, and US soprano Renee Fleming.  Other entertainment came in the form of a Welsh choir, Chinese acrobats and Canadian comedian Michel Lauziere, who is known for his novelty standup performances. After guests enjoyed drinks in the Picture Gallery, they then made their way to the ballroom where they feasted on salmon tartlet, poussin with autumn vegetables and an ice cream bombe dessert. Tables were reportedly decorated with blue table clothes, candlesticks and flowers from Highgrove Royal Gardens, which is the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwalls private residence. The Queen paid tribute to her son with a heart-warming toast saying: “It is a privilege for any mother to be able to propose a toast to her son on his th birthday. It means that you have lived long enough to see your child grow up. It is rather like —to use an analogy I am certain will find favour — planting a tree and being able to watch it grow. My mother saw me turn , of course. And she was heard to observe that  is exactly the age when the number of candles on your cake finally exceeds the amount of breath you have to blow them out.  Over his  years, Philip and I have seen Charles become a champion of conservation and the arts, a great charitable leader — a dedicated and respected heir to the throne to stand comparison with any in history — and a wonderful father. Most of all, sustained by his we Camilla, he is his own man, passionate and creative. So this toast is to wish a happy birthday to my son, in every respect a duchy original. To you Charles. To the Prince of Wales.” Other notable guests included Prince Albert of Monaco, Dame Maggie Smith, Dame Judi Dench and Queen Rania of Jordan.

Stephen Prosser, , claims he suffered soft tissue damage after the man wedged himself into the seat next to him. The company director claims he suffered personal injury and loss of earnings after being made to sit next to the large passenger during a -hour flight from Bangkok to Heathrow. On Friday, Pontypridd County Court heard the self-employed civil engineer claim cabin crew ignored his complaints that he would be injuredforced to sit next to the extremely large passenger, who he described as being ft in and weighing approximately  stones. Mr Prosser, who is ft in, said: He was that large that he had to force his buttocks between the arm rests of the seats.  I sat with his knees wedged against the seat in front and the rest of his body was over spilling into my seat by some inches. I was immediately aware that this was going to be problematic for me and I could feel the weight of his pure bulk putting lateral pressure on my upper body. This forced me into a position of unnatural posture. Due to the size of him when he placed his arm down at times it would rest on my armrest, and he would accidentally turn the volume of my audio up to an extremely loud volume each time. He said he chose not to take issue with the passenger because he seemed self conscious, but did complain to cabin crew, who allegedly told him there were no other seats available on the fully booked Boeing  and did not allow him to swap with someone .  Mr Prosser, from Penygraig in Tonypandy, South Wales, said the incident in January  left him with a continual back spasm and an injury causing his sacroiliac joint at the bottom of his spine to dys. He said being forced into an unnatural position during the long haul flight also aggravated his -year-old spine injury caused by driving long distances for work. He said he had been unable to work overtime as a result of his back pain, and left him lacking energy which had affected his relationship with his partner and forced him to give up mountain biking. Jack Harding, representing Mr Prosser, said the unusual case fell under the Montreal Convention , a treaty adopted by members states of the International Civil Aviation Organization concerning compensation for the victims of air disasters. Mr Harding said a figure of pound, had been submitted for the loss of earnings claim.  Timothy Salisbury, representing British Airways, said Mr Prosser was exaggerating by comparing the other passenger to the late New Zealand rugby legend Jonah Lomu, who was ft ins and weighed  stones. Mr Salisbury said: You say the man reminded you of the late rugby player Jonah Lomu. Would you say thats a colourful explanation  An exaggeration  Mr Prosser replied: Not at all. Mr Salisbury said cabin crew on the flight described the passenger as tall but not overweight so he had encroached on the other seat. Chris McLindon, the customer service manager on board the flight, said in a witness statement Mr Prosser did not seem to be in any discomfort and at times he was asleep.  Mr McLindon saida customer of the size Mr Prosser has claimed was on board they would have required an extension to their seat belt to fit around their body, and would also have had trouble lowering their armrest. Asked by District Judge Andrew Barcello what would happena passenger too large for the seats boarded the aircraft, Mr McLindon said: They would have to buy two seats. District Judge Andrew Barcello said he would reserve judgment and would schedule a hearing to announce the outcome of the case.

While right-wing extremist Bannon spoke inside the hallowed halls of the union, the crowd chanted: Who protects the Nazis  The police protect the Nazis!, Say it loud, say it clear, Bannon is not welcome here!. Police protected the entrances as Trumps former strategist spoke to a half-empty room inside. The former White House Chief Strategist has long faced accusations of stirring up racial tensions - and many perceive him to be the puppetmaster behind President Trumps toxic rhetoric.  The Oxford Mail reports numerous police officers reportedly in full riot gear were needed to get Bannon inside. He told the Union audience: Nazis and the KKK have no place in our society, they should have never been allowed to march in Charlottesville. The same can be said about Anta and Black Lives Matter - they shouldnt be allowed to do what they are doing. The talk was only announced two days before the event and comes after the cancellation of an appearance by a far-right German leader Alice Weidel at the institution earlier this month. At a time of fierce political isions on both sides of the Atlantic and the rise of right-wing political parties across Europe, many believe Mr Bannon to be one the central figures in the resurgence of the far-right with his aggressive political strategy. He said: I said I wanna unchain the dogs on Megyn Kelly and Im proud of it - politics is war by other methods. He also defended the toxic travel ban enacted at the start of the Trump era, saying: I did the original travel ban, it made our citizens safer. Zero-tolerance at the border is a humanitarian policy.  The protesters who were gathered outside the Union were furious Bannon had been offered a  to speak at the elite university. Michael, , and a history student at Oxford, said: I really dislike this pattern in the Union of people who are chosen to give a  - because they had Alice Weidelfrom the AFDand Tommy Robinson. It gives a  and legitimises the worst kind of political force. I particularly object to how the YouTube channel broadcast this to a far bigger audience than at the Oxford Union. Maritz, , an Austrian student studying politics in Oxford said: Im here to protest against the Student Union events being used for right-wing personalities. I am Austrian and we already have a fascist government so its important to fight right-wing politics while we still can. Anna Yalci, in her s, from Oxford and working in the NHS, said: I am here because I want to protest against the rise of racism and I do not think the Oxford Union should give credibility to Steve Bannon, because he is anti-Muslim - and my husband is a Muslim - and anti-Semitic.  He supports Donald Trump and Donald Trump represents all that is wrong with the current world. I have children and am about to be a grandmother. I do not want them to grow up in a world of hatred which is what Steve Bannon is preaching. While Alex, , a PhD Pathology student said: I just think it is an incredible move on the part of the Union to give a  to someone who spouts hatred and violence just to drum-up membership. I think they are really playing with fire to give a  to someone who wants to cause hatred and crime in the US. Im from the US and when I go back I feel scared in a way I have not felt before. Nick Grant, , and a member of the Socialist Workers Party said: We are socialists who oppose Steve Bannon quite fundamentally. He is someone who is trying to organise internationally for right-wing political forces which oppose migrants, women, sexual minorities and organised workers.  We believe he is a neo-Facist who historically big business organisations turn to at a time of economic crisis. His friend and fellow SWP member Chris Blakey, , said: We are really pleased with the turn out here. From : pm there has been masses of people on the this street and the other entrance and it is a wide range of of anti-fascists, students, academics and normal le people. There were no arrests by police. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said tonight: Officers are on the scene of a protest in Oxford. We were aware of planned protest activity around the Oxford Union in St Michaels Street. Officers are currently in the area working to prevent any incidents of crime and disorder.  Chief Superintendent Robert France said: Officers are currently outside the Oxford Union in the city centre where an event is taking place. A group of protesters, along with a counter protest group, have been present. Everyone has the right to demonstrate peacefully. We are working to facilitate peaceful protest balanced against the rights of the event organisers and free speech of those in attendance. Bannon was delayed leaving the Oxford Union by more than an hour as demonstrators continued their protest outside.

Texan Christopher Precopia was shocked when police arrested him while he was at work last September at a lumberyard in Williamson County. The New York Post reports that the -year-old was accused of burglary with intent to commit other crimes. At the time Precopia had no clue why he was being arrested, until he later discovered that his ex-girlfriend from high school reported him to the police with a made up story. He said: I had no idea why everything was happening, and I was lost. Precopias ex claimed that he broke into her home in Temple before cutting an X into her chest with a box cutter.  Police took him to Williamstown County Jail and released him only after his family posted a pound,bond. But on the night of the alleged attack, the lumberjack worker was actually  miles away at a hotel in Austin with his mum, Erin Precopia. And to prove this, he had taken a selfie of himself with his family on that night, which he shared on social media. Mrs Precopia said: By the grace of God, [the accuser] said it happened on the day when I can say totally,  per cent, where he was at.  Although he had a solid alibi, authorities charged him anyway, which police experts told broadcaster KVUE might have been presumptuous. The station explained that usually police interview suspects before charging them with a crime. Precopias lawyer, Rick Flores, told ABC News in America that at the time of the arrest Precopia asked what the reason was. He claimed that their response was: Something along the lines of, ‘don’t act like you don’t know what we’re talking about’. The police affidavit confirmed that Christopher was charged with first-degree felony burglary of a habitation, with intent to commit additional felonies. Flores added that offence was punishable by up to  yearsconvicted.  Police finally dropped the charges nine months after his arrest when his lawyer brought the alibi evidence - the selfie - to Bell County prosecutors. As she is not being charged with a crime, his accusers identity is not being made public. She later admitted to Temple police that she reported Precopia because of a dficult relationship with him several years earlier. Flores sad: “Most of the time, we deal with grey matters. It’s not normally black or white. But this is one of those cases where I could definitely prove he did not commit this offence.”  Flores said that the family has not been contacted by Precopia’s accuser. He believed that it was “staged”, including destroying a vase and throwing things around her home so it looked like there was a struggle. Precopias mum said the arrest had severely affected him and that “he’s not the same kid he was a year and a half ago, which breaks my heart.”"},{"url":null,"title":"japanese man spends 14000 marry","story":"NewsJapanese man spends £, to marry a hologram in bizarre ceremonyAkihiko Kondo, , held a lavish ceremony to wed the stuffed doll at Tokyo Hall in JapanShareCommentsByHannah DoddVideo Journalist:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video man-marries-hologram-bizarre-ceremony-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Japanese man has shelled out a whopping pound, for his wedding - to a hologram.

Despite shelling out for his special day, none of his family members or friends attended the event.A video of the ceremony shows Akihiko gazingly lovingly into the eyes of a small stuffed doll.The doll was even fitted with a wedding ring on its wrist to represent the hologram. In the clip, Akihiko moves the dolls veil - and long aqua marine pig tails - away from its face before giving the doll a long, painfully slow, kiss. He also reads a wedding speech to the doll, although it wasnt entirely clearshe was pleased either way. Since March, Kondo has been living with a moving, talking hologram of Miku that floats in a , desktop device. Gatebox, the company that produces the hologram device has issued a marriage certicate, which certies that a human and a virtual character have wed beyond dimensions.

There was no sign of a murder weapon and no clues left behind as to who killed her. The locked room murder became infamous, with the gruesome and unusual details of the case inspiring crime novels and TV dramas. But what is it like to actually live in the house behind one of Liverpools greatest mysteries  More than  years later, the impossible murder that baffled detectives remains unsolved - but the cold case continues to attract amateur sleuths set on cracking it. On the night of January , Julias husband William came home to find the house completely locked and blanketed in total darkness.  After calling on his neighbours John and Florence Johnston for help, Wallace walked into the house, lit a lamp and came back out saying: Oh come and see, shes been killed. When the couple entered the Wallace home, they found -year-old Julie sprawled out in the sitting room in front of the gas fire, having been beaten to death. The room was a scene of utter horror, with Julias leless body lying in a pool of her own blood, and splatters from the attack sprayed across the walls.  Staring at his wes battered and beaten body, Wallace turned to his neighbours and said: Theyve finished her, look at her brains. The Liverpool Echo spoke to the family who moved into the Wolverton Street property at the centre of the chilling tale and asked what its like living at an address famous for a grizzly murder. John Taylor was actually born and raised on Wolverton Street, in the shadow of Liverpool FCs Anfield stadium, moving into the Wallaces old house across the road in .  John knew all about the history of Number  when he moved into the property - its impossible to live on Wolverton Street and not know about it. It all unfolded in the front room of the couples Wolverton Street home, where John now lives with his children Oliver, seven, and Rubin, three. However, John said the houses history didnt bother him in the slightest when he chose to move in. He said: I knew all about the murder - Ive lived in the street all my le. It didnt bother me at all. I grew up with it - they did films in the street. I knew all about it - Im not really one for ghosts and things like that. Im not scared of anything like that.  While John might not be bothered by the propertys macabre history, his carefree attitude isnt shared by everyone who visits the house. Although John doesnt believe in ghosts, hauntings or supernatural goings-on, friends and family have certainly felt a spooky presence in the property. The -year-old dad-of-two added: A few people have felt a few things in the house - things brushing past you. My mate had something brush past him - Ive had it too.  Something has been on my mates lap - a pen - and it literally flew across the room, like someone threw it over the room. Its not really scared me at all. But Johns partner Jane Owings is slightly more unsettled by the houses gruesome history. She said: John reckons he has felt things. His friend over the road said someone has blown on him. I always say dont tell me - Ill be too scared!  EvenI did feel something I would ignore it! John got a film on the murder and wanted to watch it and I was like no way! The impossible murder at Wolverton Street took place more than  years ago, and unsurprisingly the property has been considerably modernised over the years. However, some original features remain in the property - offering a hidden reminder of the houses history. Knowing what unfolded in the front room of the house on that night in , Jane thought it was best to move things around to try and put it out of her mind.  She added: Some things are still the original features in there, like the ceiling. I changed where the living room was and we dont really use it. We shut the door and use it for Christmas dinner. The the dog starts barking and Im thinking I cant hear anything! Despite the decades that have passed since the murder took place, the case continues to fascinate people and the details live on in the memories of locals.  Telling people you live in a house associated with such an infamous case attracts its fair share of attention, with John saying: People are sort of fascinated and askyouve seen anything in the house. Jane said: Its quite interesting when you tell people or taxi drivers will tell you thats a famous house they dont believe you live there! Since Wallaces death, the case of Julias murder has never been solved.  The mystery has attracted countless theorists and armchair detectives to put forward their own suggestions for who was behind the crime. Julias murder even inspired a number of murder mysteries - including P.D. James  crime novel The Skull Beneath the Skin.

The military cadets has grown from scratch to number , military cadets in just two-and-a-half years, new figures show. Some  boys and girls from northern naval ports Severodvinsk and Arkhangelsk swore their oath of allegiance to the ‘military and patriotic’ movement on board the fearsome ft Dmitry Donskoy, moored in Belomorsk on the White Sea. The Russian YunArmia has smashed the quarter of a million barrier, seeing a rise of more than , recruits since February, with youngsters mainly aged from  to . However, the organisation’s website says children aged -plus can join.  Critics say Putin’s YunArmia is a visible sign of the increased militarisation in Russia under Putin - and liken it to the Hitler Youth. Supporters counter argue the force is a way of installing patriotism and discipline in children, and keeping them out of trouble, while gaining valuable skills. On board the Dmitry Donskoy - the largest submarine of any kind in the world - the cadets were presented with badges with official symbols of the youth movement. After the solemn ceremony,where retired vice admiral Oleg Tregubov took the salute, the children were given a tour of the vessel to see how the crew lives and works.  Cadets from the Baltic to the Pacic are trained in using Kalashnikov weapons in what some experts say is military “propaganda”. Their oath reads: I swear to aim for victories in studies and sports, to live a healthy lestyle, to make myself prepared for the service and labour for the sake of the Motherland, to cherish the memory of the heroes who fought for freedom and independence of our Motherland, to be a patriot and a dignied citizen of Russia. The moving force behind the rise of this youth force is hawkish defence minister Sergei Shoigu, a close ally and personal friend of Putin’s.  When it was formed one Russian website complained that the young army was plagiarising Hitler Youth - but the report was swtly removed. Something similar to German organisation Hitler Youth is coming from Russia, it stated. Other criticism has been more muted.  Irina Abankina, head of the Institute for development of education: Beyond any doubt, education in the spirit of responsibility and patriotism is extremely important. However, it is very easy to cross the line and go into a lot more aggressiveness.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss jim hails the impact of new signing martin woods","story":"Jim McIntyre hailed the impact of new signing Martin Woods on his full debut in the - draw with St Mirren.And the Dundee boss is hoping the former Ross County midfielder can build a telling partnership with Glen Kamara in the middle of the park.The Dens boss thought the two complemented each other well against the Buddies and was impressed with Woods’ staying power, playing  minutes in his first start since May.He said: “Martin was really struggling in the last  minutes.“He felt a wee bit of tightness in his hamstring as well.“He just managed through it to the end as we had made all our subs by then.“But I thought considering he has not been involved in a team structure, then he did remarkably well.“He used his experience and I thought him and Glen looked very strong together.“I don’t want sitting midfielders, I want them to be getting up and around the box.“I thought on Saturday, Glen and Woods really complemented each other, they were excellent.”Woods, meanwhile, is one of a number of players the physio is keeping an eye on over the international break.The Dundee boss added: “Woods has a tight hamstring and Benjy Kallman has a bit of fluid on his knee so we will see how that settles down.“Andy Boyle’s stitches are in a really awkward place on his kneecap.“If you burst the stitches it can take a long time so we have been really careful with him.“Roarie Deacon has a thigh strain but we think it is not as bad as the problem he had previously so, hopefully, we will see him sooner rather than later.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee defender kerr waddell extends morton loan spell","story":"Defender Kerr Waddell has extended his loan spell at Morton, Dundee have confirmed.Then-Morton boss Ray McKinnon took Waddell on loan at the start of the season and although the former Dundee United manager quickly moved to Falkirk, the centre half has featured regularly for The Ton.That left their management team of Jonatan Johansson and Peter Houston keen to hold on to him until the end of the campaign.Dundee have been agreeable to that but they see the -year-old as having a big future at Dens Park.Taking to social media Waddell voiced his pleasure at completing the deal.He wrote on Twitter: #Delighted to be staying here till the end of the season, loved every minute so far.#Waddell will now be eligible to play for Morton in the Scottish Cup this season."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bed596bdd606.jpg ","title":"i felt suicidal dundee woman 36 bullied for having red hair","story":"As a young woman she was taunted and teased for no reason other than the fact she had red hair. vw, px\"  The bullying and abuse got so bad that at times a teenage Leanne believed the only way she could escape from her tormentors would be to kill herself.The psychological impact of her ordeal led to her being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.And tragically for the -year-old civil servant from Menzieshill, the bullying she endured as a child has followed her into adulthood.Today Leanne – not her real name – spoke out as part of Anti-Bullying Week  to try to persuade others not to suffer in silence eventhey are struggling to find the strength to speak out.The name-calling she was subjected to haunts her to this day and has had a profound impact on the rest of her le.She revealed: “One of the reasons I don’t have children of my own is because I was so badly bullied as a child, all because I had red hair.“Ginger ferret, ginger freak and ginger fuzzy hair were just some of the names I was called.“At one point in secondary school I felt suicidal, it was so bad.

We have been bringing primary children into secondary schools and getting senior pupils to talk to them about the impact of bullying.“We find it’s much easier for younger pupils to approach a senior one with their concerns rather than going to an adult.“The senior pupils have had training and know how to help. We are also asking parents to be pro-active. A lot of bullying goes on outside school because of social media.“We’re getting parents into schools and educating them about what can go on and showing them what to look out for. We want parents to come to usthey are concerned and before the bullying goes too far.”David Baxter, of the local branch of the EIS, said: “We are taking part in a lot of good work with the education department to address bullying.#One of the big issues is that bullying has moved out of the playground and classroom and gone behind closed doors. We’re trying to show pupils and parent how to deal with this.”"},{"url":null,"title":"no discussions over glen kamara deal as time running out for finn at dundee","story":"The future of Dundee’s star midfielder Glen Kamara remains unclear with only months remaining on his contract.The -year-old has joined the Finnish international squad for their crucial Nations League clashes with Greece and Hungary.However, his future at Dens Park may be coming to an end with manager Jim McIntyre admitting there has been no talks over any extension.He said: “We have not had that conversation yet.“I know there has been interest in him. He is a very good player and I can understand the interest.“All we are doing right at this moment is assessing what we have got and then moving forward there will be discussions.”With plenty of speculation over a transfer in the summer with clubs like Sunderland, Rangers, Celtic, Hearts and Hibs credited with interest in his services, suitors in the January window won’t be hard to find.Meanwhile, the Dark Blues are hoping injured central defender Josh Meekings won’t need surgery on his troublesome hip that would mean the end of his season.The -year-old has been out of action since the start of September but the club hope a further injection in the injury will sort the issue without needing to go under the kne.He said: “Meekings is having another injection and we will take it from there.“But there is the possibility he could face further surgery whichthat was the case, he would be out for the season.“Hopefully, the conservative treatment of having a jag will get him through it.”Martin Woods , Benjy Kallman , Andy Boyleand Roarie Deaconall have knocks but aren’t expected to be missing for the trip to Hibs next week."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/15232329.jpg ","title":"st mirren showing has to be minimum level for us to avoid drop says dundee winger ralph","story":"Saturday’s improved performance against St Mirren is the minimum level Dundee can allow themselvesthey have any chance of avoiding relegation, according to defender Nathan Ralph.The Dark Blues felt they let the Buddies off the hook at Dens Park at the weekend in the - draw in what the full-back called one of their best displays of the season.And he insists that has to be the standard they maintain for the rest of the campaign.Ralph said: “I think it was a chance missed. I felt like we played as well as we have all season.“We should have won the game and I felt we were the better team for most of it.“To not get the three points was disappointing but the manager said it’s definitely something to build on and we’ll look to do that.“When you are where we are in the table, the ball doesn’t seem to drop for you but you have to keep fighting through it.“The manager told us that Saturday was the standard now – we need to stick to it and make sure it doesn’t go below that.”The Dark Blues head into the international break still bottom of the Premiership with just four points to their name after picking up just their second result of the season.Despite their very poor start to the campaign, the players still have belief they can get themselves out of trouble and the work they’ve been doing under new boss Jim McIntyre will pay idends.“It’s still there, the players believe in what we are doing, that showed against St Mirren and everyone is buying into it, so I feel like it’s just a matter of time,” added Ralph.“The intensity has been really high in training and the manager definitely demands hard work.“I think we showed that on Saturday.“We’ve got the international break now and I feel like it would have been good to have another game this week and keep the momentum going. However, we’ll definitely be working on things over the next couple of weeks and look to improve on Saturday’s performance.”Ralph was something of a surprise inclusion against the Buddies, having been missing from first-team action since the end of August with a damaged hamstring tendon.The former Woking man admits he had a slow start to le at Dens Park in his opening games but put on an impressive show in just his third league appearance for the club.The left-back was strong in the air, confident on the ball and an attacking threat throughout Saturday’s - draw.The -year-old admits he was blowing a bit by the end after a tough game but was delighted to get a first  minutes under his belt in over two months.“It had been a while but it felt good to be back out there and, with the slow start I’d had at Dundee, it was nice to have a decent performance as well,” added the former Yeovil Town man.“It would have been nice to get the win, too, but you can’t have everything.“I felt alright by the end, not as bad as I thought I might be having been out so long.“It was just about getting through that first  minutes and it’ll get better from here.“It’s never nice to be sitting on the sidelines, especially with the way the results have been going. You feel like you want to help out where you can and obviously being injured, you can’t.“It had been a long time doing that so it felt good to be back out there and help us get a point on the board.“We need to build on that now.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bec01fb2effb.jpg ","title":"tonight dundees glen kamara buzzing to build on first international goal","story":"After opening his international goal account last time out, Glen Kamara is “buzzing” to have the chance to help Finland qualy for the Nations League play-offs.The -year-old fired in his first-ever senior goal as his country saw off Greece - last month in Tampere to keep up their % record in League C Group Two.The Finns head to Athens tonight needing just a point to confirm their promotion to League B after a superb run that’s seen them yet to concede a goal in their four matches that’s also seen a home-and-away double over Estonia.The team’s successes over the past few months are in complete contrast to his club season at Dundee this campaign.With the Dark Blues languishing at the foot of the Premiership table and goals few and far between, manager Jim McIntyre has urged his midfield to provide more goal threat.And Kamara, who has been pushed further forward by his new boss lately, says he has ambitions to add some club goals to his single international effort.“I’d say I’ve had about one shot in my time at Dundee!” the former Arsenal man said.“I definitely need to shoot more and try to help out the team with goals, it is something I’m working on.”And despite firing in a goal for his country that sealed victory over the Greeks, Kamara wasn’t overly proud by the quality of his first touch.He said: “What was the goal like  Don’t watch it!“I made a really bad touch into a good touch and a finish.“It was great, something I didn’t expect but I was buzzing after it.“It’s a great feeling to score for your country and we got a - win over Greece as well.“They are coming up again so we’ll have to be ready again.”Ranked th in the world and below upcoming opponents Greece and Hungary in the world rankings, the Finns’ record of four wins from their first four Nations League games have surprised onlookers.However, Kamara insists nobody within the camp is surprised at how well they’ve fared.Under manager Markku Kanerva, the Eagle Owls as they are nicknamed, have spread their wings and begun to fly after years in the international wilderness following the retirement of former Ajax great and Liverpool forward Jari Litmanen.That’s despite a lack of household names with Norwich striker Teemu Pukki most likely to be known to football fans on these shores after an unsuccessful spell at Celtic.Momentum is building, however, and the Finns will be hopeful of finding a backdoor route to Euro  through winning their Nations League group.That needs at least one point from tonight’s trip to Athens or the game against Hungary in Budapest on Sunday.Kamara said: “The team is in a good place, the manager is doing well and they are a good group of boys.“Things are going well in the Nations League and we have a good chance of winning our group.“We have Greece and Hungary up this week and with a win I’d say we’ll top the group.“That’s maybe surprised a few people but the team knew we were good enough after playing a few games together and,you watch us, you can see we are at a good level right now.”Kamara’s Dundee team-mate Benjamin Kallman has also featured for the full national side this year, though is more often involved with the U  squad.He remains at Dens Park this week as the young Finns don’t have any fixtures scheduled."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub

It is something that we are working hard for.”Some pressure descended on McLeish and his players after the dismal display against Israel. Shinnie said: “Football is always pressure.“We know that everyone in the squad can handle it, they prove it at club level and it is about going out and proving it on the day.“These two games are massive for us andwe can win both of them you will get the plaudits so you take the good and the bad.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/11/5bee6928f1bac-940x561.jpg ","title":"aberdeen football pitch to be closed until spring after sinkhole opens up","story":"An Aberdeen football pitch is set to stay out of action for several months to allow the surface to recover after repairs to a sinkhole.A void nearly a metre wide had opened up in the middle of the pitch at St Machar Academy playing fields. vw, px\"  Thought to be several metres deep, it led to a match between Stonehaven’s Cowie Thistle and Aberdeen’s Woodside being abandoned earlier this month.The sinkhole had been spotted during half-time of the match on November .It proved to be too big to fill and the game was called off for safety reasons.

I think it’s important to show other people with a disability it doesn’t matter.“You can learn to swim and don’t need to go into private lessons. They can go into the normal Learn to Swim programme.“Swimming’s been a huge part of my le. It’s given me more confidence and so many experiences to travel and meet new people.“If you want to take it up I think it’s a really good thing to do.”Toni’s journey in aquatics began on the Learn to Swim programme at Northfield Swimming Pool, before she joined Cults Otters club.Her talent saw her move to join up with the Aberdeen University high-performance squad.The  Tokyo Paralympics hopeful has experience as an instructor – teaching her own mum how to swim.Her role will involve promoting swimming among youngsters at launches across the country, with world, Olympic and European champion Duncan Scott another of the governing body’s ambassadors. vw, px\"  Paul Wilson, disability performance development manager for Scottish Swimming, said: “Toni has had some success on the international stage, so in terms of inspiration to younger athletes she’s the perfect role model for us.“The key thing is, with her age.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

They’ve been getting themselves involved in drug-taking. “Mr Thomson could do with some support.” Sherf John Montgomery told the pair: “You both tell me that you want to change – well I can provide you with an opportunity to do that with a community payback order. “If you don’t comply with the terms of the order you’ll be brought back before me and we know what will happen.” Coughtrie and Thomson were ordered to be under supervision for  months.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCourtsPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo. Credit where itrsquos due, this incredible young cast, who reprised their roles as servants and New Yorkers, were amazing, bringing le to the entire show.But Anniersquos cunning plan to escape fails, and it isnrsquot long before she is dragged back to the evil clutches of the vile Miss Hannigan, played by Lizzie Bell. What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo. Stardom beckons for the pooch, whom Irsquom sure could be crowned a Peeblesshire Pet Idol in the future!Praise swept over social media for the young cast last week, leaving many hoping this will be the first of many shows by the talented KIYT cast.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

This process starts again now and the Conservative Group will play the fullest role it can in determining a responsible approach to our vital infrastructure.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said: ldquoMore investment is required in roads to ensure that we keep up the momentum.ldquoIt is concerning that the current level of investment is not enough to prevent conditions deteriorating further.

With  holiday lodges crammed on to the former fairways, the beautul landscape and its wildle will be lost forever. There is another way! A country park, managed by a charitable trust, could deliver fantastic community benefits, education and natural play spaces, as well as jobs and spend in the local community, enhancing rather than damaging the environment.The spokesman said it was ldquohugely questionable that  new self-catered lodges were needed, adding: ldquoAny search on [property rental website] Airbnb will show an average of  self-catering options available in North Berwick pretty much every week between September and May, so an additional  could actually overload and damage the existing tourism market.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

For  years ndash  with his own business ndash he designed and carved gravestones.ldquoWe covered the islands and up north, we had agents all over the place, he said this week. ldquoI took up photography in , because my we was getting fed up looking at me, and it has given me more of an artistic look at le than when I had all the design work I was doing with the gravestones for all these years.He was taken under the wing of Archie Reid, a Dunoon photographer, and a friend of his when they were younger.ldquoEverything is kept simple and basic. Compose your image, donrsquot just go running at it. Walk around. I try to do that so that when I get to the screen, therersquos very little left to do.ldquoMy camera is a Canon D that I bought from Archie. Itrsquos not like the huge cameras you can get nowadays. I use a couple of filters [attached to the front of the lens to enhance the final shot] and my favourite lens is a Sigma mm-mm. Archie put me onto it, and I can do everything with it.

I noticed it one day when I went to collect my son. This would have been around .I mentioned it to a friend. She and I were in the same womens group and a friend of hers had died from breast cancer. The brass plaque beside the tree was mottled and not very well looked after.One day I saw my friend cleaning it. She told me that her friend who died had been active in the feminist economic movement and she was cleaning the plaque in her memory. The Glasgow Womens Library got involved and they campaigned for it to be Tree of the Year in .The Suffragette Oak makes me think about the forgotten history of these women: the hard work and striving that went unnoticed. Thanks to these women who went that extra mile, we now have the vote ndash we have a voice.The tree was badly damaged in a storm last year and the council had to make it safe. The bits cut off were given to Glasgow Womens Library and they are making it into things to sell to raise funds. Isnt that lovely Another special tree was one I saw at a holiday place we rented at Achnacloich, near Oban.The gardens there have this amazing redwood that looks like a gigantic hand.The reason it looks like a hand was that when it was planted a rabbit kept nibbling the bud in the middle. Every time this rabbit nibbled it, another shoot would come out the side. It was one of the first redwoods to be grown in Scotland.We were staying there with loads of kids and it was the best climbing tree in the world ndash they would get lost in it.You would be sitting outside having a cup of tea in the morning and suddenly hear a wee voice from up in the tree asking: \"Whats your favourite flavour of crisps \"Carole Baxter, Beechgrove Garden presenterI LOVE rowan trees. All the species are beautul. There is such a range of colourful berries and they are a hardy plant. In my garden in Aberdeenshire I have eight ieties including cashmiriana, Joseph Rock and the native rowan.I have enjoyed the rowan for its berries as long as I can remember, certainly from a young age. It is a value-for-money plant: you have the blossom and fruits, lovely foliage and great autumn colour.People perhaps arent aware of the range of species and named ieties. You dont need to have the one that has the orange-red berries you can get white, yellow and pink berries.There are some small ones as well, such as Sorbus reducta which is ideal for a rock garden. We have that one at Beechgrove as well as vilmorinii, which has pink berries with almost blueish foliage. Those were my plant choices.What is interesting is that birds tend to home in on the red and orange berries to start off with so,you have cashmiriana with its white berries, it tends to hold the berries a bit longer.This year has been particularly good for the fruits because we had a cold spring and it gradually got warmer, so we didnt have the frost and the blossoms werent damaged, which was then followed by a nice hot summer.It is nothing to do with the fact we are going to have a hard winter as people often say ndash thats an old wives tale ndash it is the fact that we have had a good season.Episodes of Beechgrove Garden are available on BBC iPlayer until November Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmakerSCOTS pine has been my favourite tree from a young age. I grew up on Mull and I have always loved woodland. I spent a lot of time as a kid walking through the woods.One walk we did took us a mile or so out of Tobermory. When you are eight or nine, even just going a couple of miles out of town feels like you are exploring the other side of the planet.It was while out walking that I first saw a Scots pine. It was one of those classic old \"granny\" pines with so much character, the limbs were all twisted ndash there was one that came out at a right angle and shot skywards.This Scots pine stood among mixed birch and there was no other tree around it that looked the same. It seemed so exotic and out of place. Your eye was drawn to it.As I got older and spent time in the Cairngorms and Abernethy Forest, I learned that much of Scotland was covered in forests filled with these trees. I thought it was the most magical habitat.The tree then became a symbol for all the wildle that you find living in those forests. I have spent time filming capercaillie as well as red deer, red squirrels and pine martens among the trees.Weirdly, now I have travelled further than just a couple of miles out of town, whenever I see Scots pine, they dont look exotic to me. I have recently been working in Russia where there is mixed birch woodland and what I call \"Caledonian Forest\" ndash this reminder of home.My love of Scots pine is undiminished but they have gone from being a symbol of the exotic to something very familiar.A couple of years ago I was working in a mountainous region of Turkey and you could almost have been in the Cairngorms. It was very similar. I felt at home.Animal Families and Me with Gordon Buchanan is at Kirkintilloch Town Hall on November , Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh on November  and Rothes Halls in Glenrothes on November Kirsty Wark, broadcasterA TREE is a marker, something you look out for at a particular time of year. My Japanese maple in the garden, for example, you just know when the leaves are going to turn, be vivid and then flutter to the ground.The yellow-berried rowan is one of my favourite trees. I love lime trees because I think they are so vivid in the landscape.Trees represent a constancy. Planting trees is entirely altruistic because, unless they are fast-growing, you are never in your letime going to get the real benefit of them. I love the fact that parks were laid out by the Victorians ndash and even much earlier with Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown.After my father died, we planted a rowan where he loved to fish most, which was Kendoon Loch in Galloway. That was in . It is beside the water and Im not sure it is the most fertile place for it, but it is hanging on in there. I went to see it last week.In Celtic mythology the rowan symbolises courage and protection. That is why you will often see old houses with rowans planted in the front garden by the gate. We planted a red rowan for Dad, but I really like a yellow rowan too.I used to know the names of all the trees because I was in the Brownies. I dont know them all now. I love walking in the forest up to Glenashdale Falls and Whiting Bay on Arran, those specic spaces where you are surrounded by flora and fauna.Sir John Lister-Kaye, author and naturalistTHERE is an ash tree that is one of the biggest trees in the garden here at House of Aigas near Beauly and almost certainly the oldest ndash it is possibly  years old. It is right beside the house.Ashwas a very valuable timber throughout the th and th centuries. It was used for all sorts of things ndash implement handles, cart frames, furniture.It is a very good, close-grained hardwood. Very few ash trees ever survived more than  or  years, perhaps  years, because they were too valuable. Highlanders were not well off and it was a good way of making money.There are very few old ash trees in the Highlands. This one has survived simply because it is so close to an th-century house and I think the owners must have said many times: \"Dont fell that tree, we like it\". And so it survived.What is wonderful about it is that it has survived for so long and that means it has seen so much. For instance, it will have seen Bonnie Prince Charlie come through raising the clans which, of course, culminated in the Battle of Culloden.It saw the folk mourning after the loss of Culloden and it saw Cholmondeleys regiment come and camp here and then burn the tacksmans house down right beside it. The tree must have been scorched by that fire. The Frasers who were living here at the time were all murdered in May .It has witnessed some real horrors. Later, it will have witnessed the Highland Clearances, people pulling out and leaving for the New World. It will have witnessed the Victorians arriving with their grand ideas and turning the place into a sporting estate.This \"loftier ash\", as I call it ndash because that is what Fraxinus excelsior means ndash has seen a lot of history and for that reason alone it is a very valuable tree. In my book Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey, I dedicated a whole chapter to it.Let me read you a bit from it: \"The ash tree has witnessed it all. I stand at its foot. Great roots have corrugated the ground around it with broad woody thongs undulating outwards in a circular plate of tangle and deep grip, roots that trail far across the lawns in every direction.\"It is solid, purposeful, locked in. Its trunk writhes with power. It is all heart. My fullest reach, both arms stretched, extends to less than a third of its circumference an inconsequential hug leaving me in awe of its rigid grandeur.\"Its bark is deeply grooved with long vertical ripples of hardness like a throng of ribbed buttresses all heading upward, shoring up its might, shedding veils of green dust at my touch.\"The bark fissures draw in treecreepers: those tiny mouse-like birds that dash upwards in little jerky pulses, defying gravity. Then, giving in to the earths pull, they flick down again, back to start, like a game of snakes and ladders never won.\"I am enthralled by this tree, rapt. Every time I stand here, I shrink it grows. I age it shrugs off such foibles and just goes on expanding into a thousand shaded alleys. What is  minutes or a week when you are  years old \"Song of the Rolling Earth: A Highland Odyssey by Sir John Lister-Kaye is published by Abacus, priced pound.. Visit aigasPaul Murton, Grand Tours of Scotland presenterA TREE that I have always admired is a rowan that grows from a huge boulder. It is one that everyone will have seen as they are driving north up the A to Fort William.Just as you get to Rannoch Moor and are climbing up above Loch Tulla, there on the left-hand side of the road is a massive boulder left over from the Ice Age.There is a crack in it where, for many years, this amazing little rowan tree has been growing.It has been blasted by the elements and cant be getting many nutrients from the rock, so I dont know how it survives.There is something quite symbolic about it. I have filmed it several times for programmes over the years. It also appears in one of my favourite books, Mountaineering in Scotland by WH Murray.In fact, the first time I saw this rowan tree was in WH Murrays book when I was  or .I hitchhiked from Dunoon to Glencoe to go climbing and I remember seeing it in the flesh and thinking: \"Oh, thats the one in the book\".That was exciting because I felt I was on the trail of real mountaineers. Any mountaineer who had been up to Glencoe going back decades will have seen that wee tree.How did it end up there  Perhaps a crow or a raven carried a berry, dropped it and it then got stuck in a crack where there was enough nutrients for roots to grow. It must be at least  years old.Im a bit of a secret tree hugger. I planted a lot of trees at my mothers place in Argyll years ago and it is nice to admire how much they have grown. There are a couple of chestnut trees, beech trees and Scots pine.Episodes of Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs are available on BBC iPlayer until November . The series will be repeated on BBC in Greg McHugh, actorI GREW up in Morningside in Edinburgh and at the bottom of the garden were steps down to a wood. There was a mud road with a wall and trees behind it. I loved spending time there.All the kids in my street would go down and play. It was an incredible place. I know people think of Morningside as being posh, but this wasnt a kept space. It was completely wild and overgrown. My mum would always shout as I went out the door: \"Dont go near the giant hogweed!\"It was this little hidden spot in the city. When I was in third year at school, I did a history project on it and learned that this was the old \"poorhouse\" road that had grown over.To think of the families that would have walked up and down there, the trees have been witness to all of that.We would gather conkers, climb and make rope swings among the trees and put old doors down over the stream. On fireworks night there would be a big bonfire and all the families in the street went along.One of my brothers mates stood on a wasps nest and was incredibly badly stung. Afterwards it gave spending time among the trees a new element of risk. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, while during the day it was our playground, we would never dare go down there at night.The inaugural Scottish Tree Festival organised by Discover Scottish Gardens features more than  tree-themed events and runs until December .

To find a location, he followed instructions said to have come to him in a dream and loaded panniers of gold on the back of a donkey.William followed the animal as it roamed across his lands. When night fell, it rested under a tree on a higher and rockier site close to the steep-sided Allt Dearg.The castle was built on that spot with the unique quirk that it was constructed around the tree. This subsequently became a feature of part of the cellar, known since as ldquoThe Hawthorn Room.Legend has it that the tree has magical qualities which have on more than one occasion saved the castle from disaster.Modern scientic analysis has revealed that the tree died in approximately , most likely as a result of being deprived of light because the castle had been built around it.

Having a jury rule that the case against you was ldquonot proven might suggest that you got off on a technicality, or that the prosecution just hadnrsquot got its act together. Defence lawyers argued that guilt should be expunged by an unequivocal declaration of not guilty ndash meaning he or she really, really didnrsquot do it. The late former Scottish Secretary, Donald Dewar, moved a Commons Bill in  to have the ldquobastard verdict, as Sir Walter Scott called it, scrapped. But this wasnrsquot because he thought it would necessarily make rape convictions easier.Not proven still has its defenders. Some say abolition would undermine Scots law and that we shouldnrsquot be importing an Anglicised system on a wave of emotion. It is good for juries to have more than one option so that they can express a degree of doubt, or qualication. Brian McConnachie QC, the former President of the Criminal Bar Association, has pointed out abolishing it could have unintended consequences. As we discovered during the debate about scrapping corroboration in rape trials, getting rid of one anomaly often creates a raft of new ones.In Scottish jury trials there need only be a simple majority for conviction, eight to seven in a -person jury. In England the test is much stricter ndash there are smaller juries and the majority has to be  out of . If not proven is dispensed with, many would argue that the Scottish majoritarian system would have to go too. This might actually make it harder to get rape convictions.Indeed, you could argue that not proven gives an ldquoeasy option the other way ndash in favour of the accuser. It allows juries who believe the ldquovictim, but are not convinced by the prosecutionrsquos handling of the case, to say: ldquoWe think he or she probably did do it, even though the evidence isnrsquot conclusive. This arguably sends a signal to the civil courts that this person might be guilty on the balance of probabilities. Civil courts are less strict on the need to prove ldquobeyond reasonable doubt.This is actually what happened in the case of Miss M, the rape victim who has been arguing for not proven to be scrapped. She made legal history last month by taking the not proven verdict against former student Stephen Coxen to the Personal Injuries Court in Edinburgh, where it was effectively reversed. She was awarded pound, in damages. Of course, that raises further questions about double jeopardy. If someone is found not guilty in one court, does it makes sense for them to be found guilty in another If you accept the #metoo doctrine ndash ldquoalways believe the victim ndash then you donrsquot really need trials at all. However, this causes problems when the wrong people get accused. When one of the leading figures in the #metoo movement, the Hollywood actress Asia Argento, was accused in August of statutory rape of an underage boy in Calornia, her defenders insisted that she should be given the benefit of ldquodue process, and be innocent until proven guilty. This was correct. The rush to judgment was wrong and unfair ndash even though she reportedly gave the ldquovictim , to settle the claim privately.The problem with sexual assault and rape is that they often involve dficult cases relying, in the absence of corroboration, on ldquohe said she said and the credibility of the parties involved. I have never sat on a rape case jury, but Irsquove spoken to many who have, and they tell me the cases often involve alcohol and vague and muddled memories. It is probably the case that too few rapists are being punished. But tipping the scales in favour of the victims doesnrsquot always work.The justice system in England has been rocked by the collapse of a succession of highly-publicised rape trials in which the police withheld, or failed to disclose, evidence crucial tothe defence. The former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, had to make a formalapology, and then resigned last month, after a review covering just two months of English rape cases found that  had to be halted because the police had failed to hand over evidence of innocence. The police insist that they werenrsquot trying to rig the prosecutions. But the head of the politan Police, Cressida Dick, has since issued new guidance saying that ldquocomplainants in rape and sexual assault cases should be listened to, but not automatically believed. ldquoItrsquos not all about the victims she said.Justice is hard. The debate over not proven has been grinding on for a long time. Holyroodrsquos Justice Committee has said that the dual acquittal is on ldquoborrowed time ndashwhich I suppose is itself a kind of not proven verdict. Scrapping the Scottish verdictis beginning to look well nigh inevitable. But whether or not this will increase rape convictions is, well, not proven."},{"url":null,"title":"budget-changes-are-not-enough-universal-credit-must-no-longer-ignore-hunger","story":"Some have argued that by not answering this question the UK Government is hiding bad news. The truth is much more worrying ndash it simply hasnrsquot looked.When I sit with people on Universal Credit, it is the administrative chaos that is most obvious. Journalists have reported on many horric cases, but it is the everyday pressures caused by delays, computer issues, documents going missing, as well as the ever-present threat of sanctions, that reveal just how badly this system is failing many families.Universal Creditrsquos architects, the Centre for Social Justice and Iain Duncan Smith, have argued that it is spending cuts that have caused the problems. They have a point. Yet while the Budget partly reversed one of these cuts, Universal Credit bears the scars of eight years of cutbacks with much more planned.Churches, charities and claimants themselves have repeatedly said that Universal Credit leads many towards financial crisis and even hunger. The UK Government has vigorously rejected these claims, but has never backed this up with direct evidence.A Government survey of claimants showed that  in  families were struggling. In response the head of the Universal Credit programme admitted that the survey design means itrsquos not possible to tellUniversal Credit makes things better or worse. In the words of the National Audit Office, the DWP ldquodoes not know how many claimants are having problems withor have suffered hardship.William Beveridge designed the current benefit system  years ago with the express intention of ending poverty, or in his words the ldquogiant evil of ldquoWant. Today, the purpose of Universal Credit is very dferent.The purpose of Universal Credit is made clear in DWP documents that describe how the systemrsquos success or failure is judged. It aims to increase employment by \"changing the behaviours and attitudes of low-income families.Questions around families being able to cope, experiencing hardship or needing to use foodbanks simply do not appear. There is however copious data about peoplersquos job searches and their attitudes to work.The result is thatyou ask how strongly claimants agree with the statement \"any job is better than none the DWP can give you full and detailed answers. Ask whether those same families can feed their children and the silence will be deafening.A benefit system is always a balancing act between competing principles. Overall cost, incentivising work and ensuring that families have enough money have always been set against each other. Universal Credit strikes a new balance emphasising lower costs and work incentives. These necessarily come at the expense of providing an adequate income.Churches are seeing some of the human consequences of this new balance. Some impacts, such as the run on foodbanks, can be counted. We also hear stories of families needing help to get nappies for newborns, or unwell folk walking for hours to get to the Jobcentre because they cannot afford a bus.Today these peoplersquos experiences are being brushed under the carpet ndash but it is these peoplersquos voices that must be heardwe are to stop Universal Credit pushing families towards foodbanks.The Budget announcement of a few billion and further delays will not rescue Universal Credit.A properly funded ing benefit system has the potential to enable people held back by poverty to reach their full potential. However, this is impossible in families that are simply focusing on finding their next meal. The principle of preventing hardship must be reintroduced.Universal Credit needs a comprehensive overhaul where genuine poverty experts ndash those who face poverty every day ndash are included in the process. This is not an impractical pipe dream ndash Scotlandrsquos experience  are already helping design the new Scottish Social Security System.I do not know what the result of such a redesign would be but I do know that by tackling hunger and listening to those affected by the benefit system we have a much better chance of releasing the enormous potential that Universal Credit increasingly locks away.Rev Dr Richard Frazer is the Convener of the Church of Scotlandrsquos Church and Society Council"},{"url":null,"title":"real-slice-of-italy-baked-pizza-al-taglio-glasgow-reviewed-by-ron-mackenna","story":"GlasgowOK, they donrsquot have the pizza that our kids always used to have in Italy.

So we immediately order four slices of what is a family favourite.Itrsquos usually the last piece of Italian food we eat in Italy every summer as we stop off at one of the once-great-now-sadly-not-so-good Autogrills that line the autostrade before the culinary bleakness of Switzerland.We order tonight, too, a few squares of Calabrian sausage and onion a prosciutto, straciatella and fig jam pear and gorgonzola.Delight is probably the best way to describe our first reaction to a pizza al taglio take-away-with-seats opening in Glasgowrsquos east end. On Duke Street, in fact, just opposite Tennents Brewery.Surprise is probably our second reaction. Why  Witness this. We gaze at the plump, freshly-baked, attractive-looking squares seductively laid out on racks at the counter. We ooh and ahh over which of the many exotic toppings wersquore going to have. We order what we want.Then we gape when it turns out those squares have hard-to-notice cuts on them and actually theyrsquore not squares at all but subided into long rather thin rectangles.Aah, theyrsquore half the size then of those that are usually served at al taglio ndash or by-the-slice places ndash in rural Italy where a euro a slice of margherita is still possible.Part of the joy of eating there is simply to have a huge, slobbery, delicious piece of warm baked goodness in the hand. Hold hard though. Allowance has to be made here for the amount of exotic toppings, the transporting across borders, Glasgow prices and, er novelty.And in all fairness pizza al taglio is very expensive in places like Romersquos Pizzarium Di Bonci which often tops the Italian Gambero Rosso guide. Although Baked here is based on Romersquos fashionable al taglio joints, much humbler al taglio is available theand breadth of the country in little bakers who do nothing  but turn out trays of delicious, crusty, creamy pizza that are usually bought by weight.The best Irsquove ever had was much further north in Varese, maybe  years ago. I can still taste its amazing creaminess, but I remember too as a kid being with my Nonna in a small town in Molise where we arrived at an al taglio just as the pizza margherita tray came out the oven. We stood and ate them from greaseproof paper right away.Anyway, whatrsquos the pizza like here  It must be good, Irsquom thinking, because itrsquos .pm on a Sunday night, theyrsquore closing in a few minutes yet therersquos a steady stream through the door.And, generally, it is good. We have slices of the last baked tray from the oven. Margharita ndash thick, puffed up, richly crusted, maybe a little bready but undeniably fresh.The sausage and onion that Cal and Seona share is as it should be. The potato pizza has finely sliced, crisply-edged slices but maybe lacks seasoning. There are more rectangles to taste and try, all exhibiting the Roman style of pizza toppings as art.Maybe a bit more work on the bases, which y in rise, but as we arrived near to closing time there was only that margharita available still hot from the bake. Better to check again when theyrsquore in full flow.There are two rice balls stuffed with cheese too, suppli to you and me, pre-fried and then, because the fryer is now off, reheated in an oven. Not hugely successfully.Therersquos a moment of excitement at a pepperonata topped slice with actual still-rare-in-Scottish-restaurants stracchino, but it turns out to have been substituted with burrata ndash a less pugnacious Italian cheese.

Now his successor is telling us he felt moved to resign from his post because he could not support the document for which he had been chiefly responsible. Of course we now know that there have been more sightings of Lord Lucan in Brussels these past two years than of this hapless pair. And then therersquos the draft withdrawal agreement itself where the name of every country in the world is mentioned save those of Scotland and Freedonia.In February, , the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, made a speech in London in which he spoke about how the rest of the UK would be diminishedScotland were to leave. He said: ldquoThe UK is the big European success story of this century moving from an island sinking under too much debt, too much borrowing and too much taxation to a country thatrsquos dynamic, exporting, innovating, creating. Scotland is right at the heart of that vision.Not even the most fervent of Scottish Unionists could have predicted how quickly Scotland would fall out of the picture. When Mrs May was taken to task at the absence of any mention of Scotland in the -page document she replied that this wasnrsquot necessary as Scotland was part of the United Kingdom. Few in the SNP were expecting anything more than this and certainly not Mike Russell, formerly the Scottish Governmentrsquos Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotlandrsquos Place in Europe. Earlier this year he spoke to me about some of his frustrations in this role. These principally arose from the large number of joint ministerial meetings that were cancelled by the UK Government during his tenure. You couldnrsquot even accuse the UK Government of treating Scotland with contempt during the Brexit process. To treat someone with contempt you must at least engage with them.Such contempt as the UK Government has shown to Scotland has never been in evidence in its dealings with Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionist Party. That relationship was founded on a bribe of hard cash and is maintained in the same way that rich Victorians once conducted illicit relationships with the domestic staff. Thus, ten representatives of a gerrymandered region created for the sole purpose of reinforcing the cultural superiority of one people over another, were able to take ownership of the entire Brexit process. It remains to be seen what further financial inducements the British state will slip furtively into the hands of the DUP to secure their support for the draft agreement.Accompanying every interview across each of the UKrsquos main television and radio news channels these last three days a persistent drumbeat could be heard. Its message never ceased: ldquoTaking back control of our borders taking back control of our laws. It was espoused by Tory Brexiteers and Remainers alike. Itrsquos easy to forget that they only disagree on minutiae and that they all coalesce around the same over-arching principles: that all dodgy foreigners must be kept out and that the industrial relations enjoyed by th century mill-owners must be regained.The Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris also featured heavily in the political coverage. In , she was one of  landlord MPs who voted down an amendment on rental homes being ldquofit for human habitation. She and her financier husband once featured in a newspaper series about how affluent families could ldquolimit their tax liabilities. On Wednesday night she said that of course Brexit would be ldquobumpy without admitting that it would be somewhat smoother for her. Itrsquos the same approach deployed by her spiritual mentor in the European Research Group, Mr Rees-Mogg who last month said that the ramications of Brexit might not be known for  years. Only people with very large fortunes and estates can speak with such insouciance about actions and their consequences.What we have witnessed these last few days isnrsquot really about the entire future of the UK as the BBCrsquos Laura Kuenssberg pronounced with solemn gravity. Itrsquos about what happens when a small group of the UKrsquos richest and most powerful people quarrel about how best to maintain their hegemony.

It came against expectations at Westminster.When, on Thursday night, the Environment Secretary turned down the role of Brexit Secretary because Mrs May had refused his request to be able to change the draft deal, it seemed the writing was on the wall.How,Mr Gove thought the deal needed to be renegotiated, could he possibly carry on Having been the \"assassin\" for his onetime chums Cameron and Johnson, what would it have said for his capacity for loyaltythe Scot had wielded the kne a third time By rallying round, Mr Gove helped shore up support for Mrs May, preventing the likes of fellow Brexiteers, Mordaunt, Grayling and Leadsom handing in their resignations.Next week, the PM faces yet another challenge: the threat of a no-confidence vote. But the rebels, having expressed initial confidence they have the  signatures needed to spark a vote, appear increasingly dfident they can secure one.AndMrs May won any vote, her detractors could not challenge her for another year.Tory whips will be busy this week ringing round colleagues, warning them against joining the rebellion, saying it could end with an even greater disaster: a Corbyn government.Intriguingly, while London and Brussels have been adamant there can be no renegotiation of the draft agreement, Leave ministers like Gove, Leadsom, Mordaunt and Grayling are set to meet next week to seethey can push the Brexit door open a bit. There is even talk of the Pizza-clubbers Hunt, Hammond and Javid joining forces in the campaign.The aim is to change the current backstop exit mechanism, which has so antagonised the pro-Brexiteers namely, the UK can only leave the backstop with the EUrsquos say-so.The argument isthis could be amended in some way to allow ndash what in all other walks of le happens ndash free will so Britain could walk away at the moment of its choosing, then the draft deal just might make it through the parliamentary quagmire.At present, the prospect of the draft deal getting through the Commons looks hopeless. It had been thought Mrs May could, given the tranche of Leave and Remain rebels, possibly rely on Labour moderates to push the Brexit withdrawal blueprint over the line.But the Labour moderates as well as the opposition forces as a whole believethe May deal is rejected, Britainrsquos sovereign Parliament could ldquotake charge and propose another vote with the option of staying in.This is why the PM this week dropped into the public consciousness the three-way choice of her deal, a no-deal or a no Brexit.As Labour figures begin to use more positive language about a Peoplersquos Vote, the SNP appear to be warming to it greatly too.Yet, of course, there is also the little matter of indyref and when Nicola Sturgeon will make her big demand.Earlier this week, much to the chagrin of some of her parliamentary colleagues, the First Minister again adopted a wait-and-see position even though we now know the broad terms of the draft withdrawal agreement.It seems clear, politically, Ms Sturgeon will make her call on the back of what she feels is the moment of maximum disruption for the Tory Government, which, at present, looks like the aftermath of the meaningful vote at Westminster.But, everything to do with Brexit is a gamble.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Saturday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amThe nomination period for the  Orkney Sports Awards remains open.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services.

I wasn’t prepared to cancel my constituency commitments at such short notice for @scotgov to yet again have to hear empty platitudes rather than be listened to .” Ms Sturgeon told MSPs at Holyrood yesterday that she will set out her plans to stage a second referendum on independence when the outcome of the current Brexit deal is finalised. But Westminster has authority over the constitution and the UK Government has so far ruled out the prospect of a second referendum being staged. : Sturgeon: EU could negotiate new dealMay’s plan is rejected“I don’t see any sign of the UK Government’s approach changing. We feel that that issue was settled when the Scottish people voted last time round. It was going to be, I thinkMr Salmond said once in a generation opportunityto resolve he independence question.“I’m not a Scot so I speak with caution about Scottishthings but what I read in your papers and when I dip into your broadcasts is grave concern in Scotland about the health service, about school standards, about productivity and growth and I would’ve though there’s plenty of work for the Scottish Government to be doing there.”The SNP leader has stated that her MPs will vote against the Brexit deal struck this week because it freezes Scotlnad out of the EU single market and customs union, butMr Lidington applealed for a sht in this position.“Overall this is a package that will work for the prosperity and security for everybody in Scotland and for everybody in the whole of the UK.“There will be an important choice for the Scottish Government and for Scottish members of Parliament at Westminster.“Employers in all sectors want a deal and they want the stability and the certainty and the clarity that that will bring “I hope very mich that despite the dferences that do exist and which I respect that the First Miniser will in the end decide to put the interests of Scottish business and living standards and prosperity in Scotland first and support this deal.”And he warned it’s a case of “take it or leave it” over the deal, despite Ms Sturgeon suggestions last night that a better agreement could still be negotiated.“It’s become very clear from what Chancellor Merkel has said and from that Édouard Philippe the French Prime Minister has said that this is the deal that is on offer,” he added.“And that they have both have said very plainly that they are simply not going to go back, after the months that has been spent in negotiating this compromise, to reopen this and start again.“What we have on the table is a package which offers really good prospects for business, for employment, investment Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4830590.1542306308!/image/image.jpg","title":"alastair dalton what edinburgh s new 100 seat monster buses say about public transport","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The unveiling ceremony had the razzmatazz reminiscent of the launch of a new train favoured by the likes of Sir Richard Branson of Virgin, writes Alastair Dalton.There had been little clue in the invitation of what was in store – simply that a new bus had been built for Lothian which would give “signicant benefits” to passengers.Heralded by a bagpiper, what emerged from behind a curtain at the Alexander Dennis factory in Falkirk turned out to be not only Lothian’s biggest ever but the largest in the UK.Confounding past gloom in the industry caused by the vicious circle of falling passenger numbers and growing urban congestion, this -strong fleet of -seater double deckers seemed like a massive vote of confidence in the future of the bus.It could be a win for Scottish manufacturing too, since the Falkirk firm hasn’t made buses in volume for Lothian for decades.Since the announcement last week, the operator has been surprisingly reticent about the new vehicles, which are due to debut in late January.However, it seems a key motivator has been the ability to better cope with rush-hour demand without having to put more vehicles on the road which would just add to the traffic.On the face of it, you might think such monsters would mean even more empty seats at quieter times, but what Lothian appears to be banking on is introducing a further improvement in passenger comfort to entice more people out of their cars.: Monster buses coming to Edinburgh will be the UK’s biggestFeatures already on its other buses like wi and charging sockets will be accompanied by “mood lighting” to create a better ambience and high-back seats to give passengers more personal space.However, the new buses are not electric, in a reflection that the industry has some way to go towards zero-emission vehicles.Lothian is about to be joined by west coast counterparts First Glasgow in trialling electric buses, but I’m told they are still too expensive and can’t travel far enough between charges to yet be unormly viable.Scotland’s first emission zone comes into force in Glasgow city centre in less than seven weeks’ time on New Year’s Day, with Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee to follow within four years. Buses will be the initial target of the pollution crackdown, with an increasing proportion having to have the cleanest diesel engines to use the zone.For First Glasgow, clean diesel, rather than electric, is the “only show in town” when electrics can only manage  miles before having being charged for four hours, when a typical route involves  miles a day.: Alastair Dalton: Failure to curb cars in cities is throttling busesIt said electric buses were three times the price of diesel ones, at about £, each, and you would never recoup the dference in lower running costs.But the worry must be that while the technology is evolving, there could be repeats of the situation in Glasgow, where its only electric service was threatened with closure because the cost of supporting it become prohibitive for the city council after the four-year-old vehicles’ warranty ran out.Electric buses are smoother and will cut pollution where it matters, such as around passengers waiting at bus stops.But there are likely to be a number of jolts to come on the road to buses becoming greener as well as more attractive to passengers.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4830460.1542310923!/image/image.jpg","title":"kevan christie tv bosses discover formula to make us all get netflix anxiety disorder","story":"Netflix Anxiety Disorder # the social pressure to watch TV box sets # has replaced obsessional interest in music and trainers as the way to define whether you are cool or not, writes Kevan Christie.“Have you seen Killing Eve yet  You should watch it - you’ll love it. Yeah, you can download the lot on BBC iPlayer.” Fast forward one week ... ”Have you watched Killing Eve  I’m telling you – you’ve got to watch it ... you’ll love it. Watch Killing Eve.”The above passive-aggressive conversation or similar is being played out in offices, cafes and pubs across the country anytime two or more friends get together for a catch-up and a break from the daily grind.The problem is that as soon as you’ve watched the eight episodes of female psychopath drama Killing Eve as ordered, your telly tormentor will be onto the next ‘must see’ show.So, by the time you’re ready to have the Killing Eve conversation – they’ll be smugly telling anyone who’ll listen to watch the latest series of Inside No  on BBC – “it’s genius”.If none of this makes sense to you and you’re asking what Killing Eve is, don’t worry you’re fine. You fall into the category of ... perfectly normal human being and who might even spend time outdoors.If, however, you’re cancelling social engagements, gym appointments and the flu jab in the hope of getting ill, so as to make time for ‘box-setting’ then you’ve got a problem and are showing the first symptoms of a fledgling illness, let’s call it Netflix Anxiety Disorder .This obsession with television in the form of box sets is the new cool for those of us who care about such things.In my day, it was what music you were into and what trainers you wore to stand outside the chippy that mattered and woe betide anyone who turned up in the school playground wearing Adidas Kicks instead of Samba. The Face magazine was our bible and everyone dressed like a golfer on acid.: The most exciting TV dramas still to come this yearGo back to the s and it was the album under your arm that defined you – Roxy Music, Bowie or Steely Dan good, anything by The Wurzels bad.But now, the all-consuming television or ‘idiot box’ as it was once known is calling the shots and heaven forbid that you’re one of those relics who still watches terrestrial TV in chronological order – Bic Biro pen at the ready waiting to circle preferred programmes in the paper.At this point, I have to admit to I’m exhibiting the classic symptoms of NAD. I’ve found myself getting anxiousmy TV planner has less than  per cent capacity left for recording programmes. It’s the same feeling I get when running low on milk or sticking the last piece of bread in the toaster. I also worry that I’ve not got enough Maltesers in my chocolate stash to see me through a marathon box set sesh.To compound the problem, my planner is full of stuff I’ve taped – yes, I still say taped – but know I’ll never watch.This is made up of programmes I watched as a child and still feel nostalgic about – The World at War and the Rockford Files being two examples, although I reckon this is down to the theme tunes.: Dani Garavelli: Killing Eve heralds new lease of leThere’s also a fair chunk of pretentious stuff that I know I’ll never watch but I have taped in the faint hope it might improve me as a person.This includes the Art of France, Germany and Scandinavia, Jean-Luc Godard’s classic  French New Wave drama Vivre sa Vie, starring Anna Karina and the sublime  film noir Crime Wave, starring Sterling Hayden and Charles Bronson, directed by Andre De Toth. This was referenced by the great Stanley Kubrick in his film The Killing. I know all of this useless information because it comes up in blue every time I scroll through my TV planner to see what I’ve taped – before scrolling back to watch Ballers starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson. To my knowledge, Ballers hasn’t been referenced in any classic film noirs but it’s early days.Such is my TV planner anxiety, I’m thinking of putting a note in a will telling my we to delete the  episodes of the Rockford Files that I’ve taped in the event of my passing.The last thing I’d want is for a grieving widow to run out of TV planner space.Don’t get me wrong – I totally understand the benefits of being able to pause the telly while you nip to the loo or make a cup of tea.But there’s definitely a formula to these types of shows, an alchemy that draws us in and keeps us coming back series after series. I know it involves the unexpected death of a main character having learnt that from The Sopranos and The Wire but the rest is as yet a mystery.At this point, I have to ask, does anyone go the pictures anymore Could it be that we’re going through one of those dark periods for cinema, much like  years ago when television was king and movies took a backseat as picture houses started to close  If so, this is a shame.I cherish the memory of Friday,  October,  – the date Goodfellas had its UK cinema release. I remember that day like it was yesterday. I took a half day from my job as a Visual Display Unitoperator with Standard Le to head up to the Dominion  on my own to watch the Scorsese classic. I bought my box – it has to be a box of fruit gums – and sat through two hours  minutes of sheer unadulterated psychopathic joy. Just me and one other person in that tiny art deco theatre, watching Joe Pesci ask menacingly: “I’m funny how, I mean funny like a clown ” At the last count I’ve watched it  times ... it was on TCM again last week – and I’ve now added it to my TV planner.Oh, and just in case, Netflix Anxiety Disorder is not a real illness.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831310.1542405651!/image/image.jpg","title":"return of ally rudd as may tries to ride out brexit coup attempt","story":"Theresa May has moved to stabilise her government in the midst of a coup attempt by Brexiteers, bringing a close ally back into Cabinet and taking personal control of negotiations with Brussels.Yesterday’s calculated moves followed Michael Gove’s decision to throw the Prime Minister a leline by not quitting over the terms of her draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, after  hours spent considering his position.Brexiteers insisted they had the numbers to trigger a vote of no-confidence in Mrs May’s leadership that could come as early as Tuesday, but by last night there was no formal announcement that the threshold of  MPs calling for her to stand down had been reached.:How a no-confidence vote would unfold for PM Theresa MayNew voices of dissent brought the number of ­publicly confirmed letters to the chairman of the backbench  Committee to  yesterday.Steve Baker, one of the ringleaders, said after speaking to fellow MPs: “My count is a little over  with perhaps another dozen probables.”: Nicola Sturgeon told to forget independence referendum by Theresa May’s deputyHe later appeared to step back from claiming the threshold had already been reached, saying: “I think we are approaching the moment.”The weekend is being seen as crucial to the development of the coup, with a failure to collect enough supporters by early next week raising questions over whether Brexiteers can force Mrs May from office.Conservative whips were told to cancel their plans andto Westminster to be briefed by the chief whip, signalling a Downing Street charm offensive by telephone while MPs are in their constituencies over the weekend to stave off the possibility of a confidence vote.At the end of one of the most challenging weeks of her premiership, Mrs May was spared a final, probably fatal blow by the Environment Secretary’s decision to stay on in government despite deep reservations over the draft withdrawal deal.Askedhe had confidence in the Prime Minister, Mr Gove said: “I absolutely do.”He added: “I am looking forward to continuing to work with all colleagues in government and in Parliament to get the best future for Britain.”A Downing Street spokeswoman said Mrs May was “very pleased” Mr Gove would stay on and “continue doing the important work he is doing”. There was also support from Brexiteer Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who said he had “full confidence in the Prime Minister” and added: “What we need now is stability.”And in a marked departure from Mrs May’s “no deal is better than a bad deal” mantra, he told an event in Bristol: “Ultimately I hope that across Parliament we’ll recognise that a deal is better than no deal.”However, there were signs that the Brexiteers remaining in Cabinet could continue to work against the Prime Minister behind the scenes. There were reports Mr Gove and Mr Fox would meet with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom to discuss how to push for concessions on the issue of the Irish border backstop.Mrs May sought to shore up her position by bringing one of her closest allies back into government, appointing Amber Rudd as Work and Pensions Secretary.The Prime Minister has also taken personal control of Brexit negotiations with Brussels, appointing a junior figure as Brexit Secretary to oversee domestic preparations for leaving the EU.Stephen Barclay, a former whip and junior minister at the Treasury and Department of Health, takes over from Dominic Raab, who sparked chaos by resigning on Thursday over the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement.There is just over a week left until a planned special EU summit to sign off the UK’s “orce deal”, and finalise a political declaration setting the direction of travel for future trade talks.Downing Street said this would be handled by the Prime Minister and UK officials in Brussels.In a statement, Downing Street declined to say whether the Brexit Secretary post had been offered to anyone  before the North-East Cambridgeshire MP, following reports Mr Gove and the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox had both turned it down, saying only: “He was the Prime Minister’s choice for the job.”Ms Rudd, who stood in for the Prime Minister in televised debates during the  election campaign, resigned as Home Secretary in April over the Windrush scandal.Asked what Mrs May would say to victims of the Windrush scandal who might feel the Hastings  Rye MP’s rehabilitation had come too soon, the PM’s official spokesman said: “The government has apologised, the Prime Minister and Home Secretary apologised for the Windrush scandal … work is ongoing to make sure those people are properly compensated.”Yesterday the Prime Minister had a taste of some of the bewilderment at the deal while taking questions on a morning radio phone-in programme, with one caller telling her she had “appeased” the EU like Neville Chamberlain in his negotiations with Hitler.Another claimed Jacob Rees-Mogg would make a better leader.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831254.1542396846!/image/image.jpg","title":"rudd urged to ditch dwp policies after damning un report","story":"The new Department for Work and Pensions secretary has been urged to reverse the work of her predecessors, after the impact of UK policies in Scotland was branded #outrageous# by a UN official.Amber Rudd MP was given the post on Friday after Esther McVey MP quit in a row over the Brexit deal.Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, toured the UK last week and announced his preliminary findings in a report on Friday.: ‘Alex Salmond paid £k from his company while crowdfunding legal challenge’He was scathing of UK Government policy, accusing ministers of being “in a state of denial” over the extent of poverty in the Britain, leading to criticism of UK policy from Scotland’s Communities Secretary.Professor Alston said devolved administrations have tried to mitigate the worst impacts of austerity, despite constitutional and financial constraints.He wrote: “The UK Government’s policies and drastic cuts to social support are entrenching high levels of poverty and inflicting unnecessary misery in one of the richest countries in the world.: Nicola Sturgeon told to forget independence referendum by Theresa May’s deputy“The experience of the United Kingdom, especially since , underscores the conclusion that poverty is a political choice.“Austerity could easily have spared the poor,the political will had existed to do so.“It is outrageous that devolved administrations need to spend resources to shield people from government policies.”Prof Alston highlighted Scottish Government schemes for addressing poverty, including its Fairer Scotland Action Plan.However, he said it is too soon to say whether such “ambitious steps” will make a dference in the country.Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: “This report is clear - it is the poorest and most vulnerable in our society who are being hit hardest.“I have repeatedly told the UK Government their failed policies are causing harm and poverty.“Now a UN Rapporteur has clearly outlined that changes are needed - once again I call on the UK Government to listen.“The next Secretary of State for Work and Pensions cannot act like their long line of predecessors.“From Universal Credit to sanctions, whoever takes on that job, must make the changes necessary to reverse the catalogue of cuts and damaging policies.”But a UK Government spokesman said Universal Credit is supporting people into work faster and they are listening to feedback.He added: “We completely disagree with this analysis.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#.

Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Saturday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated. Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”.

The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly.

Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our values.Will to Give added: Anyone can leave a gt in their will. It really doesnrsquot matter what size ndash small or large, every gt is greatly received.It is very easy to leave a gt in yourwill to charity ndash in fact, hundreds of people do it every year in Northern Ireland. We will always advise you to speak with your solicitor to have your will drafted correctly. Your solicitor should be familiar with how to write such a gt into your will.Further informationWill to Give is a charity dedicated to promoting charitable gts in Wills in Northern Ireland.

Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre. The project is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.I used to be a childminder and had two young children and didnrsquot think it was possible for me to get into the beauty business - but then I went back to college and studied beauty at the Roberta Mechan College, she said.I have a real interest in health and well-being and wanted to offer these services to others. I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

Mistakes were made which shouldn’t have taken place and work is ongoing to make sure those people are properly compensated.”The spokesman said the PM viewed Ms Rudd as “a very experienced Secretary of State who has worked across a number of departments” and was “confident she will do an excellent job”.Speaking outside his departmental office, Environment Secretary Mr Gove was askedhe had confidence in the Prime Minister and replied: “I absolutely do.”He added: “I am looking forward to continuing to work with all colleagues in Government and in Parliament to get the best future for Britain.”A Downing Street spokeswoman said Mrs May was “very pleased” that Mr Gove will stay on and “continue doing the important work he is doing”.Mrs May also won support from Brexiteer Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who said he had “full confidence in the Prime Minister” and added “ultimately I hope that across Parliament we’ll recognise that a deal is better than no deal”.But Brexit-supporting ministers led by Andrea Leadsom are reportedly set to work together on measures to make the deal more acceptable to them.The Commons Leader is understood to be working with allies to decide what can be done “to get it in a better place”, a source said.In an effort to sell her deal directly to the public, Mrs May took calls on a half-hour phone-in on LBC.One caller told the PM that Jacob Rees-Mogg would make a better leader, while another said she had “appeased” the EU like Neville Chamberlain in his negotiations with Hitler.Former culture secretary John Whittingdale and ex-minister Mark Francois were among the latest Tories to submit letters of no confidence in Mrs May as Conservative leader.The number of letters submitted to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the backbench  Committee, may now be nearing the  needed to trigger a vote.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said he had been speaking to colleagues and his count was “a little over ” with another dozen “probable” – although he acknowledged this may be inaccurate as only Sir Graham knew the true figure.If Mrs May is ousted, he said Brexiteers needed to agree on a single candidate to avoid the mistakes of the last leadership contest – evenit meant potentially deciding the next prime minister by drawing lots.But Mrs May’s de facto deputy David Lidington said she would “handsomely” win a confidence voteone was triggered by Tory MPs.The Prime Minister played down suggestions she might seek to maintain Cabinet unity by offering ministers a free vote when the Brexit deal comes before Parliament, as International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt has requested.“There is Cabinet collective responsibility in this country.

Matches between the two sides have historically proved contentious, with the November  clash in Belfast just one month after the Greysteel shooting and Shankill Road bombing remembered in infamy for the tension which surrounded it. Due to security concerns around the match the Republics players were flown to Belfast from Dublin, and the FAI - the football association for the Republic - took the decision to sell none of its ticket allocation.

We’re ready to fly,” she said. “I think what we learned from the inside in October was how safe this rocket was. “A lot of people called it an accident or an incident, or maybe want to use it as an example of not being safe. “But for us it’s exactly the opposite because our friends came home, the systems worked and they worked exactly as they were designed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry teenager type 1 diabetes praised role model young people","story":"If there’s one thing local teenager Harry Wilson is not short of while living with Type  diabetes over the past decade, it’s energy!Harry , who was diagnosed when he was four years old, plays an active role in helping to raise diabetes awareness and is a role model for young people coping with the condition.He is fully supported not just at home and in school but through the family business Click Energy which a year ago chose Diabetes UK Northern Ireland as its official charity for .The charity partnership selected by the Click Energy team, was inspired by seeing how well Harry, the son of Managing Director Damian Wilson, managed his diabetes from such a young age and show how you can still lead a normal le.Harry has also helped Diabetes UK Northern Ireland review guidance for young people managing the condition in school where they spend so much of their lives.He explained: “I have probably coped quite well because I’m used to having diabetes since I was four. It was more of a worry for my parents when I was diagnosed but it’s just part of everyday le now and as long as I stay on track managing it should be fine.”Harry is one of around seven pupils at his school with diabetes and as well as supporting each other they have the added support of classroom assistant Anne Beattie, the diabetes champion at St Joseph’s Boys’ School in Derry, who knows the complexities only too well as she is also Type , and staff member Rosin McLaughlin is always on hand to help as well. Harry knows how vital it is to check his blood sugar levels regularly and keep track of the carbs and he wears an insulin pump which he administers himself when required.Speaking ahead of World Diabetes Day on November th, the teenager said that while he had missed a lot of P and P following his diagnosis, there was now better awareness in schools about diabetes and help with monitoring blood sugars.He also reassured any young people newly diagnosed with the condition that they can still pursue the same hobbies as their friends, including competitive sports.Like most lads his age, Harry enjoys playing football, is also a good swimmer and golfs twice a week. With entrepreneurship in the genes, he’s already considering dipping his toe in the family business where his mum Martina also works in Customer Service.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshDamian Wilson, who founded Click Energy - Northern Ireland’s fastest growing electricity provider – in , said he was very proud that the eldest of their three children was a role model for young people with diabetes as a result of his own experience with the condition.“Harry is a very caring young man and diabetes hasn’t stood in his way,anything it has made him more headstrong and independent. He loves ‘The Apprentice’ and is a big fan of Sir Alan Sugar so hopefully he will start working here at  to gain some experience.”Currently, there are , people living with either Type  or Type  diabetes in Northern Ireland, and this figure is on the rise, making the need for education and awareness surrounding the condition more important than ever.People with Type  diabetes cannot produce insulin. About  per cent of people with diabetes have Type . No-one knows exactly what causes it, but it’s not to do with being overweight and it isn’t currently preventable. It’s the most common type of diabetes in children and young adults, starting suddenly and getting worse quickly. Type  diabetes is treated by daily insulin doses – taken either by injections or via an insulin pump. It is also recommended to follow a healthy diet and take regular physical activity.Jillian Patchett, National Director of Diabetes UK Northern Ireland, welcomed the partnership with Click Energy which included funding for pilot programmes including a new role for Connections Ambassadors to provide help and support in diabetes clinics and also the  Diabetes Volunteer Inspire Awards.She added: “The theme of World Diabetes Day  is Family. We know how important it is to have a network of family, friends, colleagues, class mates and healthcare professionals who are all there for support when it’s needed. We really appreciate all the help we receive and encourage everyone to continue to raise funds and awareness about this serious condition.”ABOVE - Damian Wilson, MD of Click Energy and his son

raised after residents of a street in Derry waited nine hours to have power restored to their homes after an underground cable was damaged.The incident happened at the Paddock Lane area in Ballyarnett at pm on Friday, which resulted in a number of homes experiencing a power loss.However, concerns have now been raised that it took NIE nine hours to restore power, given that many of those who live in the area are elderly.Commenting, the independent councillor for the area, Warren Robinson, said that while he understands that certain circumstances could delay power being restored, he was nonetheless concerned at how the issue was handled by NIE.“I was made aware of the problem after being contacted by some residents who were affected. “Concerns were raised in particular because this area houses a large proportion of elderly residents. “I immediately contacted NIE and was informed that a third party contractor had damaged a cable in the area and was told that a repair team were on site but NIE could not give me an estimate for when the fault would be repaired.”Cllr Robinson added: “I understand that sometimes circumstances may mean there is a delay in having repairs carried out but electricity was off in this area for ten hours and my concern would be that elderly residents were left with no information and no offers of help from NIE.”“NIE do have a duty of care to these customers, I believe they have a particular duty of care to our elderly neighbours. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“NIE need to tell us why it took ten hours for the repair to be carried

They also need to put measures in place wherebythere is a delay that this is immediately communicated to the affected residents.”Safety Responding, a spokesperson for NIE said that the efforts of engineers had been hampered by ‘adverse weather conditions’, adding that it had been dficult to provide customers with an exact time for when the issue would be resolved due to ‘complexity’ of the problem.“NIE Networks received reports of a fault at Paddock Lane at approximately pm on Friday, November ,” a spokesperson said. “An underground electricity cable had been accidentally damaged by a third-party contractor resulting in a small number of customers experiencing loss of electricity supply. “The damaged cable required isolation for safety reasons before engineers could begin to carry out repairs. The spokesperson continued: “We do endeavour to provide our customers with information where possible, however, it was dficult to provide an exact time for restoration on this occasion due to the unforeseen nature and complexity of the fault, as well as the safety required to undertake the repairs. “This was further compounded by our engineers operating in adverse weather conditions.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and

never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges. Such a body would provide the business community with a much-needed voice on a range of important issues.The series of roadshows to discuss parking charges moved to The Lodge in Castlewellan and the Newcastle Centre last night and takes place next Tuesday, November , at Ballynahinchrsquos Market House between .pm and .pm, before later moving to The Hub in Saintfield between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Symbolic lantern walk rekindles time WWI ended  ","story":"A SPECIALLY designed beacon was lit in Killyleagh on Sunday night to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.Local man Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, , one of Northern Irelandrsquos last survivors from the Second World War, lit the gas beacon of light at the front of Killyleagh Castle to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent.Mr Charters was accompanied by two local schoolchildren, Zac Gordon, from St Maryrsquos Primary School, Killyleagh, and Louise Craig, of Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The cross-community event was attended by more than  people at the end of Remembrance Sunday.The eveningrsquos events began with a lantern walk from Shrigley to Killyleagh.

best of both worlds brexit","story":"The author of a report, \"Brexit at the Border\", has said that the ldquopressure is on our political parties especially those with the influence of the DUPa \"best of both worlds\" brexit is to become a reality.Dr Katy Hayward, who is a Reader of Sociology at Queens and who has  years research experience on the impact of the EU on the Irish border and peace process, was responding to an article penned by DUP leader Arlene Foster in last weekrsquos Impartial Reporter.In that article Mrs Foster laid out what the ldquobest of both worlds would be for Northern Ireland, which included full access to UK single market, full access to the EU single market, and full access to future UK and EU trade deals.Mrs Foster said that no-one has offered this ldquobest of both worlds to Northern Ireland but Dr Hayward claims that it is possible but onlythe ldquoUK remains closely aligned to the EUrsquos single market andit stays in a customs union with the EU.Dr Hayward does not see a smooth path to any such scenario however.ldquoBut, as Mrs Foster is well aware, the most vocalMPs in the Tory party want the UK to have a far more remote relationship with the EU after Brexit. If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is the most immediate priority.”He continued: “And part of our agreement with the Conservative Party is the Brexit situation. So yes,the Conservative Party decided and were successful in getting this deal through the House of Commons then, absolutely, we will have to review our position with regard to the confidence and supply agreement.”His comments follow intense criticism of the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons yesterday.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds told the Prime Minister that despite numerous private meetings she had not listened to concerns.Theresa May was told her draft EU withdrawal agreement threatened the integrity of the UK and risked isolating Northern Ireland from the rest of the country.Mr Dodds said: “I could today stand here and take the Prime Minister through the list of promises and pledges that she made to this House and to us privately about the future of Northern Ireland and the future relationship with the EU but I fear it would be a waste of time since she clearly doesn’t listen.”Mr Dodds congratulated the Cabinet ministers who had so far resigned over the deal, adding: “The choice is now clear, we stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom or we vote for a vassal state.”The DUP’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said the deal was a case of “Northern Ireland being put on a platter as an object to surrender to the EU”.Ulster Rugby players to undergo Women’s Aid NI classes Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Politicians  Do we really care tuppence for them just now  Haven’t we seen and heard enough of them spitting venom over the ‘disaster’ ahead  Surely Brexit cannot be more important than the children in Yemen, dying daily in a ghastly war which shows no sign of abating, a war which like the one in Syria could go on for years  In the middle of the Christmas preparations we are faced with many such tragedies. But Brexit is dferent. It’s a war of bickering, a war destined to open up all our political weaknesses, a war which for the Irish and Northern Irish in particular is alarming in its bitterness and the need to settle old scores.Brexit is a drawn out battle we could have done without and I for one never imagined it would put a ‘damper’ on Christmas, a time of year when the charitable gene in us is thinking of other things and people. But politicians have hard hearts. Do they know it’s Christmas and do they care At this time each year we have Children in Need, which the UK as a whole continues to generously support. Going back much further to the s we had Band Aid, an event which really did capture the imagination thanks to the efforts of a pop star Bob Geldof Ben Lowry: Theresa May has ruthlessly but reluctantly felt she had to jettison unionism in Northern IrelandThe defeat of the EU withdrawal deal is the first imperative Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Yet, despite all our efforts children in many parts of the world continue to endure war and famine and what more can we do about it Regularly we put our hands in our purses in response to television and newspaper appeals but still it doesn’t appear to make much of a dference.Charities target us especially in the run-down to Christmas and I have no problem with that. In fact giving to charity is part of Christmas. Appeals are what we expect at this time of the year and people give generously. Our charity shops are full of beautul festive cards and gts to buy and many of us contribute in this way.But Brexit is getting in the way of all the festive spirit which can do so much good for those who need help. The politics of it all has me sapped, fed up, angry and vowing, at one stage, never to vote for a politician ever again. Did we get our fingers bitten back in the s when we signed up for the Common Market  Did we ever think when we signed then that we would end up being bossed around by a cabal of politicians speaking with foreign accents who dare us to withdraw from the ghastly behemoth they created due to our own politicians not reading the fine print or having the brains to see the problems that might arise in our attempt to extricate ourselves.Here I am in the midst of wondering what height my Christmas tree should be, distracted by the possibility that Sinn Fein could well be celebrating that their wildest dream of a united Ireland may be that bit closer come December. My mind is also distracted by the worry that the DUP, their reputation as kingmakers long gone, will be outwitted by the English politicians who really don’t give a toss about us and would gladly see us unhooked and driven into the Irish sea leaving them to become little England again.Soon I will dispatch Himself into the roof space to unearth the Christmas decorations an event I usually celebrate with a glass of my home made sloe gin. But Brexit is well and truly knocking the Christmas spirit out of me. try catch     .               ..

Barclay. The reshuffle came just hours after Michael Gove offered the Prime Minister a leline by staying on in his Cabinet role.Environment Secretary Mr Gove insisted he still has confidence in Mrs May who has suffered a series of setbacks following the publication of her draft Brexit deal with Brussels.She has suffered the loss of four ministers and faces continued speculation that a vote of no confidence in her leadership could be triggered by Tory MPs within days.Ms Rudd was a prominent Remain campaigner during the referendum and herto the Cabinet, in place ofBrexiteer Esther McVey who resigned on Thursday, may do little to bridge ides within the Tory ranks.\" title\"Amber Rudd has made a shockto the cabinet. \" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Stud-1.jpg","title":"plans to build  new homes in co antrim","story":"Posted on Wednesday  November  by John Mulgrew Around , new homes could be built in Co Antrim in one of the largest developments to take place here in the last few years, it can be revealed. Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town. The Ballyclare-based developer is now expected to progress to a more detailed plan for the housing scheme.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/may_1.jpg","title":"the brexit draft agreement business reaction","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew The publication of a draft agreement between the Prime Minister and Brussels over the UK’s exit has caused a huge stir among the political institutions. Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
