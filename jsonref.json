Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Debt-for-equity solution to personal insolvency situation would have set precedentOwner feels he is being \u0026lsquobullied\u0026rsquo off board for questioning levying of remedial chargesDrugs trade moving out of recession as new younger gangs flex muscleWill a murder conviction handed down by a European ally not be recognised here?High Court told publisher has withdrawn bid for personal insolvency arrangementAudits reveal hospitals not complying with waiting-list management protocolUnprecedented backing puts Greens in line to secure seats in all European constituenciesKevin Hynes (56) was part of a group attempting to scale the mountain\u0026rsquos summitVoting on Friday took place in more than 6,500 polling stations across the countryBottlenecks of climbers pose extra challenge to those taking on Mount EverestPilot sustained bruising following incident that took place near Devlin last JuneSinead Lay was 14 when she was groomed and sexually assaulted by Fergus DelaneyFormer chief constable of Cheshire Police takes up job when George Hamilton retiresParty faces a challenge to consolidate its 2014 success in local elections, says FF leaderFine Gael makes complaint to garda\u0026iacute amid surge in number of postal votes in SligoHundreds of dogs and horses rescued in \u0026euro59,000 operation which took nine daysLight makes it harder to see true beauty of the night sky, says local teacher"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3903682.1558727705!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cork homeowners urged to secure cars as garda%C3%AD search for burglars from dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGardaí in Fermoy were alerted when a homeowner discovered three men breaking into his house in Glanworth  at around 9.30am, he was knocked to the ground by the gang as they fled to a waiting gold coloured Volvo driven by a fourth man.Gardaí in North Cork have urged homeowners to be vigilant and to secure their cars as they mounted a major search operation for a travelling criminal gang who were disturbed as they broke into a house in the area early on Friday morning.Gardaí in Fermoy were alerted when a homeowner discovered three men breaking into his house in Glanworth near Fermoy at around 9.30am. He was knocked to the ground by the gang as they fled to a waiting gold coloured Volvo driven by a fourth man.The homeowner, who is in his late 30s was uninjured and immediately alerted and Gardaí from Fermoy began a search for the gold coloured Volvo while they also alerted colleagues in Mallow and other surrounding districts to be on the lookout for the gangGardaí from Mallow came upon the gold colour Volvo near Quartertown on the south western outskirts of Mallow and the gang abandoned the car and fled on foot into fields near Dromahane as gardai mounted a major search operation.HidingGardaí received a tip off that the gang were hiding in a field where silage was being cut and they began to close in but three of the gang managed to elude gardaí and head off on foot in a south westerly direction towards high ground around Bweeng.However gardaí managed to catch one of the gang, a 17-year-old youth from Tallaght hiding in a drain and he was brought for questioning to Fermoy Garda Station where he is detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act which allows gardaí detain suspects for up to 24 hours.Gardaí also removed the gold coloured Volvo to a secure location and garda technical experts are carrying out a forensic examination for fingerprints and DNA evidence to help identify the other gang members while officers are also investigating whether the car may have been stolen.Officers believe the gang travelled from Tallaght down the N8 late on Thursday night with a view to carrying out a spate of burglaries in North Cork only for their plans to be foiled when they were disturbed by the homeowner in Glanworth.A Garda spokesman tonight urged homeowners in North Cork, and particularly in the Bweeng and Glantane areas, to check to make sure their property including their cars are secure as they believe the gang may try and steal a car to try and elude gardaí and get back to Tallaght.Gardaí are also monitoring a number of known criminals in the greater Cork area with whom it’s suspected that the Tallaght gang have links and to whom they may turn for assistance in an effort to get them out of Cork and back to their west Dublin base.Post Office raidMeanwhile in an unrelated matter, Gardaí in Cork city are continuing to question two men in their 30s arrested on Thursday for questioning in connection with an armed robbery at Little Island Post Office in East Cork early on Thursday morning.Two masked raiders, one armed with a handgun and the other armed with an iron bar burst into the Post Office in Trafford Park in Little island and threatened staff before making off with a small sum of cash in a black Ford Mondeo.Gardaí began a search operation and arrested one man in the Glanmire area and arrested a second in the Knocknaheeny area on Thursday afternoon and brought both to Mayfield Garda Station where they are detained under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3903667.1558726725!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"developer seeks removal of private owner from board","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCearbhall Beggan, who lives in Cathedral Court on Clanbrassil Street, Dublin. Photograph: Aidan CrawleyThe developer of a Dublin apartment complex with building defects is seeking the removal of the only private owner from the board of the owners’ management company (OMC).The  revealed this week that Sherborough Enterprises, a development company controlled by members of the family that owns the O’Callaghan hotel group, expects apartment owners at Cathedral Court in Dublin 8 to pay more than €5,000 each to repair building defects in an apartment block that it built and still partly owns.A building surveyor’s report found problems with a large number of balconies at the site in 2016, while a fire safety survey last year also found a number of fire-stopping shortcomings.Cearbhall Beggan is the only private owner and volunteer director on the board of the Cathedral Court OMC the only other director is Paul O’Callaghan, son of hotelier Noel O’Callaghan and director of Sherborough.Mr Beggan said yesterday he feels he is now being “bullied” off the board for questioning the rationale behind charging private owners for the remediation of building defects rather than pursuing the developer first.In February, before any private owners were made aware of the issues, Paul O’Callaghan informed Mr Beggan that Sherborough Enterprises had already carried out defect remediation works on the three penthouse apartments it owned and expected the €15,000 cost of this to be paid out of the management company’s sinking fund.When Mr Beggan, on behalf of the OMC, questioned why private owners would pay for the work instead of pursuing the developer, Mr O’Callaghan responded to say: “I suggest you go get legal advice as we will be heading to court if you think the suggestion of yours is happening.”He also said that if no compelling legal advice contrary to their own was found, Sherborough Enterprises would use its majority vote at an egm to push through the remediation levy on all owners.Blocked voteIn April 2019 Mr Beggan was chair of an egm where he blocked a vote that would introduce a €5,300 levy on every apartment owner to remediate fire-safety and balcony defects because “members had not been fully informed and the resolution inherently accepted without discussion that the OMC would pay for the work”.Mr Beggan also blocked a vote proposing Charles O’Callaghan, brother of Paul, be added as a director of the OMC.It was only after this egm was held, where both votes were blocked, that Sherborough Enterprises requested Mr Beggan be removed from the board of OMC.In a letter, issued to all owners on May 16th last, the company said it wished to “express our complete displeasure with the performance of the board of the OMC for Cathedral Court” and that “we feel our rights as a member of the OMC are being suppressed”.The letter states that the work required on the balconies “are primarily due to the fact that absolutely no maintenance from day one was carried out by the OMC and not due to defective work as alleged”.However, the building surveyors report from McGovern O’Brien in February 2016 states: “It is clear that there is poor workmanship and detailing and untreated timbers are contributing to the defects, as 50 per cent of the balconies inspected are showing signs of accelerated deterioration of the timber sub frames”.The  understands that following the distribution of this letter a number of private owners came forward to defend Mr Beggan and the voluntary work he has done for the OMC over the last number of years.‘Never a problem’Mr Beggan said: “I have worked in a voluntary capacity for the board of Cathedral Court for the last seven years. Over that time I’ve worked on many efficiencies and improvements, including reducing electricity and heating bills and have made estimated savings of over €350,000.“I was absolutely shocked to receive such a curt response to that query saying we will be heading to court. I feel I am the only director working in the interest of the OMC.“In my own capacity as Director of the OMC I shall continue to act in the interests of all members of the OMC.”The owners’ management company has now requested that Sherborough Enterprises enter mediation in order to get a fair result."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3903671.1558726775!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord down with this particular sort of swing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMaria Bailey took a slide off a swing at the Dean Hotel  and ended up on a legal roundabout. Photograph:  Ellen Rose O’Riordan Down with this sort of swing!Full marks to the Indo’s Shane Phelan for his story about TD Maria Bailey and the night she took a slide off a swing and ended up on a legal roundabout causing politicians to trade see-saw remarks about whether or not she should have exercised her fundamental right to sue.We can show you photographs of the swings in question. Stout ropes at the side and thick short planks for seats.It must be pointed out that the full details of the alleged incident involving deputy Bailey and the swing upstairs in the Dean Hotel are not known and Opposition politicians who have been critical of her decision to file a personal injury claim have been very careful to point this out. We do not know the ins and outs of this swing saga.Well, we do, to a certain extent. The swing went in and it went out and it went in and it went out and it went . . . Oops-o-jaysus!We won’t know everything until the case is heard in court.Book fast, via the usual outlets, as soon as a date is confirmed. We were thinking of buying tickets for Nile Rogers in St Anne’s Park next weekend but we might hold off now.Swing Out SisterAs the swing story gathered pace, members of the Government from the Taoiseach down swung into action when asked to comment on Swing Out Sister – the Fine Gael remix.The Minister for Justice was asked by RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke for his response after the story was raised in the Seanad by Independent Senator Michael McDowell and later commented upon by Opposition leaders.Charlie Flanagan noted the various contributions.“What I want to say, however, is that I am sure what has been leaked to the media, what has been leaked to Senator McDowell, is not the full story here.”As swinging Maria’s night out grabbed the headlines in sparkling contrast to the usual diet of Brexit, broadband, housing and health, there were dark mutterings of “dirty tricks” from Government sources around Leinster House as they wondered how news of Bailey’s legal action just happened to slip out in time for the local and European elections.A letter to publicansAfter many hours of filibustering from the Rural Independents Group and a lengthy last stand on the final day by Micheal Healy-Rae, Shane Ross’s controversial drink-driving legislation was passed by the Dáil last July.The result was 75 votes in favour and eight votes against. There were no abstentions, although several TDs from Fianna Fáil went missing. The party, despite expressing reservations about the measures, supported the government. Transport spokesman Robert Troy was among those who voted for the legislation.On the day, he echoed the views of TDs who condemned the delaying tactics of Healy-Rae and his colleagues.“We had a difference of opinion on one element of this Bill. I put my case as to why I felt the Minister’s proposals were disproportionate, but we voted on it and moved on,” Troy told the Dáil, putting on the record that he did not condone the filibustering by the rural independents.He also criticised Ross for the delay in pushing through the Bill. Had he been “deadly serious about road safety, he would have prioritised this Bill over the Judicial Appointments Bill and we could have had it debated and enacted now”.This week, with crucial elections about to take place, Robert Troy revisited last year’s Road Traffic Bill with a letter to publicans around the country informing them Fianna Fáil did not support the legislation while failing to mention that they still voted for it.Lack of support“Dear Publican, You are well aware of the changes introduced through recent amendments to the Road Traffic Act, in particular the change for drivers recorded with a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 50-80mg,” he writes, outlining the revised sanctions for drivers which had “a huge impact on the business of many publicans, in particular across rural Ireland.”Troy tells them “We in Fianna Fáil hold the view that these changes were completely disproportionate to the offence.”Robert’s next line is written in bold and underlined. “My purpose in writing to you is to highlight the fact that Fianna Fáil did not support this change.”He explains the party tabled an amendment seeking to retain the penalty pointsfine sanction for the lower reading.The next sentence is also in bold type: “However this proposal was voted down in Dáil Éireann by a combination of Fine Gael, Sinn Féin, Labour and some Independents.”As opposed to the Road Traffic Bill, which was not voted down by Fianna Fáil.Still enjoying his cake and eating it, Troy concludes, “There has been much comment about these recent changes and some are of the view that all parties supported this proposal, which is not the case.”This is true. Eight rural TDs voted against it. Michael Healy-Rea, Danny Healy-Rae, Michael Collins, Mattie McGrath, Michael Fitzmaurice, Clare Daly, Michael Lowry and Mick Wallace.Not one of them from Fianna Fáil.Swings and roundaboutsJerry Buttimer, the leader of the Seanad, wisely decided not to address Senator McDowell’s amusing comments on “the issue of the swing” as the matter is before the courts.“It’s the swing vote issue I’m concerned about,” says McDowell, who is eyeing a Dáil return.“The swing vote didn’t benefit you on a couple of occasions. It did on others,” says Butsy.“Roll on Independents Day!” cries Gerard Craughwell on behalf of his Independent colleague as the Senators start throwing around quips about swings and roundabouts.Then the official Dáil record takes a decidedly odd turn.Kevin Humphreys: But he’s not stoned.Decriminalising cannabisButtimer: Many hope Senator McDowell’s prevarication ends soon. The Senator is swinging one way or the other, depending on who he meets. I really hope that he can.Craughwell: Down with that sort of thing now.”What on earth were they on about?In terms of swinging both ways, Jerry Buttimer was referring to Michael McDowell’s attempts to make up his mind on whether or not to run again for the Dáil. The comments about him being “stoned” stemmed from an earlier remark during an exchange about decriminalising cannabis.To end on a light note, I note that marriage equality between homosexual people and decriminalisation of cannabis both came in at the same time in Canada recently. One of the newspapers said that evangelists were completely shocked by this because they were worried about the phrase in the Bible that said “if a man shall lie with another man as if his wife, he shall be stoned”.Heart of stoneFormer Tory cabinet minister David Mellor resurfaced in the wake of Theresa May’s teary announcement with a refreshing hit of Oscar Wilde for the sad-eyed hypocrites lining up to laud her courage and dignity. Unlike the prime minister’s erstwhile detractors welling up for the cameras with showy compassion, he looked the gathering mawkishness firmly in the eye and sent it packing.“Well it was, David Mellor, quite an emotional speech, especially at the very end there,” said the man from the BBC. “Did you feel a measure of sympathy for her as she announced her timetable for resignation?”“No,” Mellor shot back. “Like someone once wrote about the death of Little Nell: ‘You’d need a heart of stone not to laugh’.”That’s the spirit.Charles and Camilla left Ireland with quite a haul of gifts after their visit this week. They will never want for embroidered baby blankets or handwoven throws again. Where some people might stash such lovely items in a bottom drawer, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall need an entire bottom floor for all the stuff that floods their way.Minister of State at the Office of Public Works Kevin Boxer Moran made sure to deliver his present in person to the prince as opposed to handing it to one of his many protocol people. Boxer waylaid Charles as he was on his way out of the marquee in the National Botanic Gardens and handed him a little blue attaché case containing a blue baby blanket for his latest grandson, Archie.The minister in charge of flood relief was never far from the prince’s side as he went for a ramble in the wildflower meadow and tootled around the trees.This was not what officials from Iveagh House on this side of the water, and Clarence House on the other, wanted. These visits are meticulously planned and a lot of advance planning and effort goes into framing the best photo opportunities and painting the visit in the most advantageous light for both sides.Not a bad idea as Brexit blunders on.But from the moment the royal guest arrived to the time he left, Boxer and his junior ministerial colleague, Andrew Doyle, were in every frame. (Or at least in most of them, except for when Charles asked them to stay out of a shot he wanted with just himself and the gardener, Séamus O’Brien.) The photographers were tearing their hair out.Afterwards, Boxer was unapologetic. He explained that the last time Prince Charles visited, he listened to what people from foreign affairs were telling him to do and stayed well back.But this didn’t please the OPW. His department wanted its own photographs to showcase the minister showing the Prince of Wales their achievements. “They ate the head off me,” he said. “I wasn’t going to make that mistake again.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3903350.1558711639!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what trends to look out for in the local elections","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar  after voting in Scoil Thomais in Castleknock, Dublin. His Fine Gael party is hoping to make gains in the local elections, although party figures do not expect it to overtake Fianna Fáil as the largest party in local government. Photograph: Aidan CrawleyWhile much of the attention of the past few weeks has centred on the outcome of the European elections, the local elections are regarded as a more accurate harbinger of what could happen in the next Dáil contest.Personalities dominate the drive for seats in the European parliament, while the campaigns to fill councils are impacted by more prosaic matters.The main parties will be watching a number of areas as votes are counted this weekend to discern patterns that could illuminate their strengths and weaknesses across the country.FINE GAELFine Gael is hoping to make gains, although party figures do not expect to overtake Fianna Fáil as the largest party in local government.Its poor showing in Cork in 2014 was an early indicator of the bad Munster performance that followed in the general election two years later.On Cork County Council, party sources say Fine Gael can increase its representation and fill between 16 and 21 of the 55 seats. Targets include getting two councillors elected in ClonakiltySkibbereen – where Fine Gael currently has no councillors – and it is also aiming for three seats in the BandonKinsale and Macroom wards.On Cork City Council, Fine Gael has one councillor north of the Lee and four south of it. It wants to increase that to three and five respectively.Away from Cork, it wants to copper-fasten its hold on the middle classes by getting two seats in the Clontarf ward of Dublin City Council with Naoise Ó Muirí and new candidate Jeff Johnston. It also wants three out of six seats in the Blackrock ward on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.Donegal is also slated for gains – from six seats to nine – by Fine Gael insiders.Two counties in particular – Sligo and Offaly – are being watched as potential windows into the mood of rural voters. The party only won three seats on each council in 2014, and improvement on both is seen as a must.FIANNA FÁILThe contest between Fine Gael TD Noel Rock and Fianna Fáil’s Paul McAuliffe in Dublin North West will be one of the key battles of the next general election. McAuliffe, a sitting Dublin city councillor, wants to bring in running mate Keith Connolly in the Ballymun-Finglas ward this weekend as he builds towards his Dáil challenge.The election of Michael Watters or Ammar Ali in the South West Inner City would be good news for Senator Catherine Ardagh, who is standing in the Dublin South Central Dáil constituency.Others running in the locals in Dublin before standing for the Dáil include Mary Fitzpatrick in the Cabra-Glasnevin ward of Dublin City Council and Olivia Buckley in the Dundrum ward of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.Fianna Fáil wants to increase its support in working class areas of Dublin such as Ringsend, and Elizabeth Watson’s vote in the southeast inner city will be an indication of success or failure in that endeavour. Winning two seats out of six in Clontarf -–with Cathal Haughey hoping to join Deirdre Heney on the city council – would provide a boost in a middle-class area.The party only won five out of 40 seats on South Dublin County Council in 2014, but it has since recruited two sitting councillors to its ranks. It will hope its seven outgoing councillors are joined by at least another three. There is said to be less scope for growth on Fingal County Council.SINN FÉINSinn Féin is hoping to maintain its existing base at local authority level. Other parties report that its electoral appeal is nowhere near its level of 2014, when the local elections took place at the height of controversy over water charges and austerity.“It’s a good day if you are holding your own and improving a wee bit,” said a party strategist, who added that gains could come in Cork city with Eolan Ryng and Mandy O’Leary, as well as in Dungarvan in Waterford with Conor McGuinness.Winning a seat on Longford County Council – the only county on the island were Sinn Féin has no elected representative – is seen as key. Sinn Féin’s most ambitious target is to take three out of six seats in the Tralee electoral area, but Mary Lou McDonald will be happy with consolidation across the country.McDonald’s leadership has not delivered the increase in popularity many in Sinn Féin hoped for, and the party will watch the share of first-preference votes as much as the number of councillors elected.LABOURThe local elections are a big test of Brendan Howlin’s efforts to revive the fortunes of the Labour Party. Its seven TDs and four Senators have been tasked with bringing it at least one extra councillor on their respective local authorities as they seek to strengthen the party’s position in constituencies where it has Oireachtas representation.Labour is targeting seats in four wards – the southeast inner city, Ballyfermot-Drimnagh, the north inner city and Donaghmede – of Dublin City Council where it currently has none.Additional seats on Westmeath County Council would also help the party retain its Dáil seat for Longford-Westmeath as party stalwart Willie Penrose retires at the next general election.The performance of Michelle Hall in the Drogheda Rural ward of Louth County Council will indicate if local senator Ged Nash’s efforts to return to the Dáil are on track.GREEN PARTYGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan wants to increase the number of Green councillors from 12 to at least 25. Success is likely in middle-class Dublin. For example, the Greens hope to return a councillor in each of the six Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council wards. The party currently has two councillors on the entire council.With talk of a Green surge, Ryan also wants to build the party nationally and not just in the urban centres of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.The election of candidates such as Róisín Garvey in the Ennistymon ward of Clare Pippa Hackett in Edenderry, Offaly Louise Heavin in Athlone, Westmeath Bláithín Gallagher in Manorhamilton, Leitrim and Marc Ó Cathasaigh in Tramore, Waterford, would show that a Green tide is not just an urban, middle-class fad.OTHERS:The Social Democrats, in its first local election campaign, hopes to add to the seven councillors it has recruited since it began in 2015. It is hopeful Anne Marie McNally will be elected in Lucan, along with Sharon Nolan in Galway city, Sarah Jane Hennelly in Limerick, and Sinead Halpin in Cork city. The party will need a successful outing to prove it has a viable future.Independent candidates aligned to TDs – such as Damien O’Farrell in Clontarf, Dublin, who works for Finian McGrath – will be watched to see if their performances hold any clues for the future prospect of Independents who entered Government.Figures in the main parties believe 2014 was the high water mark of the harder left parties, and the council results will indicate if they are correct.Full results and in depth analysis of the local elections"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3903651.1558726772!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"candidates jostle for position after may exit","story":"British prime minister Theresa May has announced that she will leave her office, three years after succeeding David Cameron.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish  prime minister Theresa May making a statement outside 10 Downing Street. She   has announced that she will resign on Friday, June 7th. Photograph: Leon NealGetty ImagesCandidates to succeed Theresa May as British prime minister were jostling for position last night after she announced her resignation in a tearful statement outside 10 Downing Street.Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would contest the Conservative leadership, joining his predecessor Boris Johnson and international trade secretary Rory Stewart.Other cabinet ministers are expected to follow in the coming days, including home secretary Sajid Javid, environment secretary Michael Gove, defence secretary Penny Mordaunt and health secretary Matt Hancock.Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is also expected to join the race, and former Commons leader Andrea Leadsom is considering a second leadership bid.Watched by her husband Philip and senior aides, Mrs May’s voice cracked as she almost broke down towards the end of her statement announcing that she would resign as Conservative leader on June 7th.\u0026nbspMajority\u0026nbspShe said she had done her best to win a parliamentary majority for the withdrawal agreement, and warned her successor that compromise was needed to agree any Brexit deal.“It will be for my successor to seek a way forward that honours the result of the referendum. To succeed, he or she will have to find consensus in parliament where I have not. Such a consensus can only be reached if those on all sides of the debate are willing to compromise.”Ms May’s resignation puts Brexit in a new phase that may be “very dangerous for Ireland”, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said. Mr Varadkar said her departure could lead to the election of a “Eurosceptic” prime minister.The Taoiseach said her successor may scrap the Brexit withdrawal agreement. “We may see the election of a Eurosceptic prime minister who wants to repudiate the withdrawal agreement and go for no-deal, or we may even see a new British government that wants a closer relationship with the EU and goes for a second referendum,” said Mr Varadkar. But the Taoiseach said that whatever happens, the Irish Government will “hold its nerve”.NominationsMrs May will stay on as prime minister until a new Conservative leader is elected. Nominations will close on June 10th, and MPs will then vote in successive rounds to choose two candidates to go before all members of the party, with a result expected in late July.The clear frontrunner is Mr Johnson, who told a conference in Switzerland on Friday that he would not seek a further article 50 extension beyond the end of October. “We will leave the EU on October 31st, deal or no deal.”He suggested that he would seek to negotiate changes to the Brexit deal, but would leave without an agreement if necessary.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Leon NealGetty ImagesBefore Theresa May walked up to the podium outside 10 Downing Street to announce her resignation, she had a meeting inside with 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady to agree terms. She agreed to resign as Conservative leader on June 7th, at the end of a week dominated by Donald Trump’s state visit and events to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day.She will stay on as prime minister while the Conservatives choose a successor but she took the opportunity of her statement on Friday to defend her record, particularly in pushing for a Brexit deal.“I have done everything I can to convince MPs to back that deal.\u0026nbspSadly, I have not been able to do so. I tried three times. I believe it was right to persevere, even when the odds against success seemed high. But it is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead that effort,” she said.With Boris Johnson, who left her cabinet in protest against the deal, the frontrunner to succeed her, Mrs May said the next prime minister would face the same challenge that she did.“It is, and will always remain, a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit. It will be for my successor to seek a way forward that honours the result of the referendum. To succeed, he or she will have to find consensus in parliament where I have not. Such a consensus can only be reached if those on all sides of the debate are willing to compromise,” she said.Finished in tearsMrs May defended her domestic policy record, pointing to increased funding for mental health and new measures to tackle domestic violence. But as she approached the end of her statement, Mrs May’s voice began to crack and she finished in tears.“I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honour of my life to hold – the second female prime minister but certainly not the last. I do so with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love,” she said.As tributes to the prime minister came in from her colleagues, including many who plotted her downfall, the Conservative Party chairman and senior officers in the 1922 Committee announced plans for the contest to succeed her. Nominations will close on June 10th and MPs will then vote in successive rounds to choose two candidates to go before all members of the party.The plan is to hold hustings around the country before the membership votes in a postal ballot, with a result expected by the start of the summer parliamentary recess in late July. In a surprise move, the party officers said that non-Conservatives could attend the hustings and ask questions of the candidates.‘Solemn responsibility’“We are deeply conscious that the Conservatives are not just selecting the person best placed to become the new leader of our party, but also the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. That is a solemn responsibility, particularly at such an important time for our nation. We will therefore propose that the leadership election and hustings involve opportunities for non-members and people who may not yet vote Conservative to meet the candidates and put their questions to them too,” they said.Within hours of Mrs May’s statement, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said that he would be a candidate to succeed her. Mr Johnson, who said earlier this month that he would be a candidate, told a conference in Switzerland on Friday that he would not seek a further article 50 extension.“We will leave the EU on October 31st, deal or no deal,” he said.He suggested that he would seek to negotiate changes to the Brexit deal but would leave without an agreement if necessary.“A new leader will have the opportunity to do things differently and have the momentum of a new administration,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Simon DawsonTheresa May will resign the leadership of Britain’s Conservative Party on Friday, June 7th, and will remain prime minister until her successor is chosen, she announced on Friday morning. Mrs May’s voice broke as she said it had been the “honour of my life” to “serve the country I love”.Speaking outside 10 Downing Street in London, she said she had been Britain’s second woman prime minister, “but certainly not the last”, and she bore no ill-will to her political opponents. She said she believed she had been right to persevere in her efforts to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. However, it was now clear to her that it was in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to take charge, she said. “I will resign as leader on Friday, 7th June, so a successor can be chosen.”Mrs May will therefore still be prime minister when US president Donald Trump makes his state visit to the UK at the start of June.Mrs May’s government postponed Friday’s planned publication of the Bill after ministers told her they could not support it.Reacting to Mrs May’s announcement, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Mrs May had striven to chart a new future for Britain and he looked forward to working with her successor.“I got to know Theresa May very well over the last two years. She is principled, honourable and deeply passionate about doing her best for her country, and her party,” Mr Varadkar said.“Politicians throughout the EU have admired her tenacity, her courage and her determination during what has been a difficult and challenging time.“Theresa May strove to chart a new future for the United Kingdom. I want to wish her the very best for the future. And I look forward to working closely with her successor.”Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Mrs May understood Ireland’s “vulnerabilities” and the UK’s “responsibilities” . He said that was why she signed off on the Withdrawal Agreement, which he believed was a sensible compromise for everybody. “And it’s why she was a strong defender of the need for the backstop as an insurance mechanism, as a fallback position, as a temporary arrangement while permanent arrangements can be discussed and agreed, should the backstop ever be needed,” Mr Coveney said.“And that logic and those issues aren’t going to go away just because you have a new British prime minister who may have said things that counter or undermine Theresa May’s position in the past.”Northern IrelandMeanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose party has been propping up the Conservative Party in Westminster, also paid tribute.“After the general election in June 2017, we worked with the prime minister and her team through the confidence and supply agreement. Whilst at times there were differences in our approach, particularly on Brexit, we enjoyed a respectful and courteous relationship,” Ms Foster said.“In particular, I commend and thank the prime minister for her dutiful approach on national issues and her willingness to recognise Northern Ireland’s need for additional resources through confidence and supply arrangements. “I pay tribute to her selfless service in the interests of the United Kingdom and wish her well for the future.”After a premiership of almost three years, Mrs May met Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful Conservative 1922 Committee, on Friday morning to set out a timetable for her departure.The committee’s executive held a secret ballot this week on changing party rules to allow an immediate confidence vote in the prime minister if she refuses to leave, but Sir Graham was keeping the ballots sealed until Friday’s meeting.Mrs May, once a reluctant supporter of EU membership, won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, and is to step down with her central pledges – to lead the United Kingdom out of the European Union and heal its isions – unfulfilled.She endured repeated crises and humiliation in her effort to find a compromise Brexit deal that parliament could ratify. British politics remains deadlocked over how, when or whether to leave the EU.The treasurer of the 1922 Committee, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, previously said he expected Mrs May would stay on as a caretaker prime minister while a successor was chosen.“It would be much tidier if she stays on as caretaker while we go through our processes of electing a leader of the Conservative Party who will then eventually take over as prime minister,” Sir Geoffrey told the BBC before Mrs May’s announcement.A leadership election is thought likely to last about six weeks, starting on June 10th, after Mr Trump’s state visit to Britain.Mrs May’s departure will deepen the Brexit crisis as a new leader is likely to want a more decisive split, raising the chances of a confrontation with the EU and a snap parliamentary election.Mr Juncker “liked her and appreciated working with her” and “very much respected” Mrs May, who he was reported as saying was “a very courageous woman”. He would continue to remain in touch and was ready to talk to whoever succeeds her as prime minister.The spokeswoman said the EU’s position on the non-negotiability of the Withdrawal Agreement remained, and the working assumption of the union remains that the UK will depart before October 31st. The commission, she said, has completed extensive “preparedness” planning – for a no-deal departure – and she refused to be drawn on a suggestion that the UK might now need to ask for another extension.Speaking in Brussels, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said: “I just want to express my full respect for Theresa May and for her determination in working towards an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom. And on our side we would work exactly in that direction in the next few weeks and months.” When asked if a new prime minister could change things, he said: “What could happen now, let me just clearly say here in Brussels that it is for the UK to decide. Nobody else.”Manfred Weber, an ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel and the centre-right’s lead candidate to replace Mr Juncker after the European elections, said Brexit was a “total disaster” but Mrs May “fought for a stable solution and a viable deal”.Brexit-related developments will now form part of the leaders’ dinner discussion scheduled for Tuesday, which Mrs May is expected to attend. The meeting had been planned to discuss the outcome of the European Parliament elections and specifically how to deal with the appointment of Mr Juncker’s successor as head of the Commission.French president Emmanuel Macron praised Mrs May’s “courageous work”, and US president Donald Trump said he felt bad for her. “I like her very much, she is a good woman, she worked very hard,” Mr Trump said.Next prime ministerThe leading contenders to succeed Mrs May all want a tougher orce deal, although the EU has said it will not renegotiate the Withdrawal Treaty it sealed in November.Boris Johnson, the face of the official Brexit campaign in 2016, is the favourite to succeed May. Betting markets put a 40 per cent chance of Mr Johnson winning the top job in the event that a contest takes place.Others tipped by betting markets are Dominic Raab, a Brexit supporter and former Brexit secretary. Betting markets put him on a 14 per cent chance.Environment secretary Michael Gove, former House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt each have a 7 per cent chance, according to betting markets.Betting markets give defence secretary Penny Mordaunt and international development secretary Rory Stewart each a 4 per cent chance of the top job, while home secretary Sajid Javid has a 3 per cent chance.Britain’s new prime minister must move quickly to “properly” leave the EU, Mr Johnson said on Friday at a conference in Switzerland.Mr Johnson said Mrs May had been “patient and stoical” in facing all the difficulties surrounding the country’s departure from the bloc.

By 2000 this figure dropped to almost 28,000.The country has now seen no new infections since 2013 and is the first nation in WHO Africa region to be declared malaria-free in more than 40 years – only  Mauritius, which achieved the goal in 1973, has also eliminated the disease in the region. “Algeria is where the malaria parasite was first discovered in humans almost a century and a half ago, and that was a significant milestone in responding to the disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti WHO regional director for Africa.“Now Algeria has shown the rest of Africa that malaria can be beaten through country leadership, bold action, sound investment and science. The rest of the continent can learn from this experience,” she said. War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Algeria\u0027s success has been due to a combination of free malaria diagnosis and treatment and a well-trained health workforce. Similar factors have helped Argentina eradicate the parasitic disease – the second country in South America to do so following Paraguay last year. “Argentina reported the last indigenous case in 2010 and has demonstrated the commitment, the capacity within its health, laboratory and surveillance systems, and the necessary financing to prevent the re-establishment of malaria within the country”, said Dr Carissa F. Etienne, director of the WHO Pan American Health Organization.“I am sure that Argentina will serve as an inspiration and as an example for other countries of the Americas to achieve the elimination of malaria in the coming years,” she added. India and Rwanda have made huge progress in tackling malariaAccording to the 2018 World Malaria Report, China is also close to eradicating the disease and Rwanda, Ethiopia and Pakistan have reduced infection levels. The countries are a highlights in an otherwise gloomy global picture. The countries with the highest disease burden are all moving backwards, including Nigeria, DRC, Mozambique and Uganda.“The news that Algeria and Argentina have been declared malaria free is a remarkable achievement for both countries,” said Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, CEO of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria.“As well as saving precious lives and strengthening health systems, malaria-free status provides external economic benefits for these countries enabling them to free up resources to address other health and development priorities and improve worker productivity and school attendance.“Other countries now have two more nations that serve as examples of how elimination can be achieved,” Dr Diallo added.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Trump 2020: an exclusive first look inside The President\u0026#39s re-election war roomComment: Bless these Tory leadership contenders.

Her grandparents and great grandparents worked there and her cousin is now doing a British Steel apprenticeship.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmers“My story is not unique,” she says. “Steel has been central to the area for 150 years it’s steeped in history. Scunthorpe was built around steel, not the other way round.”Closing the steelworks would take out a huge amount of wages from the economy. The average steel worker makes £36,000, well above average for the region and the UK as a whole. It would double the local unemployment rate in the region, even before any jobs are inevitably lost in the supply chain.But the impact goes beyond that.\u0026nbspHundreds of local businesses rely on steel indirectly.“My brother has a car garage across the road from the steelworks,” says Ms Childs, who is now a representative for the GMB union.“Most of his customers\u0026nbspwork for British Steel or its contractors. Where is his income going to come from?“There are loads of businesses that are there purposely because of British Steel, like the cafe where the workers can go for a cheeky butty on their break.”Scunthorpe MP Nic Dakin is determined to find a resolution that allows workers to keep their jobs. Closure would cause strategic damage to the UK, he said.“This is not just about the core of 4,500 workers that would lose their jobs and not just about those in and around Scunthorpe.“In the blast furnaces at Scunthorpe we are talking about a national strategic asset. To lose that would damage the supply of steel to key industries like defence.“The steel industry is the foundation of manufacturing in this country and vitally important for our economy.”After the UK’s last steelworks closure at\u0026nbspRedcar in 2015, the UK now has just two active blast furnaces – Scunthorpe and Port Talbot in South Wales. They provide some of the highest quality steel in the world.“Once you lose that capability you can’t make your own steel. Are we serious about being a modern, independent nation?” asks Dakin.Such concerns are particularly pertinent at a time of growing nationalism in trade policy with Donald Trump pushing up US tariff barriers and China responding in kind.\u0026nbsp“We would have to import from overseas, where production might be less carbon friendly, the impact on the environment and air quality is higher“You can be held to ransom if you need to import to build important national assets: your railways, ships, planes and whatever else.Ms Childs agrees that the UK will be left in a vulnerable position. “If the Tories abandon manufacturing in the UK, as they seem to be doing, China will one day finish flooding the market with cheap steel and realise that there’s no competition left.”Another thing that\u0026nbspirks is that despite pledges to support steel as part of its industrial strategy, the government undermined it in one important way.When EU steel tariffs were proposed after China began dumping steel onto markets, pushing down prices,\u0026nbspBritain led efforts not to introduce tariffs that would have protected British steel.“It’s fine for the government to talk about an industrial strategy, but what does that actually mean?”Anna Soubry came to visit when steel was facing its last crisis in 2015.“I couldn’t tell you one tangible thing that they did after that.”While many people might want to blame Brexit for the closure, the government must look at its own record, says Ms Childs.“Once the Brexit shambles is over there will still be the same problems and issues that were there before.”British businesses pay twice as much for energy as their French counterparts while business rates are five to 10\u0026nbsptimes as high as on the continent.The experience of Redcar, points to what could befall Scunthorpe if the British Steel plant were allowed to close. Average weekly wages have gone from being some of the highest in the region to amongst the lowest since the steelworks shut.“Redcar knows only too well the cost of a closed steelworks and the impact it has on families, on communities, and on the local economy,” says MP Anna Turley.“Former steelworkers still contact my office needing support.”\u0026nbspBritish Steel’s Scunthorpe site – which is as big as a town in itself – also poses big, and expensive, problems for the environment.Steelworks can leave behind a toxic legacy which presents dangers to the public. Following a plant closure in Corby, Northamptonshire, 19 children were born with deformed feet and hands after their mothers inhaled toxic particles while pregnant during the Eighties\u0026nbspand Nineties.In Redcar, many more millions need to be spent to make the site safe and ready to become productive again.“It’s costing millions every month, and has been for three and a half years, just to keep the site safe,” says Anna Turley.\u0026nbsp“That is before any real clean up work has begun.“The cost of closure is astronomical, especially in comparison to much smaller sums needed to protect the assets, keep them running, and give the business and workforce a future.”The cost of environmental clean-up in Scunthorpe would be “at least” in the hundreds of millions of pounds and would take years, says local MP Nic Dakin – a huge bill that would be footed by taxpayers.“While its operating and it’s safe it’s all an asset but once it stops operating there are some dangerous things there,” he says.Some critics have said that market forces must be allowed to run their course and that the industry is in terminal decline -\u0026nbsp186,000 were employed in UK steel in 1981 compared to just 32,000 last year. Yorkshire and the Humber has already been the worst hit region with 40,000 jobs gone.But there this simplistic story of decline is misleading. Despite little support from the government, the average steel worker has become roughly five times more productive than they were in 1970 a significantly bigger improvement than in the economy as a whole.Given the UK’s current dire level of productivity growth, jettisoning some of the country’s most skilled workers would raise some serious questions.Now that the company has gone into liquidation there are three main options: find a buyer, nationalise or close it down.\u0026nbspThe public broadly supports nationalisation, with 48 per cent of people believing British Steel should be taken back into public ownership compared to just 18 per cent thinking the opposite, according to a new YouGov poll.It reveals that, even among Tory voters, 41 per cent think British Steel should be nationalised compared to 30 per cent who don’t.Nationalisation is the last thing that would have helped British SteelThis leaves a tricky decision for business secretary Greg Clark. Nationalisation of key assets such as the energy and rail networks has been a high-profile element of Labour’s policy platform -\u0026nbsp and one that some Tories have ridiculed.\u0026nbspTo take the British Steel into public ownership could easily be seen as a capitulation or at least an admission that Labour has a point. But to do otherwise could appear heartless. It would also be criticised as\u0026nbspa failure of the government’s industrial strategy, part of which was supposed to be a sector deal to support the steel industry.Clark has said that there are interested private-sector parties but Ms Childs is wary that an “unscrupulous” owner may enter the fray.“We don’t want a buyer that wants to take certain bits of the steel works and discard the rest or charge extortionate rates of interest.\u0026nbsp“We want someone who will take the whole thing and make steel in Scunthorpe for the foreseeable future.”“One thing is for sure” she says. “Through the financial crisis, the 2015 steel crisis and this current crisis, the men and women that work at that plant have always turned up, worked hard and delivered the best steel they can.\u0026nbsp“They will never stop doing that. Unless the gates close for good.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Dean Turner, UK economist as UBS Wealth Management, forecast that the pound could crash to as low as 1.15 against the dollar and close to parity against the euro in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He warned investors not to be complacent about the prospect.“Despite mounting public impatience over the process, many top officials and lawmakers remain fearful of the economic damage from a no-deal exit,” said Mr Turner.“Lingering uncertainty would likely cause firms to delay investment, and keep sterling under downward pressure.”“A UK decision to remain an EU member would likely cause a swift rebound in sterling, which we believe is undervalued relative to its purchasing power parity level of around USD 1.58.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was a strong stance against the unregulated, so-called wild-west world of cryptocurrency, and some feared it was an attempt to silence the nascent space. But secretly, the social network was actually planning its own version of the virtual currency.Less than a year after the ban was\u0026nbsplifted, details about what this cryptocurrency might look like have emerged. GlobalCoin, as it is reportedly called, may be about to upend the entire payments industry.The social network, which is used by more than two\u0026nbspbillion people around the world, has sought advice from the Bank of England and US Treasury about how the virtual currency could integrate with existing payment systems.Created with Sketch.Facebook birthday: 15 defining moments for the social network Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called \u0027TheFacebook\u0027 from his dorm.

This new small team is exploring different applications.How would GlobalCoin work?It is understood that the value of GlobalCoin will be pegged to a handful of established currencies, like the US dollar and euro, in order to avoid the price volatility issues that continue to plague bitcoin.It remains unclear whether Facebook\u0027s cryptocurrency will be decentralised like bitcoin. Industry experts have questioned whether the social network would launch a digital currency that was out of its control, despite advocates considering decentralisation a key tenet\u0026nbspof cryptocurrency.Bitcoin now accepted at Starbucks and dozens of other shopsMark Zuckerberg doesn\u0027t have an idea how to implement it where Facebook doesn\u0027t own it, Phil Chen, who masterminded the HTC Exodus blockchain smartphone, said in March.Cryptocurrencies are open, decentralised, censorship resistant and borderless – this is completely antithetical to the current business model of big technology companies, whose walled gardens mean they essentially own their customers.Facebook is also currently planning a merger of its other social media platforms, which include Instagram and WhatsApp, meaning GlobalCoin could be transferred between\u0026nbspa variety of apps. Both the merger and the cryptocurrency launch are expected to take place at some point in 2020.Rival messaging apps are also working on their own cryptocurrencies, with Telegram expected to launch its so-called GRAM cryptocurrency later this year.Competing with ChinaOne explanation to why Facebook feels the need to have its own currency lies in a country where Facebook and its various apps aren\u0027t even allowed: China.In order to compete on a global scale with the social networks and messaging apps spreading out of China, its own form of currency could give Facebook the upper hand.Corporate lawyer and fintech expert\u0026nbspTim Bird, who has worked closely with Facebook in the past, said he believed\u0026nbspGlobalCoin\u0026nbspwould give Facebook a new hold over advertising revenues thanks to the massive amounts of data it could generate.Ever since I spent a day working in Facebook HQ in Menlo Park, California, three years ago, it has been evident that they feel the need to challenge China, Bird told\u0026nbspThe Independent.To do this, Facebook needs a currency or payment platform of its own.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However,\u0026nbspcannibalism remains a central fascination for the author. As\u0026nbspMM Owen declares,\u0026nbspthe universe is forever dining on itself, but figures such as\u0026nbspClarice Starling and Cari Mora want to interrupt the mealClick to followThe IndependentA ghost at the cannibal feast: Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in 1991’s ‘The Silence of the Lambs’, which won five OscarsIn his “perfectly natural history” of cannibalism, the zoologist Bill Schutt takes until page one to reference Hannibal Lecter eating a census-taker’s liver with some fava beans and a big Amarone. Lecter might be literature’s most famous serial killer he is without doubt its most famous cannibal. Lecter’s creator, Thomas Harris, recently published Cari Mora – his first novel in 13 years, and his first in 44 years not to feature the character made famous by an unblinking, enunciating Anthony Hopkins. And yet: despite Lecter’s absence in Cari Mora, the cannibalism persists. We meet Mr\u0026nbspImran, “a large, impassive man with a cauliflower ear”. A character recalls that Imran is “a biter”, and “could not always help it”. At the end of the chapter, sat in his car, Imran eats a human kidney, raw.Lecter is absent, and yet here he lingers, a ghost at the cannibal feast. Why? Why can’t Harris help but include a glimpse of this dark appetite? Because at the core of Harris’s hugely popular horror fiction has always been a vision of the cosmos as fundamentally self-devouring. As Schutt outlines, cannibalism occurs across “the entire animal kingdom”.It is common among\u0026nbspinvertebrates, fish, and reptiles, and it is observable in many mammals, including our closest cousins, chimpanzees. Such cannibalism generally occurs for reasons “that make perfect sense from an evolutionary standpoint: reducing competition, as a component of sexual behaviour, or an aspect of parental care.” (On parental care: if you want nightmares, go and google how the mother black lace-weaver spider feeds her young.)In the figure of Lecter, though, Harris elevated cannibalism into a sort of commentary, or performance, that reflects the real nature of reality. It is the essence of violence, but it is also simply predation in all its forms, including the sexual. Lecter embodied this greedy spirit, and Harris can’t shake his famous\u0026nbspvillain in Cari Mora, his shadow is everywhere. Lecter’s devouring of Clarice Starling’s spirit at the end of Hannibal is even given a rerun, suggesting that perhaps Harris regretted this final, polarising act of character consumption.Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) comes face to face with ‘a godless epicureanism’ (Rex)Cari Mora, Harris’s new novel, has two plots. Firstly, there is a battle between two criminal outfits to recover $25m worth of gold. This gold is locked inside a booby-trapped safe buried beneath an opulent waterfront mansion in Miami’s Biscayne Bay. Secondly, there is a far more familiar Harris motif: violent psychopath pursues attractive young woman. The leader of one of the gold-hunting gangs, Hans-Peter Schneider, has a day job that involves kidnapping such women, mutilating them, and selling them to a super-wealthy Mauritanian man with depraved sexual tastes. The Colombian-born Cari Mora, a former child soldier conscripted into Farc at the age of 11, is caretaker at the Escobar house. Hans-Peter’s pursuit of her runs until the novel’s penultimate page.These two dramas – the race to acquire Escobar’s gold, and Hans-Peter’s violent designs on Cari – don’t entirely hang together. Though Cari Mora is composed in Harris’s usual style – precise and wintry, occasionally oracular – most of the major players in the gold-digging story are too thinly drawn to ever become truly interesting, and a couple of backstories with the seeds of subplots wither away. Where the two stories connect, though, is in linking and mirroring different sorts of biological appetite.There is no mercy we make mercy, manufacture it in the parts that have overgrown our basic reptile brain. There is no murder. We make murder, and it matters only to usIn 2005, the journal Gothic Studies declared that “Thomas Harris is to contemporary Gothic fiction what Bram Stoker was to Gothic fiction in the 19th century.” They certainly resemble in each other in one way: both of their famous characters are men who like to dine on human flesh, and whose act of dining symbolises far more than satiating caloric need. Taken as a whole, Cari Mora reiterates Harris’s master metaphor: an unending, cosmic cannibalism.Everything Harris has ever written is filled with the goings-on of other species. Often, these goings-on are predatory, studded with insights into how a given creature does violence. (In Hannibal, we learn that “tusked pigs instinctively disembowel when fighting the upright species, men and bears.”) Throughout Cari Mora, animals are a constant. Barely a page goes by without a frog peeping, a bird whistling, a manatee surfacing, a firefly winking, a stingray flapping. Above all, Cari Mora is filled with birds: “ibisses, egrets, pelicans, ospreys, herons”. And as in the rest of Harris’s novels, the narrative is studded with glimpses of predation. Fish swallow insects ants are drawn to the protein of dried blood. We see pelicans “heading for a fish drive,” “crows mobbing a hawk,” two cormorants stalking some mullet.At one point, a character in Cari Mora stands at the seawall of the Escobar house and watches a school of crevalle jacks chase some mullet until there are “pieces of fish flying in the air”. “Like us,” he thinks “Kill and gobble like us.” Later, at an assisted-living facility, a “preacher of advanced age” holds a Bible and reads to his congregation from the Book of Ecclesiastes: “... men might see that they themselves are beasts ... For that which befalleth the sons of man befalleth beasts as the one dieth, so dieth the other yes, they have alone breath all are of the dust and all turn to dust again.” The preacher’s congregation are gathered in the garden, and the faithful are comprised of one elderly human, “four dogs, a cat, a small goat, a free parrot and several chickens”. Harris occasionally peels back his thematic curtain a little too much, and these two moments, taken together, are a good example. Cari Mora says it very clearly: humans are animals. Creatures like all the rest. And as the novel never lets us forget, what creatures do above all else is kill and gobble. This demolishing of human exceptionalism, reminder of the brute biosphere, recalls the end of Red Dragon, when Will Graham\u0026nbsprecalls a visit he took to Shiloh, Western Tennessee – site of a bloody 1862 American Civil War battle. Graham muses that Shiloh reflects “the indifference of nature ... there is no mercy we make mercy, manufacture it in the parts that have overgrown our basic reptile brain. There is no murder. We make murder, and it matters only to us.”Mictlantecuhtli and ritualistic cannibalism in prehiic Mesoamerica in the ‘Codex Magliabechiano’The American author Thomas Ligotti has argued that all modern horror writing – from Ann Radcliffe through Edgar Allan Poe through HP\u0026nbspLovecraft – is inspired by a biologically derived pessimism. Call it the disillusionment of Darwin. Effective horror is always, in Ligotti’s view, motivated by the capacity “not only to place humanity outside the centre of the Creation but also to survey the universe itself as centreless and our species as only a smudge of organic materials at the mercy of forces that know us not”. Ligotti’s thesis is absolutely true of Harris. (“We are elaborations of carbon,” Lecter tells Clarice, in a letter.) Continuing the framing of all of the Hannibal novels, in Cari Mora, we observe evolution’s ravenous menagerie, and a perpetual, ambient feeding frenzy. Like any creature, humans are essentially consumable, and thus potential prey. In Hannibal, Mason Verger wants to kill Lecter by feeding him to wild pigs, and is killed when a sister stuffs a moray eel down his throat. In Cari Mora, saltwater crocodiles dine on men, and more than one corpse is gnawed by crabs. In a flashback of Cari stumbling upon a corpse in the Colombian jungle, we see “buzzards flapping away, heavy from their meal”. The murderous Hans-Peter recalls revisiting a woman he dumped in the bush and finding her “warmed wonderfully – warmed warmer than life by the larval mounds.”William Blake, that great chronicler of innocence, is a constant touchpoint with Harris. It is innocence, and its cousin, frailty, that is always under threat, and always protected by his heroesSuch cross-species feasting functions as a sort of metaphorical ontology. If there is no bright line between species, then everything is cannibalism, and nothing is cannibalism. Meanwhile, the meal is never-ending. This has always been the ouroboros at the heart of Harris’s gothic horror: reality’s true condition is simply matter, devouring itself. All of it driven by the pure force of the senses and what they crave. That there is a dark sort of elegance to this is partly what made Lecter unique the original genius of him wasn’t that he was amoral, but that he replaced morality with aesthetics, with pleasure – and that it charmed. Hannibal was an unreal representation of his type in Hunting Humans, the serial murder expert Elliott Leyton writes that real serial killers are “usually without intellectual or physical attainments” “they are often uneducated and virtually illiterate” “their tastes are anything but elegant” “in sum, they are dull, unimaginative, socially defective, vengeful, self-absorbed and self-pitying human beings”. Lecter is the perfect inverse of all this. But it works, because fiction’s entire function is to tell the truth even as it lies. What Lecter represents is not real psychological profile but a worldview that is at once cruel and rather pretty. Lecter embodies a godless epicureanism, the elevation of the Goldberg Variations above human life. This is, in truth, the natural end of aesthetics. “Taste and smell are housed in parts of the mind that precede pity,” he explains to Clarice Starling, while sipping lillet with a slice of orange.In Red Dragon, the protagonist mentions what is today semi-common knowledge but what was then a fresh insight from FBI psychological profiling: “sadism to animals as a child” is a common precursor to violent psychopathy. By contrast – and in opposition to the cosmic cascade of imploding appetites that power his fictional universe – the virtuous characters in Harris’s fiction always care about animals. The standout example is Clarice Starling and her lambs. Starling’s drive to rescue murder victims is presented as a sort of existential quest, a need to insert at least brief spells of silence into her memory of lambs screaming on their way to the slaughter. William Blake, that great chronicler of innocence, is a constant touchpoint with Harris. It is innocence, and its cousin, frailty, that is always under threat, and always protected by his heroes. In Hannibal, Barney, another of Harris’s good guys, protects a wounded pigeon. In Cari Mora, Cari works part-time at the Pelican Harbour Seabird Station helping rehabilitate birds nursing injuries that will kill them in the wild. At one point, in an echo of Starling with her little lamb, Cari jumps off a boat and wades into some mangroves to rescue an osprey tangled in some fishing wire.13th century Hereford Mappa Mundi (ullstein bild via Getty)A pitiless cosmos, devouring itself a will to protect the weak, the about-to-be-devoured, whatever species they belong to. This old dualism of Harris’s – psychopathic killer and determined FBI agent order and chaos – provides the core tension in Cari Mora. It drives the encounter between Hans-Peter and Cari, which is not only the most memorable thing in the book, but clearly the section in which Harris was most interested. (The gold-digging plot wraps up rather abruptly, and the last three chapters focus entirely on Hans-Peter hunting Cari.) While Cari struggles to repair the wings of hurt birds, Hans-Peter dreams of reducing her to “a stump with a single branchy limb” “with which to provide pleasure to her masters”. She is blind compassion he is fastidious sadism.When they aren’t eating, the thing animals are most interested in is mating. And in the Harris cosmos – which is almost entirely absent of men and women having normal, healthy, edifying sex – erotic craving is another part of the feeding, just hunger felt in a different set of organs. At its most benign, this is an ambient, helpless lust that leaves people (mainly men) bitter and envious. At its worst, it is Harris’s serial killers, who feed their debased erotic fantasies with the flesh of women. An eroticised predation is present again in Cari Mora, with Hans-Peter’s pursuit of Cari. (The condition of men not raping women, meanwhile, is labelled “civilisation.”) It seems bold of Harris to have conjured another violent-psychopath-pursues attractive-young-woman setup. It is inevitable that this one will be compared to his famous original, the Lecter-Starling (or Hopkins-Foster) saga. The safer thing, surely, would have been to find a different sort of horror plot. What is he doing here? Why revisit this setup?This is a sort of manic, infantile madness one could never imagine with Lecter, who is so preternaturally composed that his pulse rate doesn’t rise when he’s biting a nurse’s tongue offA clue, I posit, lies in Cari Mora’s blurb: “Monsters lurk in the crevices between male desire and female survival. No other writer in the last century has conjured those monsters with more terrifying brilliance than Thomas Harris.” Sidestepping the bold central claim (in the whole last century?), what is left unsaid here is that the last time we saw Harris’s monsters in the open, many of his dedicated readers were profoundly let down. In 1999’s Hannibal, the culmination of the Lecter-Starling saga on the page, the tale ended with what John Lanchester described as the novel’s “moral algebra” being “spectacularly abandoned”. In short, Lecter’s worldview finally swallows Starling whole. She, tireless pursuer of murderers, fierce moralist, abandons it all. The pair move to Buenos Aires and become lovers. Some (including Stephen King) rather enjoyed the lurid leap of this, the devastating melodrama of Lecter’s icy allure finally triumphing and sucking a protector of lambs into the amoral void. But many loathed it not just for its sheer oddness – at one point, Starling actually breastfeeds Lecter – but for the deeper sense that it was a betrayal of Starling’s character. Jodie Foster felt so strongly about this that she didn’t reprise her role as Starling for the movie adaptation.Could this have been on Harris’s mind here, when he was writing Cari Mora? There is a moment in The Silence of the Lambs where Miggs – Lecter’s cell neighbour at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane – flicks semen into Starling’s face. Lecter finds this “unspeakably ugly” that night, he kills Miggs by talking him into swallowing his tongue. Early in Cari Mora, meanwhile, Hans-Peter makes a plan to creep up on Cari while she is asleep and masturbate over her cheek, “little facial, what the hell?” Even if the similarity of these sexual transgression is pure coincidence, it highlights neatly the key difference between Lecter and Hans-Peter. Unlike the vast majority of real-life male serial killers, Lecter himself is no misogynist. Not one of his murder victims are female. He is, in fact, something of a gentleman. Without his strange chivalry, he and Starling’s infernal romance could never have come to fruition.Hans-Peter, meanwhile, is a dedicated misogynist of the most depraved sort. And his misogyny is but one aspect of a variety of ways in which he has none of Lecter’s demonic charisma. Constantly composing German ditties in his head, Hans-Peter is absurd, comic, perversely childish. He is devoid of Lecter’s scholarly refinement, never pausing to offer a bit of chilling, arresting atheism. Hans-Peter is also properly unhinged\u0026nbsp – to a degree that doesn’t always quite work, the novel’s voice becoming brittle and forced in portraying it. At one point we see Hans-Peter sat on the floor of his shower, blowing an Aztec death whistle until he collapses shortly afterwards, he pours a whole carton of milk over his head. This is a sort of manic, infantile madness one could never imagine with Lecter, who is so preternaturally composed that his pulse rate doesn’t rise when he’s biting a nurse’s tongue off.Hans-Peter is, in short, utterly without charm. Throughout the novel, Cari is never anything other than repulsed by him. Many readers saw Starling’s capitulation at the end of Hannibal as not only silly, but a sort of feminine defeat. There is no such defeat in Cari Mora. Hans-Peter and Cari do not move to Buenos Aires and go to the opera and live sexually ever after. Some of the basics of the scenario feel like a rehash of Starling’s arc. Like Starling, Cari is an orphan, with the psychic scars to show for it. (Her family was massacred by paramilitaries in her second year as a soldier, and “when she heard she could not speak aloud for two weeks”). Starling had her screaming lambs Cari Mora is haunted by the memory of seeing two lovestruck 13-year-olds executed in the Colombian jungle. But unlike Starling, this damage does not leave her vulnerable to the dark persuasions of a serial murderer. Cari is stoic, preternaturally unflustered by horror. The novel is named for her, not her murderous pursuer – a privilege never bestowed on Starling. The pursuer is almost laughably unworthy of her actual affection. “Bound wrists appeared a lot in Cari’s dreams,” we read but when her wrists are actually bound in real life, she ingeniously escapes them. And when Cari is asked whether she wants “a guy,” her response, given a melody, could be a Beyoncé lyric: “I want to own the front door. Then maybe I invite somebody in it.”It’s tempting to say that this is Harris for the #MeToo era, but every one of his novels has featured what is commonly termed a strong female protagonist. This was chiefly what the end of Hannibal betrayed, for many. Cari is what is commonly termed badass, but so was Starling. The difference is that here, with a plot that mirrors many of the rudiments of his most famous one, Harris plays out a very different final act. Lust’s hungry gaze, and the rage that attends the rejected male, was always present in the Hannibal novels. Throughout, Starling is relentlessly ogled, and her career at the FBI is ultimately ruined by a man who never forgave her for spurning his advances, and loathed “the picky, petty homemaking skills of a woman” that made her such a brilliant agent. Cari is ogled too, but at the end of the novel named after her, she very clearly refuses to acquiesce to the manipulation of a violent male. Unlike the Hannibal novels, we see no final, masculine triumph of the sort of blind force that Simone Weil read into the Iliad.Lecter in the TV series ‘Hannibal’ (Rex)It is impossible not to ask: is this depiction of Hans-Peter and Cari, with its obvious echoes of Lecter and Starling, Harris reacting against the critiques of where he ended the latter arc in Hannibal? Is it an admission of narrative regret, even an attempt to partially repair that damage? Ridley Scott’s adaptation of Hannibal removed that sexually-ever-after ending, because Scott found it preposterous. Harris was apparently not only unoffended by this, but so convinced by Scott’s scepticism that he helped the screenwriter, Steve Zaillian, write the movie’s new ending. Did Harris have his doubts even then, less than two years after the book went to print? Is this why Hannibal Rising was so heartlessly dashed off? This is all scepticism, not least because Harris hasn’t given an interview in decades. But the uncharitable reading here would be that what Harris really wanted to do with Cari Mora was offer a coda or alternate ending to the Lecter-Starling arc – and he had to find a rather ordinary thriller plot in which to embed it.The animal care of Harris’s novels is a charity of this kind. A sort of defiant, doomed, selfless stand against the animal kingdom’s mindless gobbling“A thousand birds murmuring and stirring, strident peeps from some chicks until they were quieted with a snack of regurgitated fish.”\u0026nbspCari Mora reiterates Harris’s Ligottian cosmos. It is a world where life and matter cannibalizes itself in a storm of appetites where the true soundtrack of reality is digestion. The greed for gold and the greed for sexual satisfaction are rolled into one big human hunger, and together they are what drag Cari through a harrowing few weeks in what has already been a pretty harrowing life. The book’s atmosphere is biology, happening. That disillusionment of Darwin. Harris, who grew up in the Bible Belt, always clearly enjoyed himself with Lecter’s godlessness (the flesh-eating psychiatrist “collects church collapses, recreationally”). In Cari Mora, characters constantly say Dios se lo pague\u0026nbsp(God bless you) to one another, even as the novel’s events are quite clearly not being overseen by a benevolent actor – and indeed any such benevolent actor receives fewer mentions than the gods of that committedly cannibalistic civilisation, the Aztecs.And yet: as in the rest of Harris’s novels, it is resisting the merciless storm of predation, of organic matter consuming its other iterations, that is made noble. According to a reporter who in 1999 tracked down Harris’s childhood acquaintances, Harris struggled to makes friends in hard-bitten, Fifties Mississippi because “he wasn’t athletic at all, and even less interested in killing animals”. The bird rehabilitation centre that Cari works at is real, and in the book’s acknowledgements Harris calls it a “remarkable, humane institution”. Despite having stacked the deck against himself with admirable enthusiasm, Harris’s heroes all refuse to accept that fleshy vulnerability is the sum of things. They want to protect the meek, and minimise easy slaughter. The universe is forever dining on itself, but figures like Starling and Mora want to interrupt the meal.Lecter\u0026nbspthrillers saw the budding serial killer played by Gaspard Ulliel (Rex)In 2001, when Harris was a rather more immediate part of the fiction landscape, the critic David Sexton wrote that he “easily stands comparison with the great melodramatists of the past: Bram Stoker, Conan Doyle, Wilkie Collins or Edgar Allan Poe, say, perhaps even Robert Louis Stevenson. He will last as they have lasted.” Readers will make up\u0026nbsptheir own about this. But if his melodrama does survive, it will be because it makes grand this battle: blind, devouring cosmos, simple recycling of matter, versus a belief that the vulnerable deserve protecting, that even if the war is always being lost such small battles of compassion are worth the fighting. This belief, as Lecter would delight in reminding us, can only ever be an assertion, a sort of faith. This is a stretch, but could it be that Harris, the old Southerner, didn’t shake all of his Christianity? The cover of Cari Mora is festooned with an image of Our Lady of Charity, Catholic patroness of Cuba and that nation’s quintessential religious icon. (Miami is, of course, a Cuba away from Cuba.) “Charity,” in the biblical sense, is a fudged translation of the ancient Greek agapē, which means something more like selfless love. The animal care of Harris’s novels is a charity of this kind. A sort of defiant, doomed, selfless stand against the animal kingdom’s mindless gobbling.What stops Harris’s books from being a pure hellscape of appetite is mercy, care. This time round, his lady of charity – Cari is short for Caridad, Spanish for charity – resists pandemonium. History’s most fervent opponents of cannibalisms, we might note, were all Christian missionaries. They in turn advocated a form of cannibalism that was not only consensual but strongly encouraged, because it freed us from this animal gauntlet, Christ’s transubstantiated flesh and blood lifting us at the Last Judgement into a place where we weren’t condemned to the iron logic of the physical. Today’s Harris, it would seem, wants the feast to go differently. It is a rather ordinary thriller, but Cari Mora is interesting for being a sort of repentance: Having served Starling to a man dripping in Satan imagery, he now wishes he could snatch her, and the silence of her lambs, back from between his elegant jaws.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A bottlenose dolphin’s encephalization quotient, a measure of brain to body size ratio, is second only to that of a human.Their intelligence is part of the reason they have proven to be such successful animals. The blue whale is the largest creature ever known to have lived, weighing as much as 140 tons. The much smaller killer whale is the blue whale’s only natural threat in the sea and is an apex predator in all the world’s oceans.We also know that their intelligence evolved long before our own, tens of millions of years earlier, making it highly likely that dolphins and other toothed whales possessed the greatest intellectual power before Homo sapiens.Created with Sketch.

Tiger sharks are one of the few species of shark that do attack humans, and are known to be a menace to whales as well. For whatever reason, the whale appeared to have wanted to save Hauser and was manoeuvring her out of the way of the shark.Created with Sketch.Whale intelligence continues to be underestimated Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mom and calf humpback whales make their way toward the surface in Tonga.salto della megattera durante whale watching  in islanda, salto della balena, incredibileAn aerial photo of humpback whales in a podHumpback mother and calf, with a snorkeler, in Tonga.Humpback Whale breaching out of water in the morning light in Icelandhumpback whales playing on surface in the blue between Tahiti and MooreaA beached grey whale which died after an effort by local fishermen to pull her back out to sea.

Their underwater “songs” carry for hundreds of miles.This was not the only example of humpback whales interfering to save the lives of other species. These whales have been seen putting themselves between oceanic predators, typically killer whales, and other marine life, including the calves of other whales, seals and sunfish. Dolphins (part of the same family that includes the large baleen whales) have been known to help save drowning humans.What motivates a whale to save a human or a sunfish is unknown. It could be a form of altruism, or the result of protective instincts towards a calf, or the protection of a wider group, or another behaviour we haven’t thought of. This kind of activity seems to confirm the whale’s position in our minds as semi-mythical beings, cruising the world’s oceans singing to each other and conducting good deeds.Yet it wasn’t long ago that whales were appreciated more for their capacity to produce oil for a range of household products than for their apparent altruism.We hunted whales in their tens of thousands every year, pulling back only when their populations were on the verge of extinction and the industrial hunting of whales had become less profitable. Whaling on a significant scale continued well into the 1960s and 1970s.Our entire way of thinking about intelligence is skewed by our own perception of what it means to be smart, which inevitably involves comparing other animals against our own intelligencePart of the problem was that whales have historically been difficult to study in the wild they were seen as being akin to giant fish rather than sophisticated marine mammals, gifted with some of the largest and most complex brains ever to have evolved.“They have a very, very complicated brain,” Lori Marino, a renowned neuroscientist and expert in animal behaviour and intelligence, says.“That is something we only discovered when we started to use imaging techniques. People thought their brains were large but kind of simple, now we know that is not the case.”Marino’s work with dolphins has included the publication of conclusive evidence that bottlenose dolphins can recognise themselves in a mirror, putting themselves in the company of only a few animals, including ourselves, a few of the great apes, Asian elephants and magpies.Adapted to an environment very different to our own, the whale brain has developed to meet different needs, in a three-dimensional world where the requirements to survive and thrive do not present a ready comparison with our lives.Frustratingly, for anyone after an answer to the question of\u0026nbsp“how smart is the dolphinwhale?”,\u0026nbspthe answer is not only that we don’t know but that our capacity to answer that question is limited by both our current understanding of neuroscience and our own biases.Our entire way of thinking about intelligence is skewed by our own perception of what it means to be smart, which inevitably involves comparing other animals against our own intelligence. For today’s scientists, the question is not\u0026nbsphow smart are the whales, but in what ways can we consider them to be smart and how are they using that intelligence to succeed in their environment?iStock)“When people ask me, ‘Are dolphins smart?’ I say, ‘I don’t know, but I can tell you the ways in which they are smart,’”\u0026nbspJanet Mann, professor of biology and psychology at Georgetown University says. “What we do know is they do X, Y and Z, and if they can do those things, there must be some brain power behind it.”One hallmark of a whale’s intelligence is its ability to communicate and navigate underwater. A dolphin’s world view is necessarily more acoustic than our own, with echolocation (sonar) providing a 3D map of their surroundings that is incorporated into a visual image of their surroundings. It is processed and perceived in a way we find hard to fully understand.“They have a holistic view of what they are perceiving,” Marino says.\u0026nbsp“We might hear a sound and remember a sound but the way their brain works is echolocation mixing with the visual image, producing something like a hologram.”As dolphins “see” their world in sound, as well as communicating about their world in sound, it is likely that they are able to project an idea of what they are seeing at other members of their immediate group. The sound is transmitted as an “auditory image”, rather than requiring the brain to interpret the sound and imagine what the image might be.This is likely to be an efficient and accurate way of exchanging information between members of a group, not least because it is now thought that dolphins have an enhanced capacity to process the information their brains are receiving, possibly up to 20 times faster than a human brain.Their brains also appear to be wired up to experience a range of emotions and may have an advanced sense of self-awareness. In a killer whale, the limbic system, a part of the brain associated with emotional awareness and memory formation, is exaggerated to the point where it has formed a unique structure on the brain now known as the paralimbic lobe.In recent years, scientists have begun to speculate that this part of the brain is also responsible for a form of collective self-awareness between members of a pod.“They may have some sense of self that is spread out among\u0026nbspthe rest of their pod,” according to Marino. “What happens to members of the pod, happens to them.”It is a theory that\u0026nbspgoes some way towards explaining events like mass strandings, where an entire group of whales (often the pilot whale) beaches itself, apparently due to the distress of one particular inidual. They are highly dependent on their social networks for every element of their lives, and have a very keen sense of friend and foe, as well as close family bonds.They are cultural animals and have a lot of interesting cultural traditions that they follow which makes them something very familiar to us“With bottlenose dolphins, we can see a multi-level alliance structure,” says Mann.“In bottlenose dolphins, the community is never together all at once. To determine who is connected to who and how, among\u0026nbsphundreds or even thousands of iniduals they associate with, they must sample their network to work out who is friend or foe. We also know they can identify friends and foes partly based on the cultural behaviours that are passed down.”In the wild, examples of this “whale culture” in action includes a population of dolphins that have been seen using the body of a scorpion fish to prod a moray eel out of hiding, another puts sea sponges on their beaks to assist in the location of fish that are hiding under a rock or sand, a form of tool use.Each of these techniques demonstrates a high level of problem-solving capability, but the capacity to hand down this behaviour to future generations is of equal interest to the people studying these animals, as this shows a form of culture has developed within particular populations.“They are very cultural animals and have a lot of interesting cultural traditions that they follow which makes them something very familiar to us. That is true for belugas, orca and bottlenoses as well as other kinds of cetacean,” Marino says.“They have to depend on learning to keep those traditions going, which requires intelligence.”From the 1960s onwards, scientists started to spend significant amounts of time among\u0026nbspwhales, much of it with bottlenose dolphins in captivity. They began to realise they were dealing with creatures that possess many of the attributes we typically associate with higher levels of intelligence, namely, problem-solving, self-recognition, elements of language, complex social structures and the ability to coordinate a group in the service of hunting or the protection of young and elder members of a family.Bottlenose dolphins in marine parks and military facilities have proved to be excellent problem solvers\u0026nbspand are able to understand complicated commands issued to them by human instructors.According to\u0026nbspMann, “They can remember the signature whistle of a specific dolphin more than 20 years after they last interacted with that dolphin.“That suggests they have long-term recognition. Unlike with humans, dolphins don’t have visual stimuli like photographs to help them remember things in the intervening period.”\u0026nbspMany of the researchers who spend time with these animals say that, far from being a one-way study, the dolphins are incredibly quick-witted and seem to be testing the intelligence of the scientists, playing tricks and games with the researchers even while\u0026nbspthey are being studied.One of the most notable examples of this was a field trip in 1985 when a group of researchers looking into dolphin behaviour got bored at staring into at an empty sea and tried to find other ways of keeping themselves amused while they waited for their subject matter.To entertain his fellow crew members, one of the scientists put seaweed on his head and pretended to be Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea. He then threw the seaweed into the water and turned back his colleagues. Moments later a dolphin appeared next to the boat, with the seaweed on her head.It is possible that this was a coincidence, but dolphins are known to be excellent mimics, something that is seen by thousands of people in aquaria around the world. For scientists, this kind of playfulness, which is widely exhibited by dolphins in the wild, is also a hallmark of intelligence.As is so often the case with our oceans, when it comes to understanding and interpreting the intelligence of marine mammals, there is still a lot we don’t know. Seemingly every major study brings up new behaviours and traits that we had not considered before, or had not thought possible.One conclusion we can draw from our current knowledge is the practice of having large cetaceans in aquaria is likely to be causing the animals considerable distress.Marino no longer works with whales or dolphins in captivity and is founder and president of the Whale Sanctuary Project, which aims to retire orcas and belugas in entertainment parks to naturalistic seaside sanctuaries.“In a concrete tank they have no reason to use most of their senses,” she says “certainly not echolocation, certainly not a lot of sound as nothing is going on, there is not much to see. It is like sensory deprivation, there is nothing to do.“It is like being in a small room with the lights off and once in a while, someone gives you a sandwich under the door. It is like someone being held in solitary confinement.”How smart is a whale? We don’t know. But the question itself seems to miss the point.“I don’t think we fully understand how intelligent they are or the ways in which they are intelligent,” Marino concludes. “The ways that we recognise intelligence are the ways we recognise intelligence in ourselves. There is clearly a form of intelligence above and beyond our own in these animals but that is going to be very difficult for us to determine.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I definitely wasn’t. I was a teenager. I had just turned 18. There was no fact checking from him or his publisher – it almost feels deliberate,” the Oscar-winner told Harper’s Bazaar.She added: “That he used this story to sell his book was very disturbing to me.”Created with Sketch.The actresses fighting against sexism in Hollywood Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The 32-year-old actress said she has already experiences job rejections because of her age. “Now I\u0027m in my early thirties and I\u0027m like, \u0027Why did that 24-year-old get that part? I was that 24-year-old once. I can\u0027t be upset about it, it\u0027s the way things are,” she told Glamour. On news that Maggie Gyllenhaal had been turned down for being ‘too old’, aged 37, to play a 55-year-old man’s partner: “It’s f***ing outrageous. It’s ridiculous. Honestly, it’s so annoying. And ’twas ever thus. We all watched James Bond as he got more and more geriatric, and his girlfriends got younger and younger. It’s so annoying.”Gyllenhaal revealed she was told by a Hollywood producer that she was too old, aged 37, to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man. “It was astonishing to me. It made me feel bad, and then it made feel angry, and then it made me laugh,” she said at the time. Meryl Streep has helped fund an all-female screenwriters group called The Writer’s Lab to encourage more women to pen Hollywood scripts. She previously told Vogue in 2011: “Once women pass childbearing age they could only be seen as grotesque on some level.” The actress said she thought Hollywood is “still completely s***” when it comes to treating women equally to men. ““When I was younger, I really did think we were on our way to a better world. And when I look at it now, it is in a worse state than I have known it, particularly for women, and I find that very disturbing and sad.”“I had never seen a 49-year-old, dark-skinned woman who is not a size 2 be a sexualised role in TV or film. I\u0027m a sexual woman, but nothing in my career has ever identified me as a sexualised woman. I was the prototype of the ‘mommified’ role,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. The actress famously called out sexism on the red carpet at the 2014 Screen Actors Guild Awards. When a camera operator scanned her up and down, she said: “Do you do this to the guys?” In her Oscar acceptance speech for Blue Jasmine, she reminded the film industry that movies with leading women can still be successful. Asked if she had ever encountered sexism in Hollywood, Page told : ‘Oh my God, yeah! It\u0027s constant! It\u0027s how you\u0027re treated, it\u0027s how you\u0027re looked at, how you\u0027re expected to look in a photoshoot, it\u0027s how you\u0027re expected to shut up and not have an opinion, it\u0027s how you... If you\u0027re a girl and you don\u0027t fit the very specific vision of what a girl should be, which is always from a man\u0027s perspective, then you\u0027re a little bit at a loss.”The actress says she refuses roles where she has to play the generic girlfriend, wife or sexy bombshell. It\u0027s very hard being a woman in a man\u0027s world, and I recognised it was a man\u0027s world even when I was a kid. It\u0027s an inequality and injustice that drove me crazy, and which I always spoke out against — and I\u0027ve always been outspoken,” she told Manhattan magazine. The actress spoke to ELLE about negotiating equal pay for the Snow White and the Huntsman sequel: This is a good time for us to bring this to a place of fairness, and girls need to know that being a feminist is a good thing. It doesn\u0027t mean that you hate men. It means equal rights. If you\u0027re doing the same job, you should be compensated and treated in the same way.The 32-year-old actress said she has already experiences job rejections because of her age. “Now I\u0027m in my early thirties and I\u0027m like, \u0027Why did that 24-year-old get that part? I was that 24-year-old once. I can\u0027t be upset about it, it\u0027s the way things are,” she told Glamour. On news that Maggie Gyllenhaal had been turned down for being ‘too old’, aged 37, to play a 55-year-old man’s partner: “It’s f***ing outrageous. It’s ridiculous. Honestly, it’s so annoying. And ’twas ever thus. We all watched James Bond as he got more and more geriatric, and his girlfriends got younger and younger. It’s so annoying.”Gyllenhaal revealed she was told by a Hollywood producer that she was too old, aged 37, to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man. “It was astonishing to me. It made me feel bad, and then it made feel angry, and then it made me laugh,” she said at the time. Meryl Streep has helped fund an all-female screenwriters group called The Writer’s Lab to encourage more women to pen Hollywood scripts. She previously told Vogue in 2011: “Once women pass childbearing age they could only be seen as grotesque on some level.” The actress said she thought Hollywood is “still completely s***” when it comes to treating women equally to men. ““When I was younger, I really did think we were on our way to a better world. And when I look at it now, it is in a worse state than I have known it, particularly for women, and I find that very disturbing and sad.”“I had never seen a 49-year-old, dark-skinned woman who is not a size 2 be a sexualised role in TV or film. I\u0027m a sexual woman, but nothing in my career has ever identified me as a sexualised woman. I was the prototype of the ‘mommified’ role,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. The actress famously called out sexism on the red carpet at the 2014 Screen Actors Guild Awards. When a camera operator scanned her up and down, she said: “Do you do this to the guys?” In her Oscar acceptance speech for Blue Jasmine, she reminded the film industry that movies with leading women can still be successful. Asked if she had ever encountered sexism in Hollywood, Page told : ‘Oh my God, yeah! It\u0027s constant! It\u0027s how you\u0027re treated, it\u0027s how you\u0027re looked at, how you\u0027re expected to look in a photoshoot, it\u0027s how you\u0027re expected to shut up and not have an opinion, it\u0027s how you... If you\u0027re a girl and you don\u0027t fit the very specific vision of what a girl should be, which is always from a man\u0027s perspective, then you\u0027re a little bit at a loss.”The actress says she refuses roles where she has to play the generic girlfriend, wife or sexy bombshell. It\u0027s very hard being a woman in a man\u0027s world, and I recognised it was a man\u0027s world even when I was a kid. It\u0027s an inequality and injustice that drove me crazy, and which I always spoke out against — and I\u0027ve always been outspoken,” she told Manhattan magazine. The actress spoke to ELLE about negotiating equal pay for the Snow White and the Huntsman sequel: This is a good time for us to bring this to a place of fairness, and girls need to know that being a feminist is a good thing. It doesn\u0027t mean that you hate men. It means equal rights.

Dean Turner, UK economist as UBS Wealth Management, forecast that the pound could crash to as low as 1.15 against the dollar and close to parity against the euro in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He warned investors not to be complacent about the prospect.“Despite mounting public impatience over the process, many top officials and lawmakers remain fearful of the economic damage from a no-deal exit,” said Mr Turner.“Lingering uncertainty would likely cause firms to delay investment, and keep sterling under downward pressure.”“A UK decision to remain an EU member would likely cause a swift rebound in sterling, which we believe is undervalued relative to its purchasing power parity level of around USD 1.58.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But there is no indication her likely successor will be any better.”Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, said: “These figures show that the UK is continuing to attract skilled workers like doctors and nurses who play a vital role in supporting our communities and boosting our economy.\u0026nbsp“Net migration continues to be stable and as we leave the EU our new immigration system will give us greater control over who comes here, while ensuring employers have the access to the skills they need.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She has done nothing to reverse the sexist austerity policy-making of the Conservative and coalition governments. We know from research carried out by the House of Commons that women are bearing 86 per cent of the burden of austerity.\u0026nbsp“The mistake or assumption people make is that any woman in power is automatically going to address gender equality and women’s rights. What we actually need\u0026nbspis a woman\u0026nbspwith a clear analysis of women’s discrimination and oppression at the centre of their world view, and for this to be what is driving them to be in politics in the first place.

Her failure to address structural inequality means she has not achieved gender equality.”The Labour politician noted some 54,000 women have lost their jobs due to maternity discrimination – adding that charges to employment tribunals had meant the number of women taking cases out about maternity discrimination had fallen by almost half.The draft domestic abuse bill is too narrow, she also said, arguing that it fails to “guarantee women’s protection or high enough support”.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s legacy is to have destroyed the hopes of my generationThe legislation has also faced criticism from leading domestic violence charities for failing to protect migrant women, whose perpetrators use immigration status as a “weapon to abuse” them – as well for failing to offer protection for women in Northern Ireland.Grainne Teggart, Amnesty’s Northern Ireland campaign manager who has repeatedly hit out the landmark bill for excluding Northern Ireland, attacked Ms May for her track record on abortion.There had been plans for an amendment to the domestic abuse bill, with the aim of liberalising abortion laws in Northern Ireland, which has a ban on abortions in almost all cases – even rape or incest. However, the bill was published with provisions only for England and Wales.“The government under Theresa May has failed women in Northern Ireland on abortion. They had the opportunity to decriminalise it but she has stayed silent,” she said. “We will never accept women’s rights and abortion rights being sacrificed for political expediency. Northern Ireland has one of the strictest abortion laws in the world.”\u0026nbspShe added: “It is long overdue that the government stood by women in Northern Ireland and every day the law is not changed, the UK government is complicit in the harm and neglect of women there. Women here face potentially up to life in prison for having an abortion that is illegal and abortion remains illegal in almost every circumstance.”\u0026nbspMs May’s allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), on whom she relies for her Commons majority, are staunchly opposed to relaxing abortion laws.Theresa May resigns: Read the prime minister’s speech in fullSam Smethers, the Fawcett Society’s chief executive, said it was important not to overlook some of Ms May’s achievements on women’s rights – noting that it was her\u0026nbspwho had co-founded Women2Win, a Tory group that supported David Cameron’s commitment to select elect more women to parliament.\u0026nbsp“But it is a mixed bag,” she added. “Politicians always are. They have not done enough on domestic violence. Welfare reform and universal credit have been an absolute car crash – it has harmed some of the poorest families and women. But where she can, she has taken forward an agenda that has helped women’s rights. Having said that, Brexit is potentially very damaging to women’s rights. She has really made some big mistakes and we are all paying the price now. But she has been dealt the hardest hand of any post-war leader. The bandwidth for anything in government outside Brexit has been very small.”Ms Smethers noted that the treatment Ms May has endured from her Conservative colleagues has been “overtly misogynistic” at times – saying that while they had “made her life” very difficult, she had also made her own life difficult.\u0026nbspMs May, who has introduced protection orders for women at risk of domestic violence and FGM and made a new criminal offence of coercive and controlling behaviour, has also been previously criticised by Labour MP Yvette Cooper for allowing “the state-sanctioned abuse of women” in Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But appears to be suffering from the curse of being one of the frontrunners in the Tory race. His stock has fallen recently after what some MPs see as unforced errors such as his handling of\u0026nbspmigrants crossing the English channel and his decision to strip Isis schoolgirl Shamima Begum of her UK citizenship.Remainer who briefly supported a Final Say referendum on the Brexit deal after the 2016 vote. Now rejects the idea, and is seen as a born-again Brexiteer who also wants to keep a no-deal departure on the table.His pitch would be as the candidate who could unite the Tories’ warring factions. Tory members might judge him too much of a Remainer. Critics worry that his long stint as\u0026nbsphealth secretary\u0026nbspcould return to haunt him at a general election. Could benefit from a slide in Javid’s fortunes, but will not want to overtake him to become\u0026nbspthe frontrunner.Along with Johnson, headed the victorious Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum. Even his critics admit he is one of the few successful departmental ministers since his surprise return to May’s cabinet in 2017, a year after she sacked him.Has been a loyal and articulate promoter of the withdrawal agreement. Critics see this as in part an attempt to shed his reputation as an assassin who turned on\u0026nbspJohnson\u0026nbspto run for the leadership in 2016.Gove’s\u0026nbsprefusal to join other Brexiteers in resigning from the cabinet might count against him among\u0026nbspEurosceptics. However, many of them are now coming round to his strategy of getting the deal “over the line” to save Brexit.Eurosceptic former chief of staff to David Davis, and followed his path by becoming and then resigning as Brexit secretary, complaining he was kept out of the loop by May and her civil service negotiator Olly Robbins. Displayed a grip on the detail while in the job, and impressed May allies in the 2016 referendum when he campaigned for Leave.\u0026nbspBut did not impress Brussels officials.A fresh face, although his relative lack of cabinet experience could count against him. But a\u0026nbspdark horse to watch in a leadership race. Has a big decision to make: will he back May’s deal if Johnson\u0026nbspdoes, or decide to have clean hands and oppose it to the end, and potentially be on the losing side?A new entrant in the leadership race and, at 40, could be the youngest candidate. A rare breed in the May government as a survivor of David Cameron’s regime: before becoming an MP in 2010, he was chief of staff to George Osborne. Impressed as culture secretary, as one of the few UK politicians to understand the digital era and power of the internet giants. Has also shown grip in a testing job since his promotion to health and social care secretary.Smooth media performer who does not lack ambition. Described by some MPs as “a better version of Jeremy Hunt”, he is Remainer-turned-Leaver who could unite his fractious party. Has gone into bat for May’s deal when others kept their head down. Could be part of a “stop Boris” drive in which Johnson’s rivals try to share out MPs’ votes to keep him off the shortlist.

But, compared to her predecessors, she had the least impact and influence as leader of the United Kingdom on the wider field of international relations.Ms May’s government was consumed by the convulsions of Brexit. And, ironically it was that issue, one that was supposed to launch an unfettered leap to “Global Britain” which resulted instead in a retreat of British foreign policy, rendering this nation’s view less and less important on issues of global importance.Ms May, who once\u0026nbspdeclared\u0026nbspin a speech that “if you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere”, had sought to wrap herself in the Union flag to gain favour with her party’s right wing.\u0026nbspOther prime ministers who had been super-patriotic, especially Margaret Thatcher, whom Ms May often compared herself to, had a robust and forthright foreign policy. But the May government was hamstrung by what it saw as the all-consuming need for trade deals after Brexit, making it extremely wary of offending authoritarian states and rulers.There was, for instance, a good reason why Turkish president\u0026nbspRecep Tayyip Erdogan chose Britain in May last year as the destination for his high-profile foreign visit after calling an election.Created with Sketch.Theresa May gets emotional during her resignation  Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement outside at 10 Downing Street in London, where she announced she is standing down as Tory party leader on Friday June 7.Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement outside at 10 Downing Street in London, where she announced she is standing down as Tory party leader on Friday June 7.There was little chance of Ms May’s government embarrassing him by saying or doing anything about the state of human rights in Turkey and the tens of thousands imprisoned in retribution after the failed coup in the country.Erdogan was keen to press the point home during his trip, saying: “We are very ready to cooperate with the UK post-Brexit in every field ...\u0026nbspI see the strategic partnership between Turkey and the UK as a necessity for the interests of the two countries.” He added: “The UK will need trade after Brexit\u0026nbspand, rest assured, Turkey is willing to help.”There were plenty of other examples of the desire not to jeopardise lucrative prospective deals by offending leaderships that abused human rights and flouted international law, the latter of particular resonance as the UK is supposedly dedicated to championing the Rules Based International System.Indeed, Downing Street\u0026nbspunder Theresa May\u0026nbsphad been quick to stamp down on ministers who raised inconvenient concerns. When Boris Johnson, then the foreign secretary, complained that Saudi Arabia was “playing proxy wars” and “puppeteering” in the Middle East, the prime minister’s official spokesperson\u0026nbspwas quick to that his views did not reflect government policy, saying:\u0026nbsp“Those are the foreign secretary’s views, they are not the government’s position on Saudi Arabia and its role in region.”Ms May let it be known that Mr Johnson was over-reaching and being irresponsible by speaking in that way about a valued ally.Theresa May \u0027rolled back women’s rights as Prime Minister\u0027The disagreement with Mr Johnson was in December 2016. The bombs and missiles from the Saudi-led coalition\u0026nbspcontinued to rain down in the bloody conflict in Yemen, killing and maiming tens of thousands of people, while Britain has made a huge amount of money selling these weapons.One of the latest examples of turning on ministers who had annoyed oppressive but potentially lucrative regimes came when Gavin Williamson proposed sending the aircraft carrier, Queen Elizabeth, to the disputed waters of the China Seas to uphold the right of navigation.His speech was overfull with phrases of imperial hubris, of “East of Suez”\u0026nbspand “Pax Britannica”. But there was nothing intrinsically wrong with upholding international law by sailing in these waters. Other countries –\u0026nbspthe US, Japan, Australia and India – have all done that.But even as the then defence secretary was finishing his speech at the Royal United Services Institute,\u0026nbspDowning Street was briefing journalists that Mr Williamson was jeopardising trade deals with China.Mr Williamson was later sacked for allegedly leaking a National Security Council (NSC) decision to allow the Chinese multinational, Huawei, into the UK’s telecommunications network –\u0026nbspa charge he vehemently denies. The decision was driven, we know from multiple sources, by Ms May, against the wishes of a number of cabinet ministers.Britain is under great pressure now on the Huawei decision, especially\u0026nbspafter\u0026nbspUS claims\u0026nbspthat the company is a secret arm of the Chinese state. Huawei denies this, but a number of other European allies, as well as Australia and New Zealand, have placed restrictions on the company over the same suspicions.The Chinese are trying to head off a possible UK ban on Huawei. Beijing’s charge d’affaires in London, Chen Wen, has warned that there could be “substantial” repercussions for her country’s investment in Britain if measures are taken against the company.It is unlikely that any of the potential Tory successors to Ms May will allow Huawei into Britain’s 5G network –\u0026nbspthe strong opposition from the Trump administration is likely to be too strong to withstand for a UK taking faltering steps outside the European Union and dependent more than ever on the supposed “special relationship”.It may well be that had Ms May stayed in power and\u0026nbspbecome\u0026nbsp“strong and stable” after successful negotiations out of the EU,\u0026nbspestablishing\u0026nbsptrade and security partnerships, she would have pursued a more forthright, even a more moral, foreign policy.But that did not happen. Winston Churchill once dismissed Neville Chamberlain as “a Birmingham municipal councillor who looked at foreign affairs through the wrong end of a municipal drainpipe”. Theresa May, it can be said, looked at foreign affairs through the viewpoint of a somewhat desperate door-to-door saleswoman. It was a demeaning position for a nation that still aspires to global greatness.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But in truth these efforts started months ago, according to leaks from officials, as pre-election polls always predicted the BJP would win – just not by such a margin.Created with Sketch.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party have a commanding lead in early vote counting from the country\u0027s six-week general election.Mr Modi has long said his priority is the economic development of India – his most enduring slogan has been “sabka saath, sabka vikas”, meaning “collective efforts, inclusive growth”.With unemployment at its highest rate in decades, the economy slowing, and major infrastructure like the railways in a sorry state, the BJP knows it needs to be seen to be delivering more if it is to cement its place at the top of Indian politics for many years to come.After some rogue assembly election results in December rattled the party’s confidence, Mr Modi made some big promises in the hope of winning over any hesitant voters.They include a pledge to double farmers’ incomes, to make India the world’s third largest economy by 2030 and to spend more than £1.1 trillion –\u0026nbspfour times the country’s annual budget –\u0026nbspon improved infrastructure.\u0026nbsp“The programmes Mr Modi has promised in the past, even those seen as successes like Clean India and the provision of cheap cooking gas, have huge shortfalls, and it would be prudent for the government to plug the gaps and see them mature,” said political scientist and author Ajay Mehra, currently working on a book on the prime ministers of India.Narendra Modi wins reelection with commanding landslideWhile Mr Modi might want to focus on the challenge of the economy, that’s not the main reason many of supporters voted for him.Asked what she wants to see from this second term, BJP Delhi worker Pinkesh Rana said her first priorities were “articles 35A and 370”.It’s a reference to the rules that give Jammu and Kashmir special status in the constitution, allowing the state to restrict who it allows to become a permanent resident and thereby maintaining its unique demography as the only Muslim-majority state in India.The BJP has promised to do away with the articles – and this is just one of its social policies that invoke the fervour of its Hindu nationalist base and leave\u0026nbspthe country’s 180 million Muslims feeling under threat.Ms Rana’s second priority? “I hope he works in the next five years to build the temple,” she says, meaning the temple to Lord Ram that many Hindus want to see built in Ayodhya on the site where an important mosque was pulled down by right-wing rioters in 1992.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIndia braces for Kashmir backlash as ‘most wanted’ militant shot deadIndia’s Modi wins reelection in ‘absolutely stunning’ landslideModi’s election win is a victory for far right Hindu nationalismHundreds of armed masked men snatch voting machines in India electionMeet the women who are fighting in India’s ‘toxic’ electionIndian election exit polls suggest victory for prime minister ModiMr Mehra says the “minuscule” opposition will struggle to stand up for India’s founding secular ideology and stop the BJP pushing its Hindu-first agenda on others.“They will be able to say that minorities are just that, we are the majority, and what we say goes. So if they say nobody should eat beef, nobody will eat beef. If they say there should be no cow slaughter, then it will be so. And if they say that cities with Muslim names must change, then they will.And what about that opposition? This election has provided yet another miserable result for the Grand Old Party of Indian politics, the Congress, which has ruled the country for the majority of the years since independence but now seems to be in freefall.Congress won just 52 seats in Thursday’s results, up only eight on its historic worst-ever performance in 2014 – and that despite supposedly having anti-incumbency sentiment in its favour.The final blow, it seems, has been the failure of Congress chief Rahul Gandhi to secure his home constituency, Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, where the scions of the Nehru-Gandhi family have ruled for generations.Mr Gandhi offered to resign as party president in the aftermath of the results but looks set to have his offer rejected.Modi’s election win is a victory for far right Hindu nationalismYet if he stays on, and if efforts continue to promote his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as a successor, then it is difficult to see how the party can shake off its image, hammered home in BJP messaging, of being simply a vehicle to empower one political dynasty.For while BJP workers say the win was “100 per cent Modi”, behind the figure of one strong leader is a team of well known and well liked politicians all pushing in the same direction.If Congress cannot rediscover its base of support and establish itself as a party with more credible leaders across the nation than just the Gandhi siblings, then it is difficult to see how the party can offer an effective nationwide opposition going forwards.The problem with Indian politics is that elections come thick and fast – four states are due to hold their legislative assembly polls later this year. After this trouncing, Congress doesn’t have long to conduct a post mortem and bounce back – if it can do so at all.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In fact, Amy was an A-grade student who went off the rails at  after suffering a serious sexual assault by a fellow pupil. Her behaviour deteriorated and she ended up being excluded from school and sent to one of the country’s  Pupil Referral Units .Amy - who met the Duchess of Cambridge earlier this month - is far from alone. Permanent exclusions in Britain have soared by an incredible  per cent in just three years, rising from , in   to , in  .And a staggering , pupils a year are illegally ‘off-rolled’ - the controversial practice of removing dficult or struggling kids from the school register to boost exam results.This week, as teens across the country knuckle down to their GCSEs, The Sun lts the lid on the scandal of Britain’s rising number of ‘Unteachable’ kids - those who are excluded, off-rolled and disappear from our education system.Many of the , kids excluded every day from British schools  end up in PRUs, which officials have described as ‘hotbeds’ of gang grooming and sex attacks.They’re designed to house pupils with Special Educational Needsor behavioural issues, but the reality, according to Amy, is that all too often they become a dumping ground for vulnerable or dficult youngsters, some as young as five.For her part, Amy, who helped the Duchess of Cambridge launch the new Pears Family School for excluded children in London, says she had a loving and happy childhood. “I was very much loved as a child,” she recalls. “My parents worked tirelessly to make sure my needs were met and that I had opportunities to do extra-curricular things.”The young Amy dreamed of becoming a doctor or a police officer but that all changed when she was  and suffered a serious sexual assault by a male pupil at her secondary school. Amy went immediately to the police, only to be told there wasn’t enough evidence to take action against her teenage attacker.  As a result, he was allowed to stay at the school, meaning that a terried Amy saw him most days, often coming within inches of him in the school corridor. , students excluded from school every day on averageVulnerable and isolated, Amy retreated into herself, turning to drink to numb her fear: on one occasion running off during school time to buy alcohol. When she became disruptive, she found herself permanently excluded.“No one referred me to an emotional well-being service,” she says. “I was a really good student at the time, but no-one understood or listened.”Forced outside the mainstream education system, Amy ended up at two dferent PRUs. At one, she was the lone girl in a school filled with boys - a terrying prospect for any young woman, let alone one who had been sexually assaulted. It’s a frighteningly common situation: for every girl, three boys are permanently excluded. Surrounded by a classroom full of boys every day, Amy’s schoolmates would constantly pester her and try to “outdo each other” to grab her attention.“No one was focusing on learning, that was the last of priorities,” she says. “The main focus was not being the weakest one – otherwise you were at risk of being the victim of manipulation.”Amy claims that at one of the PRUs, even the most basic needs were barely being met: while she used to enjoy hot meals at her secondary school, she claims she was given only a sandwich for lunch – with just one slice of bread.“You got no food, you got no education, no-one was there to protect you from a fight breaking out,” she says.“I know quite a few people did go out to the shops and just take something. Kids are just trying to survive.“I even knew people in the PRU that used to threaten others with a kne just for money for food because of how hungry they were.”And so the girl who once aspired to being a doctor had to settle for studying only four GCSEs – one below the five required to get into further education.She’s not alone in this - only one per cent of PRU students achieve five good GCSEs.“One of those only had an hour of teaching for the whole thing,” she says. “We only got one hour a week for the other three GCSEs.” It’s far from uncommon: more than  per cent of PRU pupils become NEETwhen they leave aged , while % of those in Young Offenders’ Institutions have been excluded.Chair of the Education Committee and Tory MP Robert Halfon, who has backed our series, warns that by the time a child arrives at a PRU they are on a ‘collision course with failure’. Amy was one of the lucky ones: a teaching assistant at her unit, recognising her potential, introduced her to a local college teacher who took the time to understand her story and enrolled her for A-levels.“After spilling out my le story, [the college staff] came to an understanding of the circumstances and understood the extent of the trauma that disrupted my le, she says.“I often still think about the kindness shown that day and the huge risk they took. I hadn’t been prone to that type of understanding and kindness for years, so I was overwhelmed.”Returning to mainstream education wasn’t easy though: accustomed to being on the defensive, Amy frequently clashed with other pupils.  Despite her struggles, she passed her A-Levels, enough to secure a course in politics and international relations at Kent University, graduating last year with a :. “Mum and dad were so proud,” she says. “It was one of the happiest days of their lives, because no-one from a PRU goes directly to further education and then directly to higher education.”Today, Amy is studying for a masters in international social policy and acting as a “young champion” for the Anna Freud Centrein King’s Cross.The Centre’s patron is the Duchess of Cambridge, who came to open the new Pears Family School, a facility for  children, aged five to , who have been excluded from school for bad behaviour, caused by ‘conduct disorders’ and emotional issues.She says: The negative stereotype of children in PRUs is not true.Its just that not many people take the time to talk and listen to them to understand their social background struggles and dficulties that they are exhaustingly fighting.We need to start including them and signying their voice among society so no one gets left behind.The Duchess - who has long been a passionate campaigner for mental health awareness and children’s well-being – was there when Amy delivered a short, powerful speech about her exclusion and sex abuse, and the two later met. “If someone said to me eight years ago I’d be at the school, meeting Kate, I wouldn’t have believed it,” laughs Amy. “She was beautul inside and out.”The Duchess of Cambridge’s new initiative may have shone light on the issue of Britain’s ‘unteachables’, but there is no quick solution to the tens of thousands of kids who have been turfed out of our schools.According to statutory guidance released by the Department for Education, such action should only be taken:Reasons for exclusion might include bullying, arson, vandalism, drug dealing, alcohol abuse, persistant disruptive behaviour, physical assault or racist abuse,.Youngsters who repeatedly fail to either follow academic instruction or complete a behavioural sanction, like a detention, may also find themselves kicked out.For who is to blame  While some teachers argue that lazy parents with no respect for authority are raising a generation of children so badly behaved that they have no choice but to exclude them, others cite ambitious headteachers desperate to massage their exam results and net bigger pay packets and promotions.Whatever the answer, Amy is clear about one thing - we mustn’t forget about these children.At the end of the day they are just human beings.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Professor Alston wrote a similar report saying much the same thing just last November.A year ago, it was the turn of the UN’s absurdly named Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms Of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance to put the boot into Britain, claiming that Brexit had sparked “explicit racial, ethnic and religious intolerance”.Those were the words of Professor Tendayi Achiume, a Zambian who teaches law at the University of Calornia at Los Angeles.If she wants to witness some racial tension she could, of course, just poke her nose out of her faculty window and observe what is going on in the US, where last year police shot dead , people — with black people twice as likely to be killed as white people.Yet it is always Britain which is singled out for condemnation. It is a disgraceful way for the UN to treat its fth-biggest contributor.This year, Britain will pay £million into the UN’s ­coffers — . per cent of its total budget, in spite of Britain ­having less than one per cent of the world’s population.By contrast, the UN has developed a habit of pouring praise on the governments of some of the world’s most wretched countries.While Venezuela has descended into the mire, UN figures have held it up as a shining example.In , the President of the UN General Assembly said: “What Venezuela has achieved with regards to the Millennium Development Goals should serve as a model for all other countries.”Then last week, delegates at the UN Human Rights Council inexplicably poured praise on North Korea — yes, Kim Jong-un’s North Korea with its public executions and forced-labour camps.The UN has become a strange world of inverted ­values where dictators are held up as heroes while democracies such as Britain are condemned.This perhaps has something to do with the fact many of the  states recognised by the UN are themselves lousily governed. Around  are outright dictatorships and another  have elements of dictatorship.UN officials love giving a poke in the eye to Britain — which was once, of course, colonial master to many of these countries.But there is another reason why Britain tends to show up badly in UN reports. It is easy for their special rapporteurs to pick through data on Britain because we are scrupulous about keeping it.When, for example, Professor Alston claims Britain has million people living in ­“poverty”, he is quoting an experimental measure of financial wellbeing developed by the Government only last year — and including things such as childcare costs, which have never previously been taken into account.Similarly, the claim about .million people in “destitution” comes from a report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation measuring the number of people who find themselves temporarily unable to meet bills for their basic needs.It is hardly to be compared with genuine destitution, where people suffer permanent ­hunger, lack of shelter and fresh water.True, there are many people in Britain who struggle ­financially — but official ­poverty ­figures are relative.We define as poor anyone who has a household income below  per cent of the “median” household income.By way of example, in – median household income in the UK was £ per week before housing costs while “mean” — or typical — household income was £.Yet many people who qualy as “poor” in Britain would be considered very well off in many parts of the world, where incomes are generally much lower.As for Professor Alston’s claim that our Government has destroyed the welfare state, this is nonsense.According to the Office for Budgetary Responsibility, £billion will be spent on the welfare state this year — taking into account state health and education as well as benefits.Of this, £billion will be spent specically on social ­security payments — excluding the state pension.While spending has remained pretty flat over the past decade, when adjusted for inflation it is still signicantly higher than it was  years ago.As for the number of households officially living in ­poverty, that has been pretty flat over the past decade, too.But because we use a ­relative measure of poverty, the poverty line is drawn at a higher level than it was ten years ago.All this seems to have passed Professor Alston by.He seems simply to have vacuumed up the propaganda of left-wing academics and campaign groups who would always cry out for more to be spent on welfare, no matter how much is already being spent.On reflection, though, I think there is scope for the Government to spend an extra £million a year onBritain’s poor — by redirecting the money we send annually to the UN.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is hard to justy anything . This election should not even be taking place.We have one caveat: Tory MEP Dan Hannan would be a loss. The Westminster chaos is not his doing.The stalwart Leave campaigner is the brightest and best-informed MEP we have.

That’s a tall order.The second is to probe why private firm Greybull, which bought it for £, presides over so many corporate disasters.But under EU rules the Government cannot pour state aid directly into a failing business. Nor should it.It should spend millions instead retraining those workers and funding tax breaks to lure new firms to Scunthorpe.Admittedly, that would require a coherent industrial strategy Britain lacks.But the Tories must not abandon this community whose livelihoods are at risk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If not, whichever party has the most votes then gets the seat instead.The original vote count of the largest party in each round is ided by one plus the total number of seats they have already been allocated, until all the seats for the region have been handed out.Although the method is considered to be one of the most constant and representative forms of voting, the results do not exactly reflect the votes, as this would lead to parties winning fractions of seats.EU voters go to the polls every five years to elect Members of the European Parliament .Each country has a specic number of seats based on their population size.The smallest is Malta and they have six seats, whereas the largest is Germany with .There are  MEPs in total and the UK has .Candidates can stand independently or with a party.They will represent a region of their country, and the number of MEPs for each region depends on population.The government confirmed the country would be taking part in the EU elections in early May after May administration was forced to push back the date it was leaving the bloc because MPs could not get a majority for her withdrawal agreement.As the UK was still in the EU at the time of the elections it is forced to take part even though the majority of voters said they wanted to leave in the referendum vote.The UK went to the polls to elect MEPs on May , .The vote is said to have cost around £million to hold.If a Brexit deal is agreed before the election date or soon after then the UK’s MEPS will not take their seats.Butthat doesn’t happen then the newly elected MEPs will take their place in the European Parliament – which sits in Brussels and Strasbourg - in early July.European Council President Donald Tusk has said that MEPs could sit for “months or even longer”the negotiations drag on.At this stage, how long the UK MEPs will continue to sit is anyones guess.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Treachery amid the herbaceous borders.Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned at the stitch-up because vicar’s daughter May had behaved atrociously.Same this week. She held a long meeting with Cabinet ministers to agreeon one course of action.Off sauntered Mrs May to make a speech proposing a markedly dferent course of action — a concession on a second EU referendum.You can’t blame Andrea Leadsom for quitting in fury.  When a PM goes rogue like that, anger is legitimate. Actually, it becomes necessary.Theresa May, a former bank worker and local councillor, entered the Commons in .Her Maidenhead seat had such a hefty “True Blue” majority that she felt she never needed to fear the voters.From the outset it was obvious that this slender, slightly bloodless backbencher would prosper. Not that she made brilliant speeches. Good heavens no. But she had that sheen of apparent competence that today’s managers have made their own.Youthful Theresa spoke the bland bureaucratic lingo and she did so with safely modulated rhythms. She never led, never resisted. She had Establishment printed all over her.She did politics the way the Tunnock’s factory makes tea-cakes. Everything was tidily wrapped. The outer coating was tempting. It was only when you bit into it that you realised how insubstantial she was.As Tory chairman in  she made a conference speech telling activists they were regarded as “the nasty party”.This created a sensation, London commentators saying she was right to shake shires Tories out of their delusions.But the volunteers, driven more by a sense of honour than clever-clever strategy, felt insulted. May had scored an own goal and weakened her political base. It was a mistake she would repeat as PM.She never suspected that speech would cause such a stink. Instead of revelling in her new-found prominence, she retreated to obscurity.Some politicians are always on the hunt for headlines. Not May. Anti-populism was more her thing. She became known as “Submarine May”, seldom surfacing, seldom making radio contact with high command, just prowling the deep.In the long years of Tory opposition she was shadow secretary of state for education, transport, local government, environment, culture and pensions and shadow leader of the Commons. “Shadow” was indeed the word.She was at best a penumbral figure. In none of these briefs did she do anything radical.Tory leaders kept her because she did not make gaffes, was sleaze-free her marriage to stockbroker Philip, one year her junior, was enviably strong and because every front bench needs a few bores.The occasional dullard makes the bright ones feel better about themselves.Her low-key approach was fine as a mere frontbencher, even as Home Secretary.She waded dutully through her red boxes. Once or twice she showed a sliver of political ankle. With the encouragement of Fleet Street, she blocked the extradition to the US of computer hacker Gary McKinnon.It surprised her boss, David Cameron, as much as anyone.May had kept the matter tightly to herself, chewing on it alone. She took on the Police Federation, whose leaders at that time probably deserved squashing a bit.Her longevity at the Home Office started to become part of her appeal. May was a stayer in a tricky job. So said everyone. Maybe she started to believe she was indestructible.Was she clever  Not startlingly so. But she was dogged.She was never caught out by a question of detail. In the ‘chillaxed’ Cameron government, that made her unusual.Not an easy colleague, though. She feuded with George Osborne and Michael Gove. A more silken operator would have smoothed down such squabbles.Come the EU referendum of , the submarine went into a deep e.May had been thought to be a closet Eurosceptic and the Camerons were relieved when she came out in support of Remain. That was about the last they saw of her.Mind you, given her uselessness at campaigning — which became so painfully apparent in  — they were lucky.If she had fronted any Remain rallies, the Leave vote might have gone even higher.Some accused her of cowardice in hiding from the fray but it meant that when Cameron quit, and leadership contenders contrived to blow their chances, May was acceptable as Brexit Britain’s new PM.“Brexit means Brexit and we’re going to make a success of it,” she claimed.  Her time at No  has, at times, been hard to watch.Worst moment was probably that  conference speech when her voice failed. What a farce that was.Her descent has been dizzyingly fast. In February , the Tories won the Copeland by-election. That was the high-water mark.Days later she went walking in Snowdonia and called a snap election. She went into the campaign  points ahead in the polls. And she blew it.Was it cockiness  Her lack of elan  Her turgid “strong and stable” slogan Okay, we Brits like an underdog but the Tories and Labour had promised to honour the Leave result and we naively believed them. Whatever the reason, May lost.From that moment her power shrivelled. She did have some merits. Her physical stamina, particularly for a diabetic, has been remarkable. Downing Street under her was much freer of shysters and crooks than it was in the Blair and Cameron years.She did not send loads of cronies to the Lords. She was polite, unlike phone-chucker Brown. She was uninterested in the shallow, celebrity world and continued to attend church most Sundays, even when political hassles were at their worst.There was seriousness about her, certainly. Yet that lack of vanity and modern vibes, on one level so honourable, became a handicap. Politics is salesmanship. If you can create an aura of excitement, it helps you to sell policies.May just bored the smalls off us. And she surrounded herself with inadequates. Some of her ministers were rank D-listers. The civil servants seized power and the electorate’s will went ignored.Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill may have thought he was helping her but in his sly attempt to bypass Brexit he has killed his mistress.For a woman so often hailed as stubborn, she proved a terrible pushover in the dealings with Brussels.And the “Bloody dficult woman”, as Ken Clarke called her, was equally feeble in standing up to Remainer ministers like Philip Hammond and Greg Clark.Was she incompetent  Or did shewant the softest of EU exits all along  Certainly looks that way.She might have got away with it had Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party not leapt out of nowhere. That has put that fear of bejaysus up Tory and Labour MPs.Mrs May might never had felt much need to heed the electorate but MPs in marginal seats are more alert to public sentiment.And public sentiment is now molten against May. Her premiership was only about Brexit. No other policy had a look-in.Her inability to deliver that central mission makes the verdict brutal but unavoidable: This stonewall warrior, secretive, robotic, dithery in an age that demands wit and clarity, was, as a PM, the most monumental dud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Le depends on compromise.He was right.As we strive to find the compromises we need in our politics – whether to deliver Brexit, or to restore devolved government in Northern Ireland – we must remember what brought us here.Because the referendum was not just a call to leave the EU but for profound change in our country.A call to make the United Kingdom a country that truly works for everyone. I am proud of the progress we have made over the last three years.We have completed the work that David Cameron and George Osborne started: the deficit is almost eliminated, our national debt is falling and we are bringing an end to austerity.My focus has been on ensuring that the good jobs of the future will be created in communities across the whole country, not just in London and the South East, through our Modern Industrial Strategy.We have helped more people than ever enjoy the security of a job.We are building more homes and helping first-time buyers onto the housing ladder - so young people can enjoy the opportunities their parents did.And we are protecting the environment, eliminating plastic waste, tackling climate change and improving air quality.This is what a decent, moderate and patriotic Conservative Government, on the common ground of British politics, can achieve - even as we tackle the biggest peacetime challenge any government has faced.I know that the Conservative Party can renew itself in the years ahead.That we can deliver Brexit and serve the British people with policies inspired by our values.Security freedom opportunity.Those values have guided me throughout my career.But the unique privilege of this office is to use this  to give a voice to the voiceless, to fight the burning injustices that still scar our society.That is why I put proper funding for mental health at the heart of our NHS long-term plan.It is why I am ending the postcode lottery for survivors of domestic abuse.It is why the Race Disparity Audit and gender pay reporting are shining a light on inequality, so it has nowhere to hide.And that is why I set up the independent public inquiry into the tragedy at Grenfell Tower – to search for the truth, so nothing like it can ever happen again, and so the people who lost their lives that night are never forgotten.Because this country is a Union.Not just a family of four nations.But a union of people – all of us.Whatever our background, the colour of our skin, or who we love.We stand together.And together we have a great future.Our politics may be under strain, but there is so much that is good about this country. So much to be proud of. So much to be optimistic about.I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honour of my le to hold – the second female Prime Minister but certainly not the last.I do so with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.Mrs May had been warned thatshe didnt quit today, Sir Graham would start the process to force her out through a new no-confidence vote.And Cabinet ministers threatened to bring down the Governmentthe PM didnt abandon her attempts to force through the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Meanwhile the Tories face a near-total wipeout when the Euro election results are announced on Sunday night.This morning Mrs May faced one final blow to her authority as Helen Grant resigned as Tory party vice-chair, saying she wants to be involved in the leadership race by backing Dominic Raab.The Prime Minister wanted her legacy to be taking Britain out of the EU, before turning to the burning injustices of UK society.Instead she will remembered for her stubborn refusal to compromise and inability to unite her party.Her last-ditch bid to save the Brexit deal by offering MPs a vote on whether to hold a second referendum proved the last nail in her coffin, triggering a Cabinet rebellion with Andrea Leadsom resigning.Mrs Mays resignation will kickstart a furious race to replace her with Boris Johnson the favourite to take over.Mr Raab, Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove are also considered frontrunners - but as many as  Tory MPs could throw their hats in the ring.Today Mr Hunt confirmed hes planning to run for No while in a surprise move Sir Graham quit his  Committee position to launch his own run for the leadership.The leadership election is set to be hugely isive for the Tory party with the two dferent wings attacking each other over what should happen next with Brexit.The Lib Dems boss revealed hell hand over to a successor on July .He previously revealed he was planning to resign as party leader after the European Parliament elections.Today he formally kicked off a two-month leadership election with Jo Swinson and Ed Davey favourites to replace him.Sir Vince told members: Our campaigning over the last three years has kept the cause of remaining in the European Union alive, and I now believe we have a strong chance of stopping Brexit.He took over in  with the party at a low ebb having suffered two poor General Election results.But the Lib Dems have since risen in the polls, with a strong showing in the recent local elections.The Prime Minister will formally stand down as party leader on June  - but will stay in place while the new PM is being chosen, rather than handing over to an interim chief such as David Lidington.The leadership contest, overseen by party chairman Brandon Lewis, will take around six weeks.Any Tory MP can enter the race, and the list of contenders is then whittled down by the parliamentary party.MPs vote in multiple rounds, eliminating one candidate each time until just two are left.The partys , activists then choose behind the final shortlist of two, with the winner declared leader and Prime Minister.When Mrs May became leader, she didnt have to submit to a vote of members because Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race.So the last time activists have had a say on the leadership was , when David Cameron defeated David Davis.Today top Brexiteer Steve Baker insisted the next leader must be someone who is fully committed to our EU departure and ready to leave with No Deal.Jacob Rees-Mogg added: A new leader can get us out of the EU on October , that is in law.

The fact that elections guru Lynton Crosby – mastermind of the Tories’ unexpected win in  - is a big supporter speaks volumes about Boris’s credibility beneath the caricature.Above all, Boris needs to come up with a realistic plan for Brexit beyond just warm words.The key to that is the insertion of an exit clause into the vexed plan for an Irish backstop, which at present threatens to keep Britain in a permanent customs union.With such a clause, some of the concern about the Withdrawal Agreement would disappear, enabling it to pass the Commons.Boris would then emerge a hero, the man who not only promised Brexit but delivered it.Under the Tories’ eccentric system for the leadership contest, their MPs whittle down the candidates to a shortlist of two.The membership, which numbers just ,, then has a vote on the final pair.Through jealously or short-sightedness, the MPs might contrive to keep Boris off the shortlist, but that would be a farce, an establishment stitch-up of the kind that has wrecked Brexit.His name has to go forward for the membership ballot.As to the identity of the other candidate, there is a bewildering array of potential contenders.In fact, so many names have been mentioned and the party membership is so limited that there is a temptation to misquote Winston Churchill’s famous line about the Battle of Britain: “Never in the field of political conflict have so many offered so little to so few.” The main rivals to Boris for the Brexiteer crown are Dominic Raab, who is more of Thatcherite free-marketeer, and Michael Gove, whose intellect is matched by his ruthlessness, having pulled the rug under Boris dramatically during the last leadership battle.The Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who now presents himself as a born-again Brexiteer, is highly competent and shrewd, but lacks charisma.Even Graham Brady has resigned his post as Chairman of the infamous  committee so he can throw his hat into the ring.The Tories were the first British party to have a woman leader, and they might break new ground by having the first ethnic minority leader.The Home Secretary Sajid Javid could be this pioneer, especially since he has a compelling background as the son of a migrant bus driver.But, unfortunately, he is also a wooden performer and perhaps too much of a managerialist.Other possible ethnic minority candidates include James Cleverly, the Braintree MP who used to be a soldier and now serves as Brexit minister, and Priti Patel, the former International Aid Secretary and committed Leaver, though she is somewhat lacking in authority.The Chancellor Philip Hammond recently joked that he was the only member of the Conservative Parliamentary Party who is not standing.He has a point, for the list is ever expanding.There is now a whole phalanx of women such as the Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, the former TV presenter Esther McVey and the ex-Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who did her chances some good with her dramatic resignation from the Cabinet on Wednesday.Then there are the centrists like Rory Stewart and Matt Hancock, both of who present themselves as healers.But the sheer quantity of candidates cannot make up for the lack of heavyweight quality.

Her loss of the Tory majority robbed her of her authority, boxed her in on Brexit and discredited her domestic policy agenda.The failure of that campaign carries an important lesson for the Tories — they need a happy warrior.May looked deeply uncomfortable on the campaign trail, with the result that the more the public saw of her, the less they liked.This Tory need for a good campaigner is heightened by the fact that their next leader will have to fight on two fronts, against both Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage.On Brexit, May’s biggest problem was not knowing what she wanted. She triggered Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU that we had to request a humiliating delay to, without a clear idea of the kind of relationship she wanted — and how to get it.This meant that the UK wasted valuable negotiating time and ceded the initiative to the EU in the talks.The Tories need a leader with a plan. Whoever succeeds May will have to know what they want to get out of the EU and how they plan to get it. Given Brussels’ intransigence in these talks, they are also going to need Plans B, C and D.One of May’s other failings was that she didn’t understand one of the key purposes of preparations for No Deal.It wasn’t because you actually wanted — or thought you would end up with — No Deal. It was meant to secure a better deal.The leadership contest, overseen by party chairman Brandon Lewis, will take around six weeks.Any Tory MP can enter the race, and the list of contenders is then whittled down by the parliamentary party.MPs vote in multiple rounds, eliminating one candidate each time until just two are left.The partys , activists then choose behind the final shortlist of two, with the winner declared leader and Prime Minister.When Mrs May became leader, she didnt have to submit to a vote of members because Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race.So the last time activists have had a say on the leadership was , when David Cameron defeated David Davis.If the UK had been more visibly prepared to walk away, then the EU would have been more constructive in the negotiations.The new Prime Minister must spend the summer examining the state of our no-deal preparations.Absurdly, the Brexit delay has not been used as a chance to improve the UK’s no-deal planning but rather as an excuse to soft pedal. That must change.May’s other great failure has been failing to build a team or create a sense of collective endeavour.Both the disastrous  manesto and her Brexit plan were executed with far too little Cabinet involvement.She sent civil servants to do the very political job of negotiating. The result was a deal that was, unsurprisingly, politically tone deaf.May’s successor must appoint a Cabinet of all the Tory talents — and let them do their jobs.And we need a Brexit Secretary who actually negotiates with Brussels.The Tories have no perfect candidate for No . No one fully fulfils all of these requirements.But a Prime Minister who could deliver Brexit would give the Tories a fighting chance.THE way to think about the Tory leadership contest is that it is like a tournament with two sides of the draw, with each side sending one candidate into the final membership round.One side of the draw is for full-on Brexiteers.Here Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom, Steve Baker and Esther McVey will duke it out.The other side of the draw features the Cabinet candidates: Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart.Whoever comes out of the Brexit side of the draw will go into the final round as the strong favourite, given how Tory members just want the UK to get out of the EU.I understand that Boris Johnson has edged ahead of Dominic Raab on this side of the contest.But he will, in the words of one key MP, need to be “materially ahead” of Raab on the first round.Why  Because Raab is more likely to pick up support as more hardline Brexiteer candidates such asRaab’s pitch will be that the Conservative Party is toastit cannot deliver Brexit – and that he is the man to do that.He will argue that other candidates might be better known than him, but Boris’s celebrity won’t save the Toriesthey cannot get Brexit done.But one of Boris’s advantages over Raab is that he has more reach into the rest of the party.His campaign is beginning to pick up support from former Remainer ministers, who see the former London Mayor as the Tories’ best chance of seeing off the twin threats of Corbyn and Farage.At the same time, some on the left of the party have decided that stopping Raab – who they see as a down-the-line right-winger – is now their priority, rather than blocking Boris.ON the Cabinet side of the contest, the question is whether Michael Gove can overhaul Jeremy Hunt.The Foreign Secretary currently has more MPs backing him than anyone  in the Cabinet.But his campaign has had a bumpy few weeks, and some of his supporters are beginning to peel away.This, perhaps, explains why Hunt felt the need to confirm that he was standing just hours after Theresa May announced her resignation yesterday.Part of Hunt’s problem with MPs is that it is very hard to see him beating Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab when it comes to the party members.Their experience with Theresa May has made the membership very wary of former Remainers.GEORGE Osborne has finally had his revenge on Theresa May.He sent a text to a slew of Cabinet leadership hopefuls saying that a big prize awaited the minister who went and told May that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill had to be pulled.Several recipients of this text were amused when Sajid Javid, who was one of Osborne’s junior ministers at the Treasury, then went to demand that May shelve the second referendum part of the bill.SOME members of the  parliamentary intake are considering running for the leadership.They should hold their horses – the new leader will need more than four years of parliamentary experience.But whoever becomes the new PM needs to freshen up the Cabinet, to bring in this new talent.After nine years in government, there are too many administrators in Cabinet and not enough doers.It needs an injection of energy and fresh ideas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Parent firm Greybull Capital could be grilled in Parliament to explain how the company ended up on the brink. Unions, MPs and campaigners backed demands for the Commons ­Business Select Committee to open an inquiry into how the firm was put into receivership, jeopardising , jobs. Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner called Greybull “bandits” and “the ugly face of capitalism”. He added: “They should never have been able to get their hands on one of this nation’s strategic industries.” The ­investment outfit bought British Steel for a £ in .    Mr Turner added: “Unite is determined they will be exposed for what they are, which is why we are pressing for a parliamentary inquiry and an end to the short-term profiteering that wrecks lives and the economy.” Community steelworkers’ union operations director Alasdair ­McDiarmid said: “The events are still unclear... MPs have a duty to get the facts out in the open.” Among the jobs at risk are , at British Steel’s Scunthorpe plant and , in the supply chain, after Greybull failed to secure a £million bailout loan from the Government. The firm was placed in receivership on Wednesday.   British Steel, which has blamed Brexit uncertainty for its troubles, had already been handed a £million loan to pay an EU emissions bill.Business Select Committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves signalled this week that MPs could demand evidence from Greybull. She said the committee “will want to look at what triggered the collapse”. Shadow Steel Minister Gill Furniss said: “There are many questions surrounding the management and finance of the company over the last three years and the workers in Scunthorpe, Teesside and North ­Yorkshire deserve answers.”   Labour MP Anna Turley, who is secretary of Parliament’s cross-party group on steel, fuelled hopes bosses would be called.She said: “Whilst our priority is securing a future for British Steel, we need answers.” aposBosses will slip away into the sunsetaposComment by Steve Turner, United Union Assistant General SecretaryYou would have to have a heart of stone not to feel for British Steel workers right now.

The Labour leader demanded the new Prime Minister seek their own mandate when they enter Downing Street by triggering what would be the third such poll in four years.David Cameron won a slender Conservative majority in  but Mrs May squandered it  months later in her disastrous snap election. The next general election is not due until . Mr Corbyn welcomed Mrs May’s decision to quit and piled pressure on whoever replaces her to go to the public early. Writing in the Mirror he said: “Britain doesn’t need a new Tory PM, we need a general election to elect a Labour Government on the side of the many, not the few.  “When a UN report reveals there are  million people in Britain living in poverty, when , children are living in insecure accommodation, then I think we’ve got to see the need for a real change of direction.” Labour could call a no-confidence vote with the aim of forcing a general election, but it would not get backing from Tories now Mrs May has announced she is stepping down.A Survation poll on voting intension this week had Labour out in front on %, the Conservatives %, the Lib Dems on %, the Brexit Party on %, the Greens on %, UKIP on % and Change UK on %.Based on that, Labour could take anything from around  to about  seats in a general election, depending on how votes broke down.  Labour got % of the popular vote in  but just  seats, while the Tories won .% and  seats.    If Labour got a third of votes and Tory support collapsed, as the poll suggests, Labour would most likely be the biggest party in a hung Parliament. Should a new Tory PM decide to call a snap poll, it is likely they would secure the backing of the two-thirds of MPs required under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. However, one of the frontrunners to succeed Mrs May in No, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, last month warned it “would be absolutely catastrophic for us to face the people again in a general election”. Other Conservative leadership candidates are also likely to come under pressure to rule out triggering a fresh poll because a general election would hammer party finances, make new demands on loyal activists and risk opening the door to Labour. When Mrs May campaigned to become Tory leader in , she repeatedly ruled out a snap election – and then called one nine months after entering Downing Street. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon yesterday backed calls for the new Prime Minister to seek a mandate from the public.  She said: “[Mrs May’s] departure will not solve the Brexit mess that the Tories have created. Only putting the matter back to the people can do that. “Given current circumstances, it also feels deeply wrong for another Tory to be installed in No without a general election.”Labour could turn to her Scottish National Party as a coalition partner or a confidence-and-supply deala general election resulted in a hung parliament, but the SNP would want a second independence referendum, which Labour opposes in Scotland.Dr Simon Usherwood, a reader in politics at the University of Surrey, pointed out that while the Tories could change their leader, they were unable to change the numbers in Parliament without a general election. He said: “When you get a party changing leaders and Prime Minister, there’s always a lot of pressure to have a general election because that’s not who people voted for. “There maybe a feeling in No from the new team that they may want to get a more explicit mandate than just one from their party. Certainly it’s going to be in the air. “The advantage of an election isyou’re someone who feels confident you’ve made a good initial impression, you’re catching the opposition on the hop and you improve your situation. “One of the problems May faced was she lacked a majority for the Conservatives. If a new leader came in and thought they had a good chance of getting back to where they were before , that would count for a lot. “It would not only mean they wouldn’t have to worry about [obtaining backing from] the DUP, it would also mean they were a winner in the eyes of MPs who might then be more willing to go along with whatever plan the new PM came up with.”    Dr Usherwood said the earliest a snap poll could take place is October. “You want a bit of time to bed down and make an impression, and also get a feel about whether you’re likely to be successful,” he added. “If you’re not doing it quickly, you’re probably just saying, ‘Let’s just hang on for the rest of term we have got until ’.” The GMB union also demanded the next PM call a new ballot. General secretary Tim Roache said: “Working people are sick of the Tories focusing on who is going to take Theresa May’s job when thousands across the country are losing theirs. “We cannot let Britain’s workers, industries and communities become the casualties of the next round of Tory internal wars. “Let’s have a general election and let the people decide.”    Public wail of grief from this private womanSketch by Ben Glaze, Deputy Political EditorAt .am on Friday, Mrs May emerged from No  and strode confidently to the government-crested lectern. Armed police guarded both ends of the street as two union flags fluttered in the cloudless spring sky. And, in a bizarre coincidence, in the security hut, offi­cers were doing a whip-round for a leaving colleague. Back at the lectern the PM reeled off what she believes were her greatest successes. But she also conceded she had failed to deliver Brexit. Occasionally lting her glance to the barrage of lenses pointed at her face, her speech didn’t falter. ut as her seven-minute address neared its end and she spoke of being the second woman PM, her voice began to give as she blinked back tears. And as she expressed her gratitude at serving “the country I love”, her voice collapsed to a wail. It was a deeply uncomfortable public show of emotion from this most private of women. Husband Philip, hands behind back, must have been in knots watching his we implode. How dferent from  when he beamed as she told of her ambition to confront “burning injustices”. In a grotesque reminder of the issue that haunted and has now doomed her premiership, as the PM turned and walked back towards the black door a lone protester shouted: “Stop Brexit!” QAWhat happens now Theresa May will cease to be Tory leader on Friday, June , but she will stay on as caretaker PM while a new party boss is elected. Conservative MPs will st through candidates in a series of votes until only two remain. The final pair will take part in hustings across the country, which will be open to non-members. But only Conservative members, numbering about ,, will have a say. Once a winner is announced, Mrs May will visit the Queen at Buckingham Palace, formally resign as PM and recommend the monarch appoints the victor. Moments later, her successor will become our new PM.What does this mean for Brexit The UK is due to leave the EU on October  with or without a deal. Bookies’ favourite Boris Johnson yesterday signalled his support for quitting without a pact. But MPs would surely try to find a way to stop a no-deal departure. A new PM could ask Brussels to look again at its Withdrawal Agreement offer. The EU has stressed it will not reopen the deal, but parliamentary deadlock, political chaos and a change in No throws everything up in the air.A further Brexit extension beyond Halloween could be requested. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker leaves office in November, followed by European Council President Donald Tusk in December, potentially paving the way for a new deal to be negotiated – one which might get through the Commons. Will there be a second referendum Campaigners believe the ongoing turmoil boosts their cause for another vote. They claim once all other plans fail, there will be nowhere  to turn and a fresh poll will be the last option. But there is no majority in Parliament for a second referendum.Will there be a general election  Jeremy Corbyn wants one, but the polls are so volatile –– especially given the Brexit Party’s sudden rise – it is impossible to predict who would win.A new PM will study polls in minute detail to see whether it is worth them risking an election to secure their own mandate. The next No incumbent will be under huge pressure to boost their authority with an election. But all Tories will be wary of going to the country after Theresa May squandered the party’s majority with her disastrous snap poll in  after being unable to resist the lure of a -point poll lead.

More than  MPs have already mulled chucking their hats in the ring to replace her. And four have confirmed they plan to stand in the contest. Boris Johnson revealed he would be standing during a QA at the British Insurer’s Conference in Manchester. Askedhe would stand in the race, he said: “of course”. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey was one of the first out of the gate, confirming her intention to stand in early May. She said: “I have always said quite clearlyI got enough support from my colleagues, yes I would. “Now people have come forward and I have got that support, so I will be going forward.” International Development Secretary Rory Stewart confirmed he planned to run in the contest earlier the same week, saying he could “bring the country together.” And within hours of Mrs May stepping down, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told his local newspaper he would be running in the election. Unlike Mrs Mayaposs election in , where Tory members never voted, this race promises to be the most bruising in years. And just like her election, it will have profound consequences for Brexit - with a hard-right, Hard Leaver likely to take the reins. Possible candidates have been shamelessly jostling for position, holding secretive dinners, parading their families and doing puffy newspaper interviews in a bid to scoop up support. Some have even declared openly, with Boris Johnson booming: Iaposm going to go for it!  Under the rules of a Tory leadership race, candidates bidding for the crown must be nominated by two or more fellow Tory MPs. A series of knockout ballots is then held among MPs to whittle down the wide field of candidates to just two.  Those two preferred candidates go to a run-off of the wider Conservative Party, with its , members eligible to vote. The candidate who wins the most votes becomes the leader.

The Old Etonian was one of the key players in the  Leave campaign after a last-minute decision to back Brexit. He resigned from the Cabinet in  in protest at Mayaposs plan. He was tipped as a successor to David Cameron but ruled himself out after Michael Gove stabbed him in the back with a last-minute bid for the top job. Since then heaposs lost weight and had a haircut in what many argued was a pre-leadership bid upgrade. Sure enough he confirmed by telling a business conference: Iaposm going to go for it! Selecting the former mayor of London for eight years would enrage Tory Remainers, who believe he is in this game only for himself and his ego. He became notorious for his attention-grabbing offensive comments, when he called black people piccaninnies, said Barack Obama was part-Kenyan and compared the EU to Adolf Hitler. Heaposs also criticised for vast sums of money he rakes in alongside being an MP for speeches and a £,-a-yearcolumn - which was rapped for inaccuracy by the press regulator. Meanwhile, heaposs been rapped for showing a lack of respect to Parliament by repeatedly breaking Commons rules. Supporters say that since splitting with his long-suffering we Marina Wheeler and shacking up with ex-Tory head of press Carrie Symonds, heaposs mended his ways and become more serious. But scores of Tory MPs would vote for Anyone But Boris and a Scottish operation to stop him was nicknamed Operation Arse. Dominic Raab ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING: .   During his four-month stint as Brexit Secretary, ultra-hard Leaver Dominic Raab suggested he would use leaving the EU to slash business taxes. Now heaposs running for leader heaposs hinted p could be slashed off income tax - cutting billions from the public purse. And that wasnapost all that would anger left-wingers. The -year-old sparked fury in  by saying most food bank users are not languishing in poverty. He claimed: The typical user... is someone who has a cash flow problem. When a disability activist told him people are dying under Tory austerity, he described her calls for cash as a childish wish list. And he put out a pamphlet in  that suggested exempting small firms from minimum wage laws for workers under . Mr Raab positioned himself early on for the leadership, setting out his plans to tackle kne crime with “robust policing” and community work. He also paraded in his home in a cringeworthy interview with his we. And he attempted to outflank hostile competition by addressing claims he used a gagging order, to silence a former colleague who accused him of bullying. Mr Raab told The Sunday Times the claims, which date back to  before he was an MP, were completely ”. Michael Gove ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Environment Secretary had a bruising experience in the last Tory leadership race stabbing Boris in the back before finishing third. And he kept his powder dry in the days immediately following Theresa Mayaposs announcement she would quit. But behind the scenes his allies, including Treasury minister Mel Stride, have been approaching MPs in the most unlikely positions to seethey will join his slate. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror Mr Gove was one of the most likely to be elected. Despite infuriating teachers when he was Education Secretary, and stabbing Boris Johnson in the back for leadership in , the -year-old is seen as a competent media performer and has won plaudits as a campaigner for environmental issues. He has already paraded with his Scottish parents as part of the proxy leadership contest in the party. He was a prominent face in the Brexit campaign, but he isnapost wildly trusted by other figures on the Conservativesapos eurosceptic wing.    Jeremy Hunt ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was a prominent Remainer in the  referendum. And now heaposs even more prominent - loudly positioning himself as a possible leadership contender. Heaposs taken select journalists on a high-profile trip to Africa and appeared in cringeworthily staged photos with his we. Later he made the leadership bid even more obvious by pointedly calling for more defence spending - a sure-fire hit with the Tory grassroots. As Health Secretary, Mr Hunt, , fought a long battle with the medical profession over a new contract for doctorsapos working conditions. The -year-old became Foreign Secretary in July following the resignation of Boris Johnson. He chose not to run in the  leadership contest and instead gave his full support to Mrs May, saying it was not the right time to put his hat in the ring. Mr Hunt made a public sht towards Euroscepticism after the referendum.    Andrea Leadsom ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, grammar-school educated former bank executive is about as true blue Tory as you can get. She survived to the final two of the  Tory leadership race, pitching herself as the Hard Brexit, blue alternative to Theresa May with a cringeworthy march in Westminster. But she infamously pulled out after making controversial remarks about motherhood and trying to deny them. She has said she is seriously considering running for the leadership again. And she played a crucial part in forcing Theresa Mayaposs resignation announcement, after resigning from the PMaposs cabinet and blasting her Brexit plan just hours before the EU elections.    Penny Mordaunt ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    Recently promoted to Defence Secretary, Penny Mordaunt is a -year-old Royal Navy reservist whoaposs only been an MP since  - but has a rich slew of headlines to her name. From bellyflopping on TV ing show Splash! to slashing billions off benefits and lying about Brexit, sheaposs often been famous - and only sometimes for the right reasons. The daughter of a paratrooper and special needs teacher, who has a twin brother, the Portsmouth North MP went to her local comprehensive. She worked in a factory and as a magicianaposs assistant to save up for Reading University, which she was the first member of her family to go to. The PR supremo was director of communications for the National Lottery, head of campaigns for Diabetes UK, head of foreign press for George W Bush’s  and  election campaigns and chief of staff for former MP David Willetts.    Rory Stewart ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Hong Kong-born son of a diplomat, an Old Etonian, once admitted his career gives the appearance he was a spy. The -year-old delivered his own child after a career as a diplomat in the Foreign Office. He was elected MP for Penrith and the Border in  and joined the government in . The International Development Secretary wasted absolutely no time after being promoted to the Cabinet in May . He announced his pitch to be PM within hours. Mr Stewart said: I think itaposs important at this time when the Prime Ministeraposs said sheaposs going to step down to have a voice thataposs arguing for being radical. But, radical in the centre of British politics, not radical on the extreme right of British politics. Yet his approach - blindly following the PMaposs Brexit deal and saying it might even be worth splitting the party for - has made him wildly unpopular among Tory Brexiteers.    Sajid Javid  ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Home Secretary has spent a few months warming up for a leadership bid. It’s widely expected the next Tory leader will be a Brexiteer. Meaning Mr Javid, , who backed Reman but now supports Leave, would have a real fight on his hands to win round Tory members. He took over at the Home Office after Amber Rudd was forced to quit over the Windrush scandal - and has picked public fights with Mrs May on key issues like immigration and police funding. But his star has fallen over chaotic handling of migrants crossing the Channel. He was accused of stoking tensions by declaring a national emergency to deal with a few hundred migrant crossings over a period of months. Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani bus driver, would be the first non-white Prime Minister. Matt Hancock ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING: .     The ambitious -year-old entered politics as George Osborneaposs adviser and was in the inner circle of the famously cliquey ex-Chancellor. The parkour- and karaoke-loving Conservative entered Parliament in , Government in  and joined the DCMS in July  after Mrs May took over as Prime Minister. He was swtly promoted to Culture Secretary and then Health Secretary. But he came under fire for accepting thousands from the boss of a think tank which wants to scrap the NHS. Within days of the PMaposs announcement, he somehow found his way onto the Good Morning Britain sofa, where he said of leadership: I think you don’t rule out these things.” Then, all but confirming he would run, he posed with a horse. Graham Brady ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, made a Sir in , holds Theresa Mayaposs fate in his hands as chairman of the  Committee. The august body runs leadership challenges in the Conservative Party and could change the rules to force Mrs May out. Heaposs currently its premier diplomat in the Tory war, but could reportedly sacrice his immunity to run for the top job himself. The grammar-school-educated MP for Altrincham and Sale West is a former PR man who turned MP in  and was the chief aide to former Tory leader Michael Howard. James Cleverly ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old Brexiteer is a tub-thumping Tory whoaposs not afraid to go into battle on social media. The MP for Braintree has repeatedly got into spats with Labour since taking his job as Tory Vice Chair. Heaposs a boisterous character at social events and in the bars of Parliament, making up for a lack of Westminster experiencewith fierce public loyalty. Esther McVey  ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:   The hardline Brexiteer confirmed she will be running for the Tory leadership with a pledge to slash £billion from foreign aid, and spend it on schools and the police. The former welfare-slasher and rank outsider said: Iaposve always said quite clearlyI got enough support from colleagues then yes I would, and now people have come forward and I have got that support. But former GMTV presenter Ms McVey became notorious among benefit claimants after working as a Minister and later Secretary of State in the Department for Work and Pensions. Her blunt style drew floods of criticism even when she managed to secure limited extra money for cash-starved Universal Credit, and U-turned on a benefit cut for the disabled.  Over the years, she made a number of controversial comments which turned her into a lightning rod for anger about benefits. She was ousted from her Wirral West seat in  after a sustained campaign against her, but ed in George Osborneaposs ultra-safe Tatton seat in . She made clear that under her leadership Britain would leave the EU on October  - deal or no deal. Amber Rudd ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Amber Rudd was previously seen as a favourite to replace Mrs May. But as the party has drted to the right the moderate Remainer Ms Rudd had fallen out of favour. She was forced to quit as Home Secretary during the Windrush scandal. But after eurosceptic Esther McVey quit the government, remain-supporting Ms Rudd, , ed to government as Work and Pensions Secretary. She has a tiny majority in her seat of Hastings and Rye, which would make her vulnerable to any co-ordinated insurgency from local Labour backers. The Work and Pensions Secretary gave a wide-ranging speech on  May that called for a st Century approach to work in what many will see as a pitch for the Tory leadership. She said I hope a softening of benefit sanctions show her credentials as a so-called aposOne Nationapos Tory. And she admitted sanctions may have damaged the Tory brand, saying: If there has been damage I hope we can reverse that.  She dodged questions on whether she would throw her hat in the ring for the Tory leadership, saying: “I’m committed to the DWP”.    Liz Truss ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Chief Secretary of the Treasury is about as right wing as they come when it comes to economics. The -year-old also loves to tell a joke and hasnapost really hidden her ambition to one day hold the top job. She even posed in Westminster for a photo shoot and an interview with the Sunday Times, calling for £bn to be spent on tax cuts. And she appeared in a series of hair-raising photos with wide-bottomed trousers before giving a speech that ranged far beyond her brief. But disappointing performances in high profile jobs like her time a Justice Secretary has left some MPs questioningshe has what it takes for the top job. She voted to Remain in the referendum - but has since said she would change her mind and became a born-again Brexiteer. Tom Tugendhat ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The privately-educated ex-Army officer only became an MP in  but that hasnapost stopped talk about the leadership. The -year-old has risen to prominence with stinging criticisms of the government from his  as chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. He could be a figure to unite Remainers and softer Leavers in his warring party - especially the younger flock.

David Gauke  ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The pro-Remain Justice Secretary is highly unlikely to be putting his hat in the ring. But there is some suggested he could team up with fellow Remainer Amber Rudd to run on a joint ticket. He also gave a wide-ranging speech on Thursday  May straying beyond the confines of his brief. Mr Gauke took a swipe at populists like Boris Johnson saying: Populism would undermine the United Kingdom.  In the context of the United Kingdom, right-wing populism means English nationalism. The biggest problem with populist policies is that too often, they’re just plain wrong.

David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher before her all suffered the same fate, as the Tory party’s obsession with Brussels picked them off one by one. Mr Cameron, at least, told his party to “stop banging on about Europe”, but then unleashed a referendum he was sure his own side would win. Her successor will inherit the whole unresolved Brexit mess.    Much as Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, or whoever ends up as PM, may like to think they have the negotiating skills May lacked, they don’t. Skip forward a few months and they will realise that all the constraints faced by Mrs May exist for them too. But expectations, and frustrations, will have grown.

Barbara Winton hit out at the Prime Minister for speaking about Sir Nicholas Winton, who organised the aposKindertransportapos for  mostly Jewish children during the Second World War. It comes after Labour peer Alf Dubs, himself a kindertransport refugee, also took issue with the reference. In her speech, Mrs May said: For many years the great humanitarian Sir Nicholas Winton – who saved the lives of hundreds of children by arranging their evacuation from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia through the Kindertransport – was my constituent in Maidenhead. At another time of political controversy, a few years before his death, he took me to one side at a local event and gave me a piece of advice. He said, ‘Never forget that compromise is not a dirty word. Le depends on compromise.’ He was right.    But Barbara Winton wrote in The Times tonight: Sadly, such admiration has not led to following in his footsteps in relation to today’s child refugees. Like so many others who believe the UK should be welcoming more vulnerable refugee children, I increasingly despair at the situation facing child refugees in Europe today.Just a few weeks ago I travelled to Calais and Dunkirk to meet people surviving in makesht camps in the woods and tents on the sides of motorways. Organisations estimate there are hundreds of unaccompanied minors in Northern France, some as young as ten. Lord Dubs, who has long campaigned for Britain to accept more refugee children from camps in Europe, tweeted: Nicky Winton did not compromise. He was resolute in his determination to save refugee children like me. He added: I hope that before she steps down Theresa May will honour Nickyaposs memory by welcoming more unaccompanied refugee children from France, Italy and Greece.  In , ministers accepted the aposDubs amendmentapos after a long campaign by Labour peer Lord Dubs. His law had called for , unaccompanied child refugees to be accepted into the country. The government caved in - on one condition. They said the , figure couldnapost be set in stone, and must be flexible. So it was with outrage that the government under Theresa May announced theyaposd accept just  kids. Ministers insisted they chose that figure because it was the limit of what councils could accommodate. Yet in a chaotic development, councils then came forward to announce they had extra room - so the number was upped to . Ministers admitted thereaposd been an administrative error. Just last week, Lord Dubs visited refugee camps in Calais to meet children fleeing from war.    “These are the forgotten children on Britain’s doorstep,” he told the Sunday Mirror. “We’ve ­abandoned them. I’m so angry about it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sir philip green plans party","story":"NewsSir Philip Green plans party on superyacht as Arcadia prepares to axe  jobsEXCLUSIVE: Topshop boss, who has avoided the office for nearly a year, throws lavish bash as  of his stores get ready to closeShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video philip-green-tells-reporter-things-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWith hundreds of jobs in his­ ­collapsing empire threatened, Topshop boss Philip Green is said to be planning a party on his yacht near Monaco. News of the bash to celebrate to­­­morrow’s Grand Prix emerged after parent company Arcadia admitted the tycoon had not been near its London HQ “for nearly a year”. The bizarre claim came following new allegations Green, , had slap­­ped women workers’ bottoms. Earlier this week Arcadia announ­­ced plans to close  Burton, Dor­­othy Perkins and Topshop stores, putting  jobs under threat. Rents at  other stores will be cut and all  Topman and Top­­shop outlets in the US are set to close. The pensions regulator does not believe the move will “ade­­quately protect” workers pen­­sions and ­yes­­terday Labour MP Frank Field called on Sir Philip to use his own cash to pay them out.Mr Field, who heads the Work and Pension Committee, told The Mirror: “Clearly he hasn’t got time for his business but he has time for a lavish party on a lavish yacht.    “He ought to make a lavish contribution to make up the mega pension deficit.” Shopworkers union Usdaw called Green’s skiving “unacceptable”. National Officer Dave Gill said: “It is absolutely shocking that the chairman of a struggling business has apparently not been in the office for a year.    “We’ve all seen the pictures of Philip Green on his yachts and we think he should come ashore and focus on keeping the business afloat.” A small army of staff have reportedly spent the week prepping Green’s -metre yacht Lionheart for ­tomorrow’s party.    Workers were seen polishing bannisters as food and drink was loaded in San Remo but little is known about what is planned. However, previous parties held by tycoon have not been low key. For his th in  Green had a £million four-day bash in Mexico where guests danced on the beach to performances by Stevie Wonder and Robbie Williams. The latest claims of sexual ­mis­­conduct came in the House of Lords on Thurs­­day.  Speaking under the protection of parliamentary privilege, Lord Peter Hain said one of Green’s alleged victims had told him: “He was touching and repeatedly slapping women staff’s ­bottoms, grabbing thighs and touching legs.” Green, who has always denied the allegations, said making the comments while Arcadia struggled was “beyond irresponsible”. Arcadia said the firm was thor­­­oughly investigating all grievances.    Beast has deserted his crumbling lairComment by Graham HiscottPhilip Green once used his London office as a lair to lord it over the family fashion empire. Underlings and suppliers were summoned, with many enduring a tongue lashing. No more. With his company at risk of crumbling and yet more lurid allegations against him, Green is breaking the habit of a letime and keeping a low profile. Visits to the UK are rare and those to his HQ clearly rarer. Tory wannabe leader Rory Stewart has said he’d take Green’s knighthood away “tomorrow”. But it’s two and a half years since MPs voted that he didn’t deserve the gong. Yet still, despite pressure from MP Frank Field, the Commons committee that could recommend it has remained shamefully silent.

Stubborn to the last, she only broke down at the end of her speech in which she vowed to quit as Tory leader on June  to make way for a new PM by the end of July. Watched by devoted husband Philip and loyal senior aides, she said: “I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honour of my le to hold. “The second female Prime Minister, but certainly not the last. “I do so with no ill will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.” She will stand down as Tory leader on June  after a state visit by US president Donald Trump.    She will then remain as caretaker PM until her successor is elected by the end of July, when she will visit the Queen at Buckingham Palace and formally resign. Power-hungry Tory leadership rivals immediately began jostling to take over yesterday, led by frontrunner Boris Johnson.The former Foreign Secretary prompted accusations of hypocrisy after urging colleagues to “come together” to deliver Brexit – after spending months undermining Mrs May’s own strategy.He unleashed further fury by stressing he would back a damaging No Deal departure from the EU to ensure the UK leaves by the end of October.    Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, the favourite among MPs, waited barely three hours before announcing his own run for the top job.Jeremy Corbyn told the Mirror that whoever takes over must hold an election to “let the people decide our country’s future”.Mrs May’s announcement came after a final showdown at No  with Tory backbench chief Sir Graham Brady, who was prepared to trigger another no-confidence vote in her leadershipshe refused to resign. Her fate was sealed after her new Brexit plans earlier this week infuriated Tory backbenchers and many of her own Cabinet. Ahead of her statement, she rang her constituency chairman in Maidenhead, Berks, to tell him she was leaving No – but that she would not be standing down as an MP. Instead, she will decide what to do at the time of the next general election.    Mrs May stepped out through the black front door of No just after am yesterday to admit her Brexit plans had finally hit the wall. She wore a Peter Blake skirt suit in deep orange, a colour that represents change. Around her neck was a chunky silver-and-Perspex necklace, another of her trademark don’t-mess-with-me accessories, the size of which has increased with the scale of the mess she has faced in recent years. She said: “It is and will always remain a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit. “I have done everything I can to convince MPs to back that deal. Sadly, I have not been able to do so. I tried three times. “I believe it was right to persevere, even where the odds against success seemed high.  “But it is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new Prime Minister to lead that effort.” Mrs May quoted her late constituent Sir Nicholas Winton, the Kindertransport hero who rescued hundreds of children from the Nazis, urging Tory MPs to compromise over Brexit. She recalled: “He said, ‘Never forget that compromise is not a dirty word. Le depends on compromise.’ He was right’.” But she prompted a furious response from his daughter, Barbara Winton, who said: “Sadly, such admiration has not led to following in his footsteps in relation to today’s child refugees.” Mrs May’s claim that the inquiry into the Grenfell fire tragedy, in which  people died, was a proud legacy of her time in office was branded “disgraceful” by the Fire Brigades Union. Union chief Matt Wrack said: “Many of the underlying issues at Grenfell were due to unsafe conditions that had been allowed to fester under Tory governments and a council for which Theresa May bears ultimate responsibility.”  Her defeated, emotion-racked statement was in stark contrast to her first speech outside No when she became PM on July ,  and optimistically pledged to tackle the “burning injustices” she identied. But having failed to break the Commons Brexit deadlock, she finally agreed to leave. After a sobbing Mrs May walked back through the door of No  she was met with a round of applause by Downing Street staff. Tory party chiefs announced the leadership contest would begin on Monday June  to allow MPs time to whittle down the crowded field of up to  candidates by the end of the month. The heavily eurosceptic Tory membership would pick their leader after hustings around the country.  In previous contests this has been from the last two, but sources suggested the final shortlist could be longer to make sure Mr Johnson gets through. Party HQ wants a new leader to take over before the Commons rises for the summer, expected to be around July , to give time to bed down. Home Secretary Sajd Javid, Environment secretary Michael Gove and hardline Brexiteer Dominic Raab are all expected to stand, while even Sir Graham, who dealt the fatal blow to Mrs May’s leadership, stood down from his party role to consider standing. Mr Hunt said: “Now we need to put aide Brexit dferences and unite the party and country”. But former Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson deepened the Tory schism on Europe by ruling out another extension of Brexit beyond Octoberpicked for the top job.  It would give him a hard deadline of just three months to renegotiate a deal - or face the economic and political turmoil of leaving without one. At an economic conference in Switzerland, where he banned his speech being recorded, he said: “We will leave the EU on October , deal or no deal... “The way to get a good deal is to prepare for a no deal. To get things done you need to be prepared to walk away.” EU chiefs poured immediate scorn on Mr Johnson’s plans to try to reopen negotiations. “We would be really stupidwe had refused the reasonable negotiators and now suddenly reopen the door to Boris,” said one Brussels insider. Another denied that leaving No Deal on the table would force them to reopen talks. “No Deal has never impressed the EU. It is one of the [hard Brexiteer] myths to think it gives the UK leverage,” they said. The move accelerated the ‘Stop Boris’ campaign of anxious One Nation Tories who fear Mr Johnson could unleash chaos with his Brexit plans and drag the party further to the right. Defence minister Tobias Ellwood said: “If the Brexit experience to date has taught us anything, it’s to avoid making promises and drawing red lines you may later regret or cannot honour.”  Former Tory MP Nick Boles said: “I have many friends in the Tory Party but I’m afraid the party has nothing to offer the country now.  “A new leader will not end the ision, break the grip of ideology or be more in touch with people’s everyday concerns. The country needs something new.” aposSave your tears for the real victims of Theresaaposs MayhemaposComment by Kevin MaguireDon’t cry for cruel Theresa when it’s her victims who deserve our tears. May, like Margaret Thatcher, weeps only for herself. The cracking voice was the sound of self-pity over the collapse of her disastrous Premiership. Mendacious May’s record shows little affection for the millions whose lives she made worse. So let’s grieve not for an incompetent Tory PM but for the record number of hungry families forced to rely on foodbacks to eat.The struggling pushed below the breadline by Universal Credit .The tens of thousands of extra children abandoned in poverty, their lives blighted from birth. The pupils in schools and colleges begging parents to buy toilet rolls and clean classrooms. The sick who are hurting on longer NHS waiting lists or marooned in corridors on hospital trolleys. The burgled or kned denied justice after she sacked , police officers. The nurses, teachers, firefighters, council workers and civil servants whose incomes she squeezed. And all the workers whose wages are down more than a tenner on a decade ago.

She leaves after three years in No with the unwelcome distinction of having achieved almost nothing of any substance. Mrs May came to office with noble intentions, promising a fairer country and to end the burning injustices. In what became a pattern with her premiership, the words were never matched by deeds. She bequeaths a dismal domestic legacy of more than four million children in poverty, a record number of people using foodbanks and crumbling public services. There was no attempt to grapple with two of the biggest and most pressing challenges of our time, climate change and social care.    Judged on this alone, Mrs May would have ranked as one of the least accomplished PMs. But it is her failure on Brexit which will cement her place as one of the worst premiers. She ran for PM fully knowing delivering on the referendum would dominate her term. This was an act of hubris by someone whose temperament, management style and skill set have proven woefully insufficient. Her time in office will be remembered for its record number of ministerial resignations and the worst Commons defeat inflicted on a PM. Some will have sympathy for a PM who wept as she announced her departure. They should remember Mrs May shed no tears for the victims of the Windrush deportation scandal nor for those who have been left starving because of Universal Credit. While public services struggle and thousands of steelworkers face an uncertain future, the Tories will spend the next two months indulging in yet another leadership contest. There is no reason to believe the next leader will be any more successful than the last. Who takes over the reins of power should not be in the hands of Conservative MPs and a few thousands party members. If the next leader wants a mandate to govern they should call a general election.

The choir sang at the top of their lungs, as a junior version of the Spice Girls danced and a zorbing bunny rolled by. A tiny superhero on a racing car trolley zoomed across the stage, and an even smaller version of Dec popped up from a wheelie bin.    Their joyous audition has racked up . million views on YouTube. How much did it all cost  “Nothing,” shrugs head teacher Mr McPartlin. He’s called Dave, but it seems wrong to call him anything other than Mr McPartlin just like his pupils do. “The kids glued, stapled and painted all the costumes with a lot of help from teachers and parents. “Tesco lent us a trolley, although Miss Smith lost her pound deposit. Even the coach company that took us to Manchester gave mates’ rates.” The -year-old head insists the BGT success is down to the kids. But he’s the man who put laughter on the curriculum at a school, seven miles north of Blackpool where % of children receive free school meals. “We are proudly working class,” says Mr McPartlin, originally from Hartlepool. “Just like my parents taught me, you can achieve anything you set your mind to.”    Flakefleet’s motto is “Dare to dream” and Mr McPartlin wants them to dream big. Last year, a plan to ­celebrate the royal wedding by singing songs in a church grew arms and legs. He says: “We ended up with a horse-drawn carriage carrying our own version of Harry and Meghan through streets adorned with bunting. “Then one boy said we should’ve had a helicopter, so we held a raffle and hired one. We want to teach our kids anything’s possible.” Seven-year-old Scott Wood said he wanted to be a photographer, so they lent him cameras and helped him land his first paid gig as a wedding photographer.

Walking from one side of the building, he is bombarded by class-loads of children who run up for a group hug. “I fell in love with this school the moment I first came three years ago,” he says. “It hit me like a double decker bus. Everyone was so welcoming, smiley, special.” No one’s giving anything away about their next performance. A girl in a reception class is slathering a balloon with papier-mâché but hides the prop when we approach.  Birthday parties have been missed, parents have spent evenings bent over sewing machines, and one family ­rearranged their holiday.

Mrs Wild says: “The first time we asked who wanted to do solos, the kids squirmed and looked to their feet. This time they all stepped forward. “Sometimes, when we’ve listened to them, we’ve thought ‘where did that voice come from ’. “There’s one boy who makes me cry every time he sings. I’m filling up thinking about it.” In the gym hall, tape maps the size of the stage at London’s Hammersmith Apollo, where the live semi-final will take place.

Crisps contain an omega- fat called linoleic acid that was previously thought to have health benefits such as lowering blood cholesterol. But researchers found that feeding rats with three times the recommended daily intake of linoleic acid decreased hormones that regulate the growth and development of their unborn babies. It also affected their liverand increased proteins that cause contractions in the uterus, according to the findings published in The Journal of Physiology.    Up until recently, people were encouraged to consume omega- fats because it was thought to help to reduce blood cholesterol. And vegetable oil, which also contains linoleic acid, was marketed as a healthy and cheaper alternative to using animal fats in cooking. Study senior author Dr Deanne Skelly, of Grfith University, said: “It is important for pregnant women to consider their diet, and our research is yet another example that potentially consuming too much of a certain type of nutrient can have a negative impact on the growing baby.” The research team at Grfith University in Queensland, Australia, fed rats for  weeks on a diet with high linoelic acid and mated them.    They then investigated the effects of the diet on their pregnancy and the development of their offspring. The team also found rat mothers who ate a high linoleic acid diet had a reduced number of male babies. It is not known whether the same effects would be seen in humans or what amounts of linoleic acid would be harmful.

The smitten golfing legend proudly paraded Lindsay De Marco, , at last weekend’s PGA Championship in New York and is believed to be unaware of her past. And this week the -year-old, who won six major trophies in his glittering career, flew her to the UK – posting snaps of them hugging on a walk in the grounds of Windsor Castle. When approached, she denied having worked as a dancer, saying “Oh my gosh” several times before then saying “No”. But one ex-husband – married to her twice – told how she performed as Toni in the mid-s at his adult club in Florida.    And he claimed she kept trading up hubbies because she was “consumed” with climbing the social ladder. Randy Heine said: “Lindsay had incredible sex appeal. It oozed from every pore. She can seduce any man and clearly she has got Sir Nick smitten. “When Lindsay was dancing, she had men wrapped around her finger. Sports stars, celebrities, politicians, lawyers, doctors – no one was immune from her charm. “How do I know  It was my club she was dancing in. I taught her everything she knew but when we started dating, that was it.    “You don’t want your girlfriend jiggling her boobs in another man’s face. She left her first husband to be with me. I was number two and three. “She’s married three more times since then, each time climbing the social ladder. It consumed her. “While Sir Nick was picking up six Majors, Lindsay was picking up six husbands.” Randy, , said after dancing briefly, Lindsay was taken off the rota to serve drinks at his Astra bar in Pinellas Park.  He then made her the manager at his tobacco firm, The Tobacco Emporium. But in  the business was one of  stores in central Florida raided by federal agents as part of a three-year undercover probe. It led to Lindsay and Randy being charged with drug offences, including possession of marijuana and selling drug paraphernalia.    In October , Lindsay pleaded no contest at state level – which accepts conviction but does not admit guilt – and got a  fine and six months’ probation. Two years later, in a Florida federal court, she brokered a deal and entered a guilty plea to one charge of “use of interstate conveyance to ship drug paraphernalia”. Lindsay – who has used  dferent names and lived at  addresses in  cities – got six months of house ­detention and two years of probation. Randy claims they had faced up to  years in prison and a , fine after initially being charged with  counts. By the time of her sentencing, Lindsay had wed her third man, Colonel ­Nicholas De Marco, who was described in court as a “career officer” in the legal wing of the US Air Force.  The charges against her were said to have put the military federal agent in a “sensitive position” as he was previously an FBI liaison. Although she and De Marco orced, she has reverted to using his surname while at golfing events. The fourth man she married was Thomas Bracken and she then wed multi-millionaire Scott Sangalli. She and Sangalli were close to failed Presidential candidate Mitt Romney and Sangalli used his wealth to support the Republican Party while indulging Lindsay’s love of politics. Seven years ago, after previously running for office herself, she won the title of Mrs Conservative US . When approached, Lindsay spoke of how she was Nick’s girlfriend but could not recallshe had been married to five dferent men – one of them twice. She also refused to confirmshe had drug convictions but denied the topless dancing claims.  Lindsay and Nick, who live in Ponte Vedra, Florida, have set up several joint social media accounts detailing their globetrotting and gushing about their le together. It is the latest in a string of relationships for Nick. His first marriage, to Melanie Rockall, ended after four and a half years when it emerged he had checked into a hotel with another woman claiming to be “Mrs Faldo”. That mistress was his then manager’s secretary, Gill Bennett. He married her in  and they had three children. But it ended in an estimated £.million orce when Nick got together with -year-old University of Arizona golf student Brenna Cepelak in . In turn, Brenna was furious when he traded her in three years later for Swiss PR consultant Valerie Bercher – taking a nine iron to his Porsche and causing £, of damage. “This one is going to last,” Nick said of his marriage to Bercher. But they orced in May . Since then, he has been linked to Turkish-born Hulya Parta but began dating Lindsay last year. Sources say they are inseparable and spent Christmas at the golfer’s UK home, overlooking Windsor Castle, after he took her to Lapland.  Randy said: “Sir Nick will tick every box for Lindsay. He is worth an estimated £million, is hugely famous and what’s more is a knight of the realm. “She’ll love all the pomp and circumstance and revel in the thought she is Lady Faldo. “There can’t be many rungs left on her social ladder. Who’s next  Prince Charles  Good luck to Sir Nick.” We yesterday traced a former manager of Astra who confirmed Lindsay was a topless dancer. Harold Pike, , said: “Lindsay danced for about three months before her and Randy got together then moved behind the bar. “The girls there would wear bikinis and took off their tops. They’d have to wear pasties [small patches] to cover their nipples.” Despite repeated attempts to contact Nick, representatives Octagon refused to comment.

Grandfather of nine Michael Green became stuck behind a table after falling at his home in Leicester - leaving him struggling to breathe and unable to call for help with his phone just out of reach. His family claim they were told Michael had died as a result of a pre-existing medical condition, COPD, but when one of his daughteraposs grew suspicious over the cause of death, they requested the transcript of his  call - and were horried with what they heard. The tragic transcripts of those phone calls reveal that as Michael lay dying,  operators told him he might have to wait four hours for help - and by the time an ambulance arrived  minutes after his call, he was unconscious, and pronounced dead shortly after.    Now, his devastated daughters have released transcripts of his tragic last call in a bid to discover the truth of what happened to their father after not believing the events told to them by East Midlands Ambulance service. Daughter Julie Green, , said: The police knocked the door at around midnight to tell me my father was dead. They took me to my dadaposs house, and he was lying dead on the floor. We only found out about him being trapped and choked by a table when requesting the telephone call recording after the funeral. I think he must have tried to reach for his phone and the table just fell onto him. I think he sort of fell down and got caught on his neck, he had been trapped for five hours. They never did an inquest into his death, they told me that it was down to his pre-existing condition but when we went to see him on the night my daughteraposs noticed a big bruise on his neck. Obviously, when we heard that, we remembered the bruise on his neck.  Until receiving the recording, the family had no idea of the distress Michael was in when he called for an ambulance. They saw a lump on his head and neck bruising and now theyaposve complained. The first call made at .pm, Michael can be heard breathing heavily down the phone whilst talking to the operator. Michael said: Iaposm stuck on a chair I canapost get up...I have pain all over my stomach...I have pancreatitis and C.O.P.D... The operator explains that they wonapost be able to get help to Michael for another four hours. Michael says: Oh dear, my neckaposs going dead, Iaposm stuck on the chair. I need somebody quick I have been stuck for five hours. The operator reples: Help has been arranged but we prioritise our ambulances to attend the most le-threatening emergencies... we aim to be with you within the next four hours unless we have an available ambulance sooner. After calming Michael, the operator puts the phone down, a second call is made from Michael to East Midlands ambulance service at .pm. Michael said: hello, I canapost hear you, they reckon the ambulance is going to come in four hours but Iaposm nearly collapsing now, Iaposm in that much pain. I canapost hear you pal...I just want someone to pick me up again, the table is sticking in me that much Iaposm passing out now.    I just want somebody to lt me up, Iaposve got stuck in the chair, Iaposve had a bad day today. Take the pain away...I just want somebody to move me, I canapost ... feel like Iaposm going numb. The operator asks Michaelhe can move the table away from his neck. Michael said: Iaposve been trying for hours now, I canapost work it, itaposs digging in me. The operator says he must hang up and take another call, the ambulance arrived at .pm, an hour and  minutes after the first emergency call. Paramedics found Mr Green at his Cashmore View home, unresponsive, and although CPR was performed and a mechanical chest compression device was used, he was pronounced dead at .pm. Julie said: My dad has been cremated so an inquest canapost happen. The ambulance report said that he was sat, and stuck on a table, naturally I thought he was just sat at a table and couldnapost get up.  Thinking about all of that, I think he died because of the restriction of his air ways, which could have been stoppedthe operators he spoke to had listened to his call properly and asked the right questions. Once you know he has COPD, can hear him breathlessly talking and has a table pressing against his neck stopping him from breathing - which they knew, when do the right questions get asked. Theyaposre not apologising to us theyaposre not stating their mistake. You could see how hard he grabbed the table you could see his handprints where he had been trying to get himself up. Heaposs a strong character, he wouldnapost even call unless he knew he was in trouble. We just want to know the truth so we can move on.  Ben Holdaway, Director of Operations at East Midlands Ambulance Service said: Representatives from our service have met with the family to personally offer sincere condolences for their sad loss, and to respond to their concerns. I am sorry that we were not able to send an ambulance sooner when Mr Green called for help in September , and I appreciate the distress this has caused his family. A detailed reply to their concerns has been provided in writing and through conversations with them, and our dialogue continues. Whilst it is of no comfort to Mr Greenaposs family, signicant investment by our commissioners announced in May last year has resulted in EMAS being able to address a fundamental gap in resourcesneeded to respond to emergency and urgent calls. The funding allowed the biggest frontline recruitment programme in EMASapos history with over  new, additional colleagues being recruited and trained to join our frontline from the start of this year. Added together with further efficiencies at EMAS and our continued recruitment drive, patient services are improving. We are getting to patients faster, despite an increase in activity and on-going challenges outside of our control that act on our ability to respond eg hospital handover delays.

I didn’t want anyone to ask me questions about it. I didn’t want to talk about it. “I just didn’t want to know about it. Everything out there wasn’t pleasant information for me to read.” I would say my, my biggest insecurity with Ehlers-Danlos would have been my skin. From being out in public and wearing tank tops and dresses and shorts. As I got older it, it just kind of started to show more and more. Following a dficult breakup at the age of , Sara decided she needed to change how she saw herself.In  she submitted a photo to Tumblr page aposLove Your Linesapos, which celebrates womenaposs stretch marks , scars and other imperfections.The response was overwhelming, with more than , people liking her submission.    One of Sara’s biggest supporters and the reason she got into modelling is her girlfriend, Briana Berglund, who is now Sara’s personal photographer. Briana said: “I’m so proud she’s come so far over the last couple of years. It’s just crazy how much she has really come out of her shell and she is just so amazing I’m so proud of her.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

It is obvious to everyone that the pier not being open is a resource wasted.#Inveraray Pier has been in existence since . Comprising an older stone-built section and later timber structure, it was once a thriving hub for Inveraray#s herring fleet and a popular destination for passenger steamers. It was used by everything from pleasure craft to puffers, with the military also making good use of it over the years.In more recent times it has fallen into disrepair and was closed off to public access in the last decade.#When we heard it was for sale we decided to make a bid,# continued Mr Byrne.#It would have been a shame to see it fall into the hands of someone who would want to use it just as a private pier. It#s about securing its future.#The Byrne family intends to re-open the pier for public use # but Mr Byrne is keen to dampen speculation about the potential future uses for the structure.Before anything  happens, the condition of the stone and wooden sections must be assessed, and reports have been commissioned from engineers and conservation architects.#I don#t want to raise expectation unnecessarily, but the most likely scenario is that we look to re-open the stone pier first of all,# explained Mr Byrne.Repairs would be needed to the stone structure and ironwork. New handrails and safety equipment would be needed along with lighting and basic security measures such as CCTV.Beyond that, the future of the wooden pier looks less certain.refurbishment is not an option, alternatives might include floating pontoons, while the potential for dredging around the pier and harbour might be considered.Through an agent, The Argyll Partnership, the Byrne family has contacted the Clyde Marine Planning Partnership with a view to having Inveraray included in the fledgling Clyde Regional Marine Plan, stressing that the pier #represents a great opportunity to contribute to the economic, social and environmental needs of the Clyde Marine Region#.And the new owners have said that the community council, Inspire Inveraray and others from the area will be fully involved as the redevelopment takes shape. The plans are also said to have the backing of the Duke of Argyll.Mr Byrne concluded: #Hopefully local people will want to help and come forward with ideas.#I don#t want to raise hopes at this early stage, but I hope that buying the pier is a good thing to do.#"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 24 5 19","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe numbers drawn for the Kilmory Camanachd Club lottery draw on Monday May  were ,  and .

prevent staff or ex-staff from publicising certain information.That information can range from commercially sensitive details, such as innovations or company finances, to anything likely to damage an

national headlines.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoNon-disclosure agreementsare included in ious types of agreement entered into by the council to resolve a situation.ldquoNDAs are

even-handed approach to non disclosure agreements.He said: ldquoSecrecy by a public authority is sometimes necessary, but any overuse does not reflect well on a public authority which should be committed to openness and transparency. ldquoI read of growing concern about the use of non disclosure agreements across a range of public bodies with Westminster MPrsquos, for example, calling for

asked questions about and they were going to get in touch with Memsafe to come back and give us an update on them.ldquoAnybody with any concerns, and have before and after pictures of the headstones that were tested and made safe, should let us know.\"What we felt as councillors is that given that we had to do the test, given that we had to do the test in a certain way, it had been done in the best possible way that was available to the council given the legislation that was governing us.Community Councillor Peter Maudsley askedthe contractor was paid per headstone taken down.He said: ldquoOne of the things that interested me is how the contract with the contractor arranged.\"Are they paid by the number of stones that they have to take action with  Becausethat is the case, then there will be a tendency to hit more headstones than they might otherwise have done.Councillor Haslam said this was one of the questions asked by elected members to council officers.She explained: ldquoIt is based on the number that they test, so there is no bonus for them with the number they take down.Members of the community council still feel there is unhappiness within the town over the current state of the cemetery and are considering putting in an application to the Common Good Fund for memorial restorations.Chairman Les Turnbull said: ldquoIrsquom wonderingthere is anything as a community council we can do to try and help improve the look of the cemetery, and perhaps affect some sort of repair on some of the stones that have been taken down.Councillor Haslam replied: ldquoWe were informed by officers thatthe community council provide funds to enable the headstones to be fixed then the community council would therefore accept liability in the future should those headstones fall onto somebody.Peebles Community Trust is now seeking the views of locals regarding remedial work in the cemetery.Community councillor and Chairman of the PCT, Lawrie Hayworth added: ldquoAs part of that clearly we would need to look at the legislative and insurance implications in discussion with our councillors.Councillor Stuart Bell said: ldquoI think itrsquos important that we take proper procedures in regard to rectying the dficulties and particularly the anxieties in relationship to the headstone testing programme thatrsquos been on-going.ldquoOne of the things that was brought to our attention when we went around the older part of the cemetery is the number of gravestones that have been set against the wall, because this process of testing headstones and putting to one side those that are in danger of falling over has been going on for many years."},{"url":null,"title":"dunaverty golfers april medal","story":"None more so than Campbell MacBrayne.

We also have the folk that are working hard to make our town nicer place to live like the In Bloom group, the volunteers who attend the bi-weekly beach cleans and the group that is working to protecting our library by volunteering to make it a more attractive and interesting place to go.ldquoThese people are the reasons why Cockenzie and Port Seton in my books is one of the best places in Scotland.The iLiveHere website contains hundreds of cutting reviews of villages, towns and cities across the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"josh-taylor-wins-world-title-with-victory-over-ivan-baranchyk","story":"The Prestonpans boxer convincingly defeated dangerous Belarussian fighter Ivan Baranchyk to take his IBF super lightweight belt and in the process become the first Scottish boxing world champion since Ricky Burns lost his belt at the same weight to Julius Indongo in .Taylor had been favourite going into the World Boxing Super Series semi-final fight but the Beast Baranchyk, renowned for his powerful punching, was always likely to present a stf challenge.Unsurprisingly, the defending champion entered the area to a chorus of boos, while Taylor by contrast received a rapturous reception.After a cagey opening round, the fight quickly settled into the pattern it would follow for most of the night: Baranchyk throwing flurries of powerful punches but failing to properly connect, while Taylor was clinically precise and accurate with his own shots.Taylor was, for the most part, well on top, though Baranchyk shook him briefly in the fth round, including opening a cut above Taylorrsquos left eye.However, there only looked like being one winner when in the sixth round Taylor dropped Baranchyk to the canvas with a crushing blow to head. Impressively, the Belarus fighter rose instantly, but was back on the floor by the roundrsquos end, saved from what looked like certain defeat by the bell.There was no escape for Baranchyk in round seven, however, Taylor hunting him down and connecting with shot after shot.To his credit, Baranchyk soaked up the considerable punishment he was receiving to hold his own in rounds eight and nine, before being rocked again in round  but just surviving to the bell.Knowing now he was well behind on points and that only a knockout would save him, Baranchyk emptied the tank in the final two rounds. Rather than trying to evade him, Taylor threw plenty of punches of his own, leaving the crowd gasping with concern on more than one occasion, but the Prestonpans ace stayed on his feet and knew he had done enough to win the world title he so craved.There was no tense wait for the result to be announced ndash there was no doubt at all who the winner was going to be.And as the words ldquoand the newhellip were spoken, the rest of Taylorrsquos victory announcement was drowned out by the delighted bellows of the Hydro crowd as they acclaimed the newest boxing world champion.ldquoI took more risks than I should have, I could have made it a lot easier for myself, Taylor admitted afterwards.But the new champ ndash sporting a t-shirt emblazoned with those words he had long been desperate to hear, ldquoand the new ndash added: ldquoIrsquom absolutely over the moon, before leading the crowd in singing Flower of Scotland.When the dust settles from this truly special evening for Taylor and East Lothian, he will cast his mind forward to what is still to come, the World Boxing Super Series Super Lightweight final.His opponent there, New Orleans native Regis Prograis, is highly regarded and it looks sure to be a close contest.But after handling an opponent of Baranchykrsquos calibre as capably as he did, Taylor will fear no one and be confident of adding Prograisrsquo WBA world championship belt to the IBF one that is now his own, as well as claiming the Muhammad Ali Trophy for the World Boxing Super Series champion.For now, however, itrsquos time for Taylor to celebrate ndash hersquos certainly earned it!"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-groups-celebrate-share-of-10000-funding","story":"Now in its third year, CALArsquos Community Bursary, supported by the Courier,

But hes still a bit bewildered by it all.\"Im completely surprised about it,\" he declares.\"For lack of any better phrase, I dont have a f***ing clue whats going on!\"There is much to talk to him about, from his rise to fame and his accolades, which include a Brit Critics Choice Award nomination, a place on BBC Musics Sound of  list and his seven weeks at number one for his single Someone You Loved.There is also his penchant for discussing his toilet habits and mocking himself on Instagram.Capaldi is almost as famous for his social media shenanigans as he is for his heavenly voice and charismatic, emotional ballads, but he says the two seemingly at-odds facets of his persona were not planned to be that way.\"I dont really pay much mind to what I put on social media, as you can probably f***ing tell,\" he jokes.\"I just act like a tit and film it for a laugh, but the music side of things I put thought into.\"Maybe people like me because of a combination of the two, but I never set out to be anything in particular.

I dont understand how this is a thing!\"Capaldi has . million Instagram followers and , on Twitter, and they have become accustomed to his hilarious self-filmed videos in which he mocks himself, often in a pair of bizarre sunglasses or a not-so-fetching shell suit.Having been named \"the funniest musician on social media\" by a number of outlets, one of his most popular moments saw him complaining about blocking his toilet in a fancy American hotel, but discovering the absence of a plunger or toilet brush.The sunglasses in particular are a common trope of Capaldis. So much so, his fans are now gting him with more shades than he can deal with.\"Whenever we go on tour Ive got a suitcase full of ridiculous sunglasses,\" he says.\"But Im getting into it.

It was reported to be the first time anybody has planned a tour in such large venues before their debut album had even been released.\"I mean, I was quite content when we were doing our tour at the end of last year,\" Capaldi says.\"We were doing gigs in , capacity rooms and I was like, This is incredible, this is as big as Im ever going to get and thats absolutely fine.\"Ive always been quite laid-back. When I first got my manager, I said all I want to do is play King Tuts, which is a place in Glasgow for  people - thats a goal.\"And then I did it, and now its gone beyond anything that I could have ever hoped for.\"He laughs: \"So all of this is a complete f***ing surprise.\"He says he was \"shitting it\" when he announced the arena tour weeks before his debut album, Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent, was scheduled to drop.\"Ive got a lot of faith in all the people around me that are actual professionals, as opposed to me whos a bit of an impostor, but the people around me were saying, Look, this is the right move.\"And I was like, OK cool, Ill give it a go. So we did it, and now its sold out.\"Even now Im still nervous. It already went from small pubs to a few thousand capacity rooms, very quickly, and now its going from that to , people.\"Its a long way from half a letime ago for Capaldi who, at the age of , started performing in pubs.\"I started playing the guitar when I was nine, because my older brother, who is six years older than me, he was doing it,\" he explains.\"I started writing songs from that age too, and when I turned  I wanted to play gigs. My older brother, he was in a band, and he got me into pubs.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

In summer children run as wild as rabbits. The Knapps is a place of a searing tranquillity only broken occasionally when a free-range dog barks at the sight of fish splash.The Knapps is the place to go to escape, to walk the two miles circumference and with each step cast off the problems of the week gone by. Itrsquos a place for lovers and children to hold hands, for bored couples to try and remember why they donrsquot hold hands anymore.Now, I donrsquot walk, in general, but I can delight in the Knapps because it is watched over by the biggest, grandest house in the village, Wimborne,  years old.From the Knapps I can look over and imagine its one-time owner, the indefatigable Bill Mills skiing down the hill, getting grumpy at Guy Fawkesrsquo when the rockets would frighten his Great Danes, or simply standing in his garden, in awe at ldquoThe most terric view imaginable.

The two-mile stretch leading up to the car park at Arnish is the famous Calumrsquos Road, built in the s and s, using only pick-axe, wheelbarrow and shovel by a single man.Sweeping through tortuous hills and boggy moorland, it was his attempt, executed over  years, by Calum Macleod to create a literal leline for his remote community in the north of the island and an easier connection for his daughter going to school on Skye. The community at Arnish, however, still dwindled and he and his we were its last inhabitants.But less well-known is Calumrsquos Path, also known as Raasay Post Road, built by Calum and his brother, under contract from the local council during three winters from  to , for pound each per season. This rocky path, etched into a steep hillside that sweeps down to the sea, was, effectively, his training ground for the road.A visit is possible,the tide times are right ndash check beforehand and add extra time for the walk ndash across a slippery, seaweed-covered causeway to the island of Fladda. A circular route brings the hiker, sweeping round past a lochan and taking in views of Skye, to the former township of Torran.Pit stop: For some years there has been only one bar and cafeon the island and that resides in the magnicent, airy Raasay House, an outdoor centre looking out over Skye.

From here follow the river along another flat stretch until you see a sign pointing the way to Mugdock Country Park.The path can be steep in places towards the end, but comfort yourself that it will all be downhill on your . The popularity of the route with walkers and dog owners alike means the place can become Sauchiehall Street-busy at peak holiday times, so go early morning or evening to avoid the crowds.Pit stop: At Mugdock you can dine in Caulders Garden centre, or have something lighter at the Stables Tea Room or Charliersquos coffee shop and bar. Water for dogs is always available in the courtyard. There is lots to do at Mugdock, from hiring a bike to exploring the many trails and the playgrounds, meaning you can easily make a day of it, finishing with an evening meal in Milngavie.ALISON ROWATNorth Glen Sannox to Lochranza coastal walkTime: Four hoursWhat makes it special: A tranquil shore-side ramble offering glorious views and an array of natural wonders.THEArran Coastal Way encompasses the island but this beautul stretch has the advantage of being entirely off-road and mostly on the level, with good paths and just a few rocky places requiring a little more care.Take the bus to the North Glen Sannox picnic area then strike off along the signposted path, beginning in partially cleared woodland thats garlanded with wild honeysuckle in summer.Out on the open shore, there is so much to see: endless ocean views, flowers at your feet and abundant wildle, from dolphins and deer to the eagles soaring over the hills above.Youll pass the ruins of th-century salt-pans and houses, now poignantly mellowed by age and vegetation. Beachcombers can scour the pebbled shore for shells, sea-glass and the occasional bit of washed up nautical paraphernalia.The path can be muddy after rain and youll need to tread carefully at An Scriodan rocks , but even this once challenging section has been signicantly improved.Approaching Lochranza, youll pass Huttons Unconformity: peculiar, layered rocks cited as evidence of th-century geologist James Huttons revolutionary theories about the earths formation.Pit stop: Roughly halfway round is the abandoned Laggan Cottage, now a walkers bothy but a nice place to picnic while imagining what it would be like to live here, with only passing seals for neighbours. Once in Lochranza, you can fill up at the distillery or hotel while awaiting yourbus.SUSAN FLOCKHARTHolyrood Park, EdinburghTime: Four hours to all dayWhat makes it special: A verdant city centre walk affording spectacular views ndash for the energetic. A loch at either end, each with a convenient car park, and another in the middle, a palace and a parliament nearby, crowned with rugged clfs ... whats not to like MOSTpeople only explore the centre of Holyrood Park, but its a shame to miss out Duddingston Loch at its western extremity, a nature reserve noted for wildfowl, herons and the Skating Minister.Park in the car park here, and after a short uphill walk along Queens Drive, you are rewarded with a pleasant downhill stroll where you will pass families, dog walkers and students messing about with frisbees, kites and their ilk.A short detour will take you to the Scottish Parliament, Dynamic Earth and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Head back to the park and amble on to explore St Anthonys Chapel before resting at St Margarets Loch, populated by ducks and swans as unheeding of the traffic as a -year-old plugged into headphones.For theleg, follow the path in a clockwise direction, and take the time to climb Arthurs Seat for breathtaking views of the capital. Clamber back down andto the car park, taking in the man-made Dunsapie Loch on the way.Pit stop: At the Duddingston end, try the venerable Sheep Heid Inn, which claims to trace its roots back to .DREW ALLANWhitelee Windfarm, Eaglesham MoorsTime: Itrsquos vast but you can choose to walk for hours or simply take a -minute stroll from the visitor centre around the nearest turbinesWhat makes it special  Peaceful and safe walk in a dramatic, turbine-filled landscape.THE windfarm has been part of our lives since our boys were wee. Wersquod shrug off the sleep deprivation, wrap them up in layers of fleece, bundle them into pushchairs and head off along the tracks for bracing fresh air.Itrsquos accessible and fairly flat, but you should stick to the trails ndash surrounding areas of blanket bog are wet and soft with hidden ditches and drainage channels. The views from the viewpoint and the cafe are stunning.Now our boys are older, we take part in sponsored welly walks for the school, or pack up the bikes and enjoy traffic-free cycling. Going in at the Ardochrig end gives a dferent perspective, more of a forest walk, but often maintenance work is carried out here so check in advance and always be vigilant: it is Europersquos largest onshore windfarm, with  turbines, after all.Itrsquos also just a great place for solace, space and room to breathe.Pit stop: The cafe in the visitor centre is good for coffee and cake, or a soup and sandwich.ANN FOTHERINGHAMBangour Village Hospital grounds, West LothianTime: Between  minutes and two hours to all dayWhat makes it special  Striking architecture and a fascinating history.ITis  years since the final patients departed and Bangour Village Hospital closed its doors for good. When the idea to build it was conceived in , this former psychiatric facility was viewed as revolutionary.I grew up with Bangour as a neighbour. My late father worked as a psychiatric nurse here.

Very soon Bangour, as it has stood for more than a century, will be no more.Located less than five minutes west from J of the M, there is free parking at the main gate. The grounds are popular with dog walkers, runners, cyclists and amateur photographers alike. Warning: stick to the paths and donrsquot try to enter any of the buildings as many are unsafe.The first patients arrived in  and it was officially opened two years later. In marked contrast to the Victorian era when mental illness was poorly understood, Bangour was set up on a village system of patient care, encouraging self-sufficiency and with few physical restrictions. Facilities once included a farm, bakery, workshops, recreation hall, church, library, school and shop.Wandering round the criss-crossing network of paths, many of these buildings still exist in ying states of decay but as time passes, nature is steadily reclaiming large swathes. There is woodland with mature trees home to wildle such as rabbits and deer. It is a beautul and tranquil spot.Pit stop: Dobbies Garden Centre is around a mile east along the A. Irsquod also recommend the excellent Williamsons Garden Centre and Coffee Shop, just a minute further along the road, for homemade soup, sandwiches and cakes.SUSAN SWARBRICKBack Walk, StirlingTime: - minutesWhat makes it special: The views and the history and the workout for your legs.WHO remembers Henry Campbell-Bannerman now  The Liberal Prime Ministerwon a landslide in the  general election, passed the Trade Disputes Act which protected unions from being sued for going on strike, introduced free school meals and generally was a good egg. These dayshe gets a mention at all itrsquos as a pointless answer on Pointless.Still,you are in Stirling, where he served as MP for four decades, you can doff your cap to his statue on Corn Exchange Road. The statue also marks the start of Stirlingrsquos Back Walk, a path that takes you travelling back in time.It is also, it should be noted, depending on the route you take, a bit steep, although the lower path starts with a sedate stroll below the city walls, past the Albert Halls , past the bowling green and the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum .And then you start to climb. And climb. And climb. Itrsquos a short but steep hike, zigzagging up the side of the volcanic plug towards Stirling Castle.The walk takes you past the Stirling Highland Hotel , the th-century Cowanersquos Hospital , and,you step away from the path, the Church of the Holy Rude. Oh yes, and then therersquos Stirling Castle, which, is, admittedly, a bit hard to miss.The path itself loops around the Old Town cemetery, which offers views down on the Kingrsquos Knot . Walk up the steps to the castle esplanade where you can turn one way and see the Campsies and the Trossachs. Turn the other for the Ochils.From Ballengeich Road, cross over to the Gowan Hill where executions were carried out in the medieval era. The beheading stone is still on display. From here you can look out over Stirling Bridge and the Forth valley. If you look down and to your right you can probably see where I used to live. There is no plaque to mark those years , but therersquos still time I suppose. A statue is probably a little too much to expect.Pit stop: After all that yoursquore due a caffeine break. Walk down from the castle to Friar Street where Unorthodox Roasters has taken over from the late, lamented Sable  Flea.TEDDY JAMIESONTOMORROW: READ PART "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9893343.jpg?type=article-full","title":"classroom-of-children-to-enter-poverty-in-scotland-each-day-for-five-years-without-urgent-action","story":"The independent think-tank Institute for Public Policy Research Scotland, with the social policy charity Joseph Rowntree Foundationhas called on the Scottish Government to implement its \"income supplement\" much sooner than a proposed date of  to help curb the trend.Without urgent action to bring in the supplement, the Scottish Government would fail to meet its targets for reducing child poverty in Scotland - and instead levels would rise dramatically, they say.Scottish Government poverty statistics in April show that child poverty has crept up, with an estimated , children now living in poverty in Scotland - representing just under a quarter of all children.The calculation is based on the number of children living in households where income after housing costs is below % of the UK median ndash known as ldquorelative poverty.The Scottish Government which has a stated commitment to eradicating child poverty has four targets for cutting child poverty in Scotland by .

But given increasing child poverty rates we want to see urgent action to make a start earlier than planned.:Far more spending needed to cut Scots child povertyldquoWe believe the Scottish Government can and should bring forward plans for an income supplement before the end of this parliament, and to consider an interim payment before this.A Scottish Government said: ldquoOur first Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan, published last year, outlines the actions to be taken between - ndash including working towards the development of a new income supplement.

Whatever the reason, he made his base at York before launching not one but two sustained military campaigns into ancient Scotland, giving orders to ldquokill everyone, even the unborn in the womb.Dr Simon Elliott, a trustee of the Council of British Archaeology, documented the campaigns in his last book ldquoSeptimius Severus in Scotland: the Northern Campaigns of the First Hammer of the Scots and for the first time laid out the route taken by the legions.Next year he plans to trace the path from York to Hadrianrsquos Wall and up to the Gask Ridge in Perthshire, where the Romans built a string of forts to keep a watch on the Highlands.The tour will also visit Inveresk, East Lothian, where the legions halted and visit the remains of a supply depot on the River Tay at Crammond.VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead has described it as a ldquowelcome addition to Scotlandrsquos rich and erse mix of historical tours.Dr Elliot said: ldquoI got the idea for the tour when I was actually doing the research for the Severus in Scotland book, visiting places like York, South Shields, Corbridge, Newstead, Inveresk, Cramond, Edinburgh, Carpow, the Gask Ridge and Ardoch.ldquoThe story of his two huge campaigns north of the Border is astonishing, more Game of Thrones than Game of Thrones really, and linking these and other locations together for a week-longguide lectured tour is a brilliant way of telling it.ldquoPeople get to see the actual sites featured in the campaign, can understand how the geography and geology of the campaign theatre impacted upon it, and get a real sense of what Severus was trying to achieve, for good or ill.Severus, with his sons Geta and Caracalla, marched their army up the Roman road, which stretched to what is nowadays the Borders and drove the tribes back, before splitting the legions in two. At some point, probably at South Queensferry, a bridge of  boats was built to allow the Caracalla to cross northwards, chasing the fleeing tribes who fought a guerilla campaign without resorting to a pitched battle they could not win.The emperor then attacked from the south, subduing the local populace. He ed to York, but a second uprising forced him to send his men north again, prompting him to issue an order to his son to kill every man woman and child they encountered.The resulting slaughter is believed to have led to a depopulation of the lowlands for a century, but Severus knew little of it.Already an old man when he launched the campaign, he died in  AD and his sons immediately left for Rome, leaving the Caledonian campaign as a footnote in history.Dr Elliot said: ldquoMy objective is that those participating in the tour get the chance to learn every detail available about the Severan campaigns in Scotland, and the emperor himself, first hand as it were given the locations visited and my own expertise through researching and writing the book.ldquoThe research into Severus naturally flowed from my PhD research which partly focused on the Classis Britannica Roman Navy in Britain.ldquoFrom there I wrote my first book, on the Classis Britannica itself called Sea Eagles of Empire.ldquoWhile researching that I came across one of the campaigns it had participated in, the Severan attempts to conquer Scotland.ldquoThe more I researched that the more I became hooked on these astonishing, audacious campaigns and decided totell the story in book form for the first time."},{"url":null,"title":"more-tories-set-to-enter-leadership-contest-as-race-for-new-pm-begins","story":"Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd ruled herself out of the contest, but speculation mounted that Health Secretary Matt Hancock would announce on Saturday that he was in the running.More than a dozen Tories are understood to be considering a bid, with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt indicating he will be in the race.The new Tory leader looks set to take over as prime minister at the end of July after Theresa May finally laid out a timetable for her exit from Downing Street.Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson, who has emerged as the bookiesrsquo favourite, stressed he would be prepared to back a no-deal departure to ensure the UK leaves the EU on October .The timetable for the contest will see nominations close in the week of June , with MPs involved in a series of votes to whittle down what is set to be a crowded field to a final two contenders.Tory party members will then decide who wins the run-off.Ms Rudd told the Daily : ldquoI am conscious the Conservative Party wants someone who they believe is very enthusiastic about Brexit.ldquoThere are all sorts of plans I would like to have when we do leave the European Union but I donrsquot think it is my time at the moment.The Cabinet minister made it clear she would not have a problem working with Mr Johnson in Government again.However, Prisons Minister Robert Buckland expressed concern about a no-deal exit from the EU.He told BBCrsquos Newsnight: ldquoMy message to candidates is to think very carefully before hurtling away to a position of lsquono dealrsquo and not just the self-interest of a leadership competition.ldquoFor them to box themselves into their red lines is not the wisest way to go into this leadership election.Tory MP George Hollingbery said Mrs May was disappointed in herself.He told the BBC: ldquoHer sense of duty drives her from her very core.ldquoFor her she is so disappointed in herself I believe, because she has not delivered what she ought to have delivered for the benefit of the country and she feels she should have done better.

Maybe, at work, we use tools, from pens to spanners, that incur carbon emissions in their production.As I say, Irsquom not doubting it. Just finding it hard to grasp.

Irsquom afraidyou think the capitalists are going to pay us the full wage for a nine-hour week, then yoursquove more irrational optimism than a new Scotland football manager.As for productivity, itrsquos recommended that robots could be deployed but, after the experience of having one as prime ministerfor the last three years , the jury is out on the efficacy of that.The point you have to keep in front of you is that, according to those who know, the planet is in danger of going down the Suwanneewe donrsquot take radical action. Environmentalists say the need is urgent, but I suspect wersquod have to go about this gradually, one day at a time, and thatrsquos before we start thinking about the implications for income.So, the challenge for the future might be for those of working age, as well as others, to use their spare time creatively and make it just as enjoyable as work.

It has witnessed the UK becoming an international laughing stock, a Brexit-fuelled resurgence in iniduals and groups on the far right and an increase in social inequality.However, rather than putting their faith in a prospective leader of gravitas and sound principles who will command national respect, the Conservatives appear to be resigned to the fact that Boris Johnson will be the new Prime MinisterAn astonishing and shameless volte-face has been witnessed by Messrs Gove and Mundell as well as by Ruth Davidson, in the last few days, ample evidence that they are politicians of few scruples or genuine principles. Mr Johnson has been lambasted, correctly, for his buffoonery, casual racism and total contempt for Scotland and its people. Nevertheless, these three Scottish politicians, blinded by personal professional survival and ambition, have abandoned their previous implacable opposition to him as the political wind changes course.It seems that they will bow to the common populism within their own party and therefore to Mr Johnson and his acolytes, to allow themselves to endure.I suspect that this treachery in enabling this sawdust Trump to climb to the pinnacle of power in Britain is only the first scene in the Conservativesrsquo own re-enactment of the Night of the Long Knives.

She was a reactionary Home Secretary and an incompetent Prime Minister. However, she is likely to be replaced by an even worse person: Boris Johnson, who is a charlatan. If the people of Scotland donrsquot choose independence now then they never will.Hugh Kerr,Edinburgh EH.THERESA May was hit by irreconcilable tectonic plates south of the Border and has finally succumbed.Yet she could have earlier reached out across all parties and governments, in particular in Scotland and Wales,to create an agreed broad approach to Brexit. But she did not. She tried bungs to the DUP, she dismissed the inputs from Edinburgh and Cardf, barely entered into discussion with Nicola Sturgeon and became more haughty and stubborn as time went on issuing her red lines as political writ.The British manest destiny myth as interpreted by all and sundry down south finally did it. Confused by notions of entitlement and power, the society in her English heartland, filtered through the duopoly and exaggerated by the ERG in particular and the Tory grandees in general, the Brexit juggernaut finally flattened her premiership as it will subsequently inflict politically and constitutionally a denouement on the UK.As a person Mrs May might be glad to go, but as a former and failed PM she will have a great deal to reflect on. She has experienced what the country, and Scotland in particular, has experienced from her very party, a ruthless vindictive organisation. It rebounded on her very self. She was ironically a product and a victim of that very party.John Edgar, Kilmaurs.THE world has just witnessed the biggest exercise in democracy with the General Election in India, where more than  million people took part.Almost two years ago, more than . million citizens, in one of the worldrsquos oldest democracies, elected Theresa May to be their Prime Minister and the leader of their country. But it only took a small number of predominantly politicians from the ERG and the  Committee to throw a collective temper tantrum, thereby choosing to ignore the will of the people by bullying Mrs. May out of office, simply because they could not get their own way in Parliament. This, coincidentally, is the same ldquowill of the people that this same group of politicians say must not be ignored over Brexit.If we are truly a democratic nation, why are there no failsafe protocols to prevent this from happening  How can Parliament hold its head high and take the moral high ground on any issues when it so brazenly cheats its citizens, by ignoring the basic fundamentals of democracy  We chastise and punish children for much less serious behaviour.Unlike the UK, the PM of Indiawill remain in that position for five years.Francis Deigman, Erskine.THE likely coronation of Boris as the new Tory Party leader is a wonderful example of the extraordinary poor quality of many MPs in the st century.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeedecided on Thursday, May  to introduce alternative arrangements to push up recycling rates and reduce materials sent to landfill. They approved an option to use households’ existing bins in a three-weekly collection cycle while officers continue to work to explore funding opportunities for further changes. One bin and a food waste caddy will continue to be collected every week meaning week one will start with general waste binsand food waste collected, week two will see Recycling binand food waste collected, and week three will also be a recycling bin and food waste collection.The materials that can be recycled on the kerbside remain the same - the only dference is that the blue-lidded recycling bin is emptied more often.The new service will be piloted in some areas in  and rolled out to the rest of Aberdeenshire in .Households will be contacted in advance by post.As over % of the waste produced in Aberdeenshire is recyclable using the existing recycling services, this change should allow an increased recycling rate, while work continues to seek other ways to push that up even further using kerbside services. ISC chair Peter Argyle said: “Clearly the decision by Zero Waste Scotland not to consider our funding bid has had a negative effect on our well-developed plans to push up Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate and send less recyclable materials to landfill.“This was not our first choice as a solution, but this is the position we find ourselves in and we feel that this option makes the most of a dficult situation and will help push up recycling rates. “At present, we see this as an interim measure, while we work to deliver a permanent scheme which provides a service for our residents which enables them to recycle as many materials as possible.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Meldrum Library is located at the Academy campus\"  Help Doctor Who by visiting library viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"“One of the key things we continue to try to impress is that we want residents to simply think for a second about how they dispose of the waste they generate, then use the services we provide as best they can.” Vice chair John Cox said: “It can come as no surprise to anyone that councils are trying their hardest to offer services which push up recycling rates and make the most of recyclable materials. “I’m pleased officers have been able to come up with an interim alternative which keeps us moving in the right direction. “Although landfill capacity is essentially reduced,recycling services are used to their full capacity most households should be able to cope and the use of the food waste bin means there should be no additional hygiene issues either.”Other changes to be introduced under the new Waste Strategy are still going ahead – including improvements to Household Waste Recycling Centres from this month and an increased number of garden waste collection points across the area this summer.Over half the materials in local non-recyclable waste bins are recyclable through existing services – equating to around , tonnes of recyclable materials being landfilled at a cost of £.million a year.Not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other essential council services."},{"url":null,"title":"changes to come at aberdeenshire hwrcs","story":"As part of Aberdeenshire#s sht towards greater recycling rates and sending less materials to landfill, tyres and asbestos will no longer be accepted at any of the area#s Household Waste Recycling Centresfrom Monday, June .The change, which also applies to four of the council’s waste transfer stations, is expected to save around £, a year and have minimal impact on householders. The money saved will be used to employ extra staff at recycling centres, who will advise customers how best to dispose of materials, helping to increase recycling rates and reduce disposal costs. Tyres are not classed as household waste and the council has no legal responsibility to deal with them – anyone buying new tyres can pay for disposal of the old ones at the same time. Although one of the lowest tonnages of any materials handled at HWRCs, tyres are one of the most expensive to dispose of. With very limited options to recycle or reuse them, they are currently sent to a cement kiln for use as fuel, at a cost to the council. Asbestos, only currently accepted by the council at four sites under limited circumstances, is currently sent to a specialist landfill site for disposal at signicant cost. Although tyres and asbestos together only account for less than .% of the waste handled by the council each year, neither method of dealing with these materials is classed as recycling. Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “We know a very small number of Aberdeenshire residents bring tyres or asbestos to the council for disposal. This service is an expensive one to provide and only benefits a few residents. “Neither of these materials contribute to the council’s recycling rate, but they do cost signicant amounts of money to deal with and take up space at the facilities where they are collected. “Requiring the person or company which generates this type of waste to ensure it is disposed of correctly at their expense not only saves the council money which is being reinvested in better services, it also frees up space for the recycling of other materials in future.“Many tyre retailers offer a disposal service for old tyres for a small fee and vehicle users should make use of this service where possible, as most people do.“There are commercial companies who will accept asbestos waste for disposal at two licensed landfill sites for a fee and anyone disposing of this material is advised to contact them.” Signs will be in place at facilities which have accepted the materials in the past advising of the change.

To enter the competition, members of the public should post a portrait photo celebrating walking in some way, on Twitter or Instagram, using the hashtag #HumansOfTheWalk. Multiple entries are allowed with the competition running until Friday, May , next week. Those who take part are in with the chance of winning a Nikon B Coolpix camera.Ian Findlay, chief officer at Paths for All, said: “Orkney has a number of great walking routes — whether it’s residential streets or local paths and green spaces — and we’re keen for the community to celebrate how they make these part of their daily routines.“We want the photos to be a true reflection of everyday walking — walking that builds friendships, gives you headspace and gets you feeling fitter and out enjoying nature.“Walking can help prevent ill health, build communities and create a happier, healthier, greener Scotland and we know that people can demonstrate just that with their Humans of the Walk photos. “We want to revolutionise the way people use their cities, and stop our spaces from being dominated by cars. Scotland’s towns and cities should be a backdrop for people walking, scooting, cycling or simply spending time enjoying cleaner, quieter, calmer streets.“Paths for All is looking forward to seeing them all and wish everyone who enters the competition the best of luck.”Paths For All#s aim is to signicantly increase the number of people who choose to walk in Scotland, whether it’s walking for leisure, to work, to school or to the shops. The charity works to create more opportunities and better environments for walking, as well as cycling and other activities to help make Scotland a more active and greener place.For more information on Humans of the Walk and the competition, visit: https:www.pathsforall.org.uk humanscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is both the highest volume of advance sales ever achieved in the voluntary-run festival’s -year tenure, as well as the greatest number of pre-festival sellouts. Stromness, the festival’s hometown in Orkney’s West Mainland, has already begun welcoming early arrivals, including some of this year’s furthest travelled visitors # Cape Breton’s globetrotting powerhouse quartet, Còig # as well as famed Irish singer Cara Dillon and Irish firebrands Four Men and a Dog, who are currently celebrating their th year on the road.Whilst early arrivals are no rarity for the festival, a far greater number than usual are already in Orkney, owing to a one-day Air Traffic Controllers’ strike across Scotland’s Highlands and Islands taking place today. As well as the closure of Kirkwall Airport, Inverness — a hub for flights from Ireland and England, before the final hop up to the islands — is also shut. With just a fortnight’s notice,  inbound arrivals originally scheduled for today, Thursday, have been rerouted, leading to early arrivals for most.Those already enjoying Orkney’s famed hospitality will soon be joined by fellow headliners including the groundbreaking Scottish three-piece, Lau a newly formed trio of celebrated Irish musicians John Doyle, Dermot Byrne and Éamonn Coyne and internationally renowned Hebridean vocalists, Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes, who visit Orkney as part ‘Between Islands’ # a collaborative project led by Stornoway’s An Lanntair, uniting musicians from Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. Emerging artists are also prominent in this year’s festival programme, with appearances from BBC Radio Scotland’s Young Musician of the Year , Benedict Morris new Scottish six-piece Heisk and Helensburgh fiddler Ryan Young, whose accompanist, Jenn Butterworth, will work a double-sht across the next four nights, also playing with the high-spirited Glasgow group Kinnaris Quintet. In total,  acts will meet in Stromness — with the  visiting acts welcomed and outnumbered by Orkney’s thriving local folk scene, which itself features internationally renowned artists such as Saltfishforty, The Chair, The Wrigley Sisters and Gnoss, alongside local favourites including Hullion, the Kirkwall City Pipe Band # currently celebrating their centenary year # and many more. This amounts to an estimated  featured musicians # though many more will meet in Stromness, with the town’s pubs and hotels bursting with informal pub sessions from opening to closing time across the four days, alongside the ticketed programme. As well as Stromness, this year the festival reaches out to communities in Birsay, Burray, Finstown, Kirkwall, Orphir, Quoyloo, Sanday, Sandwick, St Margaret’s Hope, Stenness and Tankerness.In order to stage such a large event, the festival gratefully receives generous support from public bodies and corporate sponsors, from throughout the local and national business communities. This year’s principal supporters are Orkney Islands Council, Creative Scotland, NorthLink Ferries, Loganair — who also facilitated the rebooking of all those affected by the air traffic strike at zero cost, the Pier Arts Centre, and EIS, alongside many more inidual event sponsors and corporate patrons. The festival also benefits from many thousands of hours donated by hundreds of volunteers, who give their time freely to bring the world-renowned event together. From the twelve-strong year round management committee, to those who might work on just one event in their local community hall, each one of the festival’s community team is vital to its long standing, continued and increasing success.Festival director, Bob Gibbon said: “After many months of preparation we are delighted to be welcoming visitors and artists from far and wide, friends old and new, musicians from across the globe, to Orkney for what is set to be a memorable weekend of fun and good times. #Everyone has come together create a magnicent programme of events, and the festival just gets better and better. Orkney should rightly be very proud of what we can share, and this weekend is about sharing music, memories, time and happiness. Enjoy it everyone!”The festival’s chair, Elaine Grieve added: #I say this every year but I#m really excited about the programme for the weekend. There#s something for everyone fabulous visiting acts and a great number of local artists — and that#s something we really want to share with audiences. #It#s such a lovely time with many familiar faces ing and new joining the fold # a bit like a huge family reunion!#Alan Morrison, head of music at Creative Scotland said: “There are few places in Scotland with a more magical atmosphere than Orkney, where the stones of past civilisations sit alongside the buzz of the modern world. That’s also true of the Orkney Folk Festival, where the island’s heritage is woven into music being made by some of our best standard-bearers and rising stars. #It’s great to see so many brilliantly talented artists sharing a bill with musicians from far and near – andsome of them had to arrive a day early, well, that just means the sessions are already underway.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Instead, it’s about our ability to act as decent human beings, to use reasoned arguments against those we disagree with and,these fail, to agree to disagree in a spirit of civility,perhaps not always friendship. And it’s also about our political leaders demonstrating that they are committed to these basic standards and disapprove of those who fail to live up to them.In recent times, we have seen MPs harrassed and intimidated outside the Westminster parliament, called “traitors” and “Nazis”, while throwing milkshakes has become so common that police have asked some fast-food restaurants to stop selling them when a particular type of politician is in the area.: Kenny MacAskill: Brexit-induced contempt for politicians is risk to democracyAnd yesterday, Police Scotland’s Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr told a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority that they had decided to deploy more than  officers to ensure public safety during today’s European Parliament elections. “We would have never normally done that in the past.

But the continual improvement of financial services, driven in part by Scotland’s booming fintech sector, enables us to understand our spending better now than ever before.window.twttr “Cash rules everything around me,” was the refrain of “C.R.E.A.M”, by the Wu-Tang Clan, commenting on the big-spending US rap music scene in the s. But the music stars of the future are unlikely to have the same reverence for dollar bills, pound notes, or indeed any other kind of physical currency.Thanks to the rapid development of smartphones and financial technologies, we all now have the ability to pay for pretty much anything without ever having to visit a cash machine.And fintech companies are now working closely with the established banking giants to better understand how people engage with both money and technology.Whether it’s getting an approval for a mortgage, or simply saving for a rainy day, technology is helping tailor better products to help us achieve our financial goals.Such products may not inspire any pop or rap hits of the future, but they are already an invaluable tool for many people.To develop such a consumer-led approach, the country’s fintech firms are busy trying to understand what drives our spending.Stephen Ingledew, the chief executive of FinTech Scotland, has had years of experience in the financial sector, where he has played an active and major role in implementing \u2028customer-focused and technology-enabled initiatives.As a former senior executive for large companies, such as Standard Le and Barclays, as well as smaller financial enterprises, he is ideally placed to help both with mutually beneficial enterprises.“Organisations are not just focusing on the emotional side,” he says. “What we’re involved in is how fintech people engage with money and technology.“The interesting thing about fintech is it does not start with finance or technology – it starts with the human need. Then companies work back to find out how they can better serve that need. It could be spending, it could be saving, it could be anything to do with money.”Ingledew admits that in the past, the big banks often adopted a one-size-fits-all approach to products. However, he is confident that fintechs can help change that.“Because you start with a human point of view, you are more likely to actually meet people’s real needs,” he adds. “That’s something financial services has not always done very well in the past. It has tended to rather push products on people rather than start with the need. Fintech is turning that upside down.“Fintech is helping banks take a much more consumer-led approach, rather than simply trying to sell a product.”Role of moneyThe FinTech Scotland boss is understandably keen to promote the innovative work already being done north of the Border. He cites MoneyMatiX as one example of a fintech company which helps customers better understand where their cash comes from and where it goes each month.He says: “MoneyMatiX is all about helping people understand the role of money – they call it financial literacy. If you’ve got a better understanding, you can make better decisions – whether to spend, whether to save, how best to pay.Castlight Financial, which offers real-time affordability and financial capability analysis, is another.Ingledew says: “Castlight Financial, based in Glasgow, helps customers really understand their ability to borrow money. “Rather than taking a credit score, they are understanding someone’s behaviour. How money is going in and out, how they are spending. How that could be improved so they can get a low rate of interest when they borrow.“They are focused on behaviour. One of those aspects is people’s emotional responses to what we buy and how we spend it. “The key thing about data is that it’s not just about financial data, or looking at someone’s financial record in a very narrow way. “What affordability assessment does is look at people’s data. Two people may get the same salary but their behaviour may be very dferent. One may be very frugal, one may be very spendthrt. That’s where behaviour becomes very important – instead of just looking at where the money comes from and where it goes out.”While the average bank customer may not be intimately familiar with fintechs, that does not mean that they have not already benefitted from their work.“None of these fintechs are going to become household names in the near future, like HSBC or RBS. What they are doing is helping the big institutions to reinvent themselves,” Ingledew observes. “They are behind the scenes.”“The strength of Scotland is we have these big companies here.

But Ms Sturgeon issued a stark warning about the impact on Scotland of such a scenario.“The prospect of an even more hardline Brexiteer now becoming PM and threatening a no deal exit is deeply concerning,” the First Minister said.The Prime Minister will remain in office until the leadership process is concluded.: Brexit: Theresa May pulls key legislation but tries to hold onThe timetable for the contest will see nominations close in the week of June , with MPs involved in a series of votes to whittle what is set to be a crowded field down to a final two contenders.The new Prime Minister will be faced with the immediate task of seeking to resolve the Brexit impasse which has proved beyond Mrs May.The UK was set to leave the EU in March, but an extension until October has been secured.French President Emmanuel Macron yesterday urged “swt clarication” on Brexit after Mrs May’s departure.And EU President Jean-Claude Juncker’s spokeswoman made it clear the new Prime Minister will have little room for manoeuvre in negotiations with Brussels.“Our position on the Withdrawal Agreement and anything  has been set out - there is no change to that,” she said.The Tory hierarchy promised that members and non-members would get the chance to question the would-be prime ministers during the election process.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May’s replacement should call an immediate general election.Mrs May’s statement came after a bitter backlash against her last effort to get a Brexit deal through Parliament.A Cabinet mutiny and the prospect of the backbench  Committee allowing another confidence motion eventually forced the Prime Minister’s hand.She insisted she had “done my best” to deliver Brexit and take the UK out of the European Union.But almost three years after the UK voted to break away from Brussels, Mrs May said: “It is, and will always remain, a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit.“It will be for my successor to seek a way forward that honours the result of the referendum.”Mr Hunt, MP for South West Surrey, heavily hinted he will join the race to replace Mrs May, telling his local newspaper the Farnham Herald: “I’ll make the announcement on my own candidacy at the appropriate time.”An ally of the Foreign Secretary told the Press Association “we will be saying more in the coming days about that”.Meanwhile, Mr Johnson was at a conference in Interlaken, Switzerland, and said he would seek to renegotiate the Brexit dealhe became prime minister.But he stressed that “you need to be prepared to walk away” without a dealnecessary in order to ensure the UK does actually leave the EU.Mr Raab, in a sign his campaign is gathering momentum, received a boost as Tory MP Helen Grant quit as a vice chairwoman of the party to back his leadership bid.She said the former Brexit secretary “has an inspiring vision for a fairer Britain and I think he is undoubtedly the best person to unite the Conservative Party and our country”.And Sir Graham Brady quit as the leader of the  Committee - a position which gave him a signicant role in the Prime Minister’s departure - in order to consider a leadership bid.He told the Press Association: “I have been approached by a number of colleagues across the party both inside and outside Parliament asking me to put myself forward as a candidate.“Therefore I have taken the decision to stand down from the position of chairman of the  Committee in order to ensure a fair and transparent election process.”Within minutes of the Prime Minister’s statement, Cabinet colleagues - including some who have ambitions to replace her - paid tribute to Mrs May.Environment Secretary Michael Gove - who stood in the  leadership race and may consider another bid - said Mrs May “deserves our respect and gratitude”.Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who had a “frank” discussion with Mrs May about her deal on Thursday, said “nobody could have worked harder or had a greater sense of public duty”.Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt was less effusive, but said the Prime Minister “put what she believed was in the national interest first”.Labour leader Mr Corbyn said: “The last thing the country needs is weeks of more Conservative infighting followed by yet another unelected prime minister.“Whoever becomes the new Conservative leader must let the people decide our country’s future, through an immediate general election.”Former prime minister David Cameron offered his sympathy to Mrs May, saying “I know how painful it is to accept that your time is up and a new leader is required”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon theresa may s departure enhances case for indyref2","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa#s May#s departure as Prime Minister makes the case for a second Scottish independence referendum #essential#, Nicola Sturgeon has said.But Tory leader Ruth Davidson rejected the call and warned that the new Prime Minister must show a commitment to Scotland’s place in the union.\u2028The First Minister warned that the prospect of a hardline Brexiteer replacing Mrs May as “deeply concerning” as it could mean the UK being ripped out of the EU without a deal on future arrangements.The SNP leader has already set out plans for a second referendum in the next two years and indicated that she is preparing to seek a Section  order, which would allow this, from Mrs May’s eventual successor.\u2028“For Scotland, the prospect of a hardline Brexiteer Tory becoming Prime Minister is not a happy one,” Ms Sturgeon said.“The people of Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU – and not only has that been completely ignored, but it is now clear that a devastating no-deal Brexit - which would cost jobs, businesses and livelihoods - is firmly back on the Tories’ agenda.“That makes it all the more essential that Scotland has a choice of becoming an independent country.”The Scottish Government is expected to publish legislation next week to hold a secopnd referendum but control over the constitution lies with Westminster and Mrs May had rejected calls from Ms Sturgeon for a repeat of the  vote.But Mrs May’s exit will not resolve the Commons stalemate over Brexit, Ms Sturgeon added.“It will not resolve Brexit itself,” he said.“Putting another Tory leader in Downing Street without a general election is not the solution to this crisis. “The only way to resolve Brexit is to put the issue back to the people.”But the SNP leader wished her departing Tory counterpart well for the future.“While we had many political disagreements - not least over her handling of Brexit and her disregard for Scotland and the Scottish Government - leadership is not easy, and Theresa May should be thanked for her service.”But Ms Davidson was quick to warn that any potential leadership candidate must take a strong line against a second referendum in order to win her endorsement.“Theresa May knew when she took on the job of Prime Minister that the challenges facing our country were unprecedented,” Ms Davidson said“Her time in office has been characterised by the hard work, resilience, quiet dignity and attention to detail for which she is known.“Above all, by opposing the SNP’s call for an immediate second independence referendum in , the Prime Minister demonstrated her resolute commitment to the Union, and to Scotland’s place in it.“As Britain’s second female Prime Minister, she has been a role model for girls and women across the United Kingdom, showing that there is no glass ceiling to their ambitions.“As leader of the Scottish Conservatives, I want to see candidates show that same level of commitment to Scotland’s place in the Union, an ability to advance our interests at home and abroad and, crucially, demonstrate how they intend to bring our country back together after the isions sown by two constitutional referenda.”West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP Andrew Bowie who served as Mrs May’s parliamentary private secretary paid tribute.“It has been the privilege of my le to serve such a dedicated, loyal, patriotic and thoroughly decent woman,” he said.“We saw again today why we have been so lucky to have her as leader of our party and country.”Labour leader Richard Leonard said Mrs May leaves the country “more ided” and has fallen short on her promise to tackle the “burning injustices” in society.“She will leave the country in chaos as a direct result of her refusal to compromise over self-imposed red lines on Brexit,” she said.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Mrs May faced “an impossible job” to deliver Brexit that would not damage the country. he said: “People have lost patience with the Conservatives. It’s clear they are going to be unable to get the country out of the mess they have made.

We never got to see the May agenda for the country, other than that glimpse in her speech about tackling the “burning injustices”. Her critics are right to point out how at odds with her own record that rhetoric was, nowhere more so than on the Windrush scandal, a product of policies she championed at the Home Office.Despite her aspirations, it will be leaving the EU - or rather, failing to - that defines May’s time in office, and rather than preparing the country for the most dficult task it has faced for half a century, she chose to define it in the most inane terms: “Brexit means Brexit”.She selected people to be the public face of negotiations in Brussels who had made clear their lack of interest in, and lack of understanding of how the EU worked. And she ruled out at the earliest opportunity the kind of Brexit that might have won the support of a majority in parliament. An unnecessary election was turned into a disaster by a manesto and a strategy written by a small circle of the Prime Minister’s advisers, who alienated much of her party.By using up the past three years on a Brexit deal she ensured was impossible to deliver, the Prime Minister may have closed off the avenue to any deal at all, radicalising Brexiteers and Remainers to only accept the purest solution to the messiest problem.When they’re revealed tomorrow night, the results of this week’s European elections will show for the largest part of the British public, Brexit now means what Nigel Farage wants it to mean, because May had the chance to forge a more subtle definition, but chose not to. The most affecting part of her speech yesterday, more so even than her tears, was when she quoted words of advice to her from her constituent, the late Sir Nicholas Winton, who saved hundreds of Jews from the Holocaust by organising the Kindertransport. “Never forget that compromise is not a dirty word,” he told her “Le depends on compromise.”How to reconcile those words with the fact it took two years from when Article  was triggered from May’s government to reach out to opposition parties and unions in a bid to find a middle way on Brexit The Prime Minister planted the seeds of ision in her first days in office, clearing out the remnants of David Cameron’s government in one of the most brutal reshuffles ever seen.George Osborne probably had to go, but May also got rid of senior ministers who she eventually had to turn to for help: Michael Gove, who she asked to come back to Cabinet and defended her approach on Brexit until the end and Nicky Morgan, who became one of the most troublesome rebels on the Tory benches before joining the effort to build bridges between Brexiteers and Remainers.At her first party conference as leader, May then took her purge of the Cameron project - the one that took the Tories back into power after  years, then won their first majority in more than  years - from staffing to ideology. In the confused, uncertain months after the referendum, Brexit Britain was in search of an identity. She gave it one when she told the party conference in Birmingham that “ you believe you are a citizen of the world, you’re a citizen of nowhere”. It confirmed, from the top of government, that the ide opening up in the country should be seen as a ‘culture war’ - and in the eyes of many, May had picked a side.Brexit wasn’t impossible to deliver in , but May will leave office having manoeuvred her party and the country into a near-impossible position, at the cost of huge anger on both sides of the ide. Her successor is likely to be someone even less willing to conciliate and compromise.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

Over the years my da became sole owner of the butchers, it was always called A’town Meats,” he said.Gerald said his father was the eldest of five children and that Tom’s three brothers and late sister all emigrated to Canada, with his father opting to stay in Ireland to raise his young family.“At one stage he had opened up a butchers shop in Poleglass, inside a group of shops at the time and a shop in Ladybrook which my brother Vincent ran. Dad sold the business in September  and stayed on because it was coming up to Christmas, up to the Christmas club and what is a very busy time. After Christmas he stayed on, right up until around March, April time when he started to feel unwell. He was told it was cancer and started radiotherapy in October last year.”Gerald continued: “The Christmas period was very bad as he was very anxious waiting on results following the treatment. It wasn’t that he got the all clear, but he was told everything seemed ‘positive’. He knew by the end of January, early February something wasn’t right, the pain started coming back and he was told that ‘it’ was back.“A week or so later he was told that it was terminal.”“He was in hospital about a fortnight and we took him out to bring him home. He was only out three weeks and one day when he passed away.”Gerald spoke poignantly of how A’town Meats was known as a “meeting place, a place for people to come and talk”.“People would come in for a yarn, for many it was their way of getting out of the house and a chance for conversation.”Gerald said his father was a founding member of the Donegal Celtic Football Club and loved the GAA, especially local clubs Lamh Dhéarg and Rossa.“Last year was the best year of his le as he got closer to his kids. He was always working. His kids, his grandkids,you wanted to go see him you went to the shop. Eventhe children were being baptised, made their communions, their confirmations, you brought them to the shop. He was there six-days a week. I would have seen him on Christmas Day going into the shop and getting burgers, getting whatever was needed for restaurants who would’ve contacted him needing food. He went round, opened up and made sure they were catered for.”As well as a prominent businessman, Gerald said his father was a “bookmaker as well”.“He applied his trade at Celtic Park, Drumbo, Dundalk and Dunmore, it was a hobby as much as anything . He loved to see people winning.”He added: “One of the first times he ever done the book, a fella ended up owing him over £, and he said he would have it up to the shop that Tuesday. When the guy came up to the shop, my da was still meeting and greeting the customers, they came first, they were the be all and end all.“Dad gave the man a large meat parcel and said to him ‘take that down to the house with you’. The fella said it was the first time he had owed someone money, paid it and actually left ‘with a smile on his face’. The fella brought it down to his family and they were saying how nice the meat was and he replied: ‘Well of course it is, it cost me £,!’”Gerald said his father could pick up on when his customers were going through hardship.“He knew without them having to say anything. He would give them some food just to help them out, he never spoke of it, it was the people who would come in and tell you how he had helped.“A wee woman came into the shop one Christmas and she couldn’t afford the turkey so she said she was just going to take a ‘wee chicken this year’ and offered a ring as a means of payment. He wouldn’t hear of it but the wee woman insisted on giving over the ring. The wee woman passed away and her daughters came into the shop months later and he said he had something belonging to them and brought out the ring.“He was a very private man and religious in his own ways. He would’ve walked from his house in Donegall Park to Clonard, walked down for the Rosary and to St Paul’s as well. He always kept himself fit, he did Slimming World in his ’s and went out of his way to get the accreditation to sell the Slimming World endorsed food in the shop. He had people coming from all over to buy it.“He was always reading and went back to get his Degree in History. He loved the horses, he was always saying I would ‘scud’ his bets, that I was the worst ‘picker in the world’.“At the end of the day he was a very hard working, very generous, honest man. All his le he would’ve said ‘I’m doing this for you, I’m doing this for you’, in terms of working so hard at the business. He loved his family.”Gerald’s daughter and Tom’s granddaughter, Charleen Straney, described her “granda” as “a much loved man and very highly thought of by everyone who got to know him.”Tom Straney’s Requiem Mass will take place todayin St Agnes’ Church at noon."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"finucane new lord mayor of belfast","story":"JOHN Finucane said his father was in his thoughts as he was officially made the new Lord Mayor of Belfast last night.The Sinn Féin councillor, a new face on Belfast City Council, was nominated by the party for the position of the city’s first citizen.John’s father, prominent Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane was shot dead in  by a state-controlled loyalist gang in front of his family.Speaking in the Chamber at the council’s AGM on Tuesday evening, John said: “Tonight is a special night for them and, of course, for me.“And of course never far from my thoughts, more so on a night like tonight, is my father Pat. “I know my dad would be proud tonight as my entire family are, as am I, of the position being elected Mayor of Belfast places me in.”John added that his focus for the year ahead will be on ersity and inclusiveness.“As Mayor, I want to bring a message of ersity and inclusiveness to the year ahead.“I have been brought up and lived my le in an inclusive, welcoming environment where dference and ersity are embraced and celebrated, and I am proud of that.“I am the product of a mixed marriage, of a Catholic father from West Belfast, and a Protestant mother from East Belfast. “I have relatives who are unionist and I have relatives who are republican. “My upbringing has shown me that everyone deserves to be, and must be, treated equally.“I want a strong, vibrant Belfast in which political persuasion, sexuality, religious choice or skin colour make no dference as to how a citizen is treated. “I want a Belfast where we champion the rights of the most vulnerable in our society and do so proudly, without fear, without favour.“I will never accept that undeniable rights are merely privileges, to be given and taken from those in need by those in power. “It is my intention as Mayor to convene a special conference to celebrate the vibrancy and ersity in this city and to show how that fantastic ersity can enrich our city and the lives of all our citizens.“As Mayor I will reach out the hand of friendship and do my best to help build a future we can all be proud of.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rio is on the ball on the springfield road","story":"FORMER Manchester United and England footballer Rio Ferdinand was in West Belfast on Tuesday to officially open the new office of one of the UK’s top football agencies at the Innovation Factory on the Springfield Road.Rio is an ambassador for New Era Global Sports Management, which is the first big name football agency to open an office in the North –their first office outside of London.New Era Global Sports believes in a holistic approach, supporting players throughout their careers and into retirement and Rio is hopeful the agency can make an impact here.“There has been so many good Irish players – Roy Keane, Robbie Keane, Jonny and Corry Evans, John O’Shea, Craig Cathcart, I could go on,” said Rio.“There are loads here and there will be more coming through.“It is about nurturing and creating the pathway for these players. The amount of lads leaving here for England but ing a year later is far too high. It is not about their football ability but due to a lack of support network for them.“There is that fear factor of moving away and we want to help them stay on the ladder.“It is an important moment for New Era. There is so much talent in Ireland and now we have a place to facilitate them.”The Innovation Factory office will be run by former professional footballer, Lee Mudd, who says the agency was drawn by the vast untapped potential talent throughout the island of Ireland.“There are a lot of talented young players here and having an office in Belfast will provide them with the opportunity to make it on a bigger stage. We currently have  players on our books from Ireland and Northern Ireland and I would expect this to grow considerably in a short time as there is so much potential here.“We recognise that it is an enormous challenge for a young person to leave this country and go to live in England. It is important to provide them with a support network.

The fatal flaws still remain. The backstop is still there meaning Northern Ireland could be cut off from its main market in Great Britain by a new regulatory border. \"Unless there are treaty level changes, Brussels would always have the whip hand.\"Mrs May yesterday set out a -point compromise package in her final attempt to secure approval for her deal, which has already been rejected in Parliament three times.She is to offer MPs a vote on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum in a last-ditch effort to secure support in the House of Commons.Her new Brexit deal, which was agreed by Cabinet only after a stormy two-hour session, will be brought to Parliament in the first week of next month.As well as a vote on a second referendum, MPs will be offered a choice over the UKs future customs arrangements with the European Union.TUV leader Jim Allister rounded on the Prime Minister for opening the door to a second referendum. He said Mrs Mays deal was nothing new but \"rather another attempt to force her failed, rejected plan through Westminster\".He added: \"What it does contain is another massive climbdown this time on a second referendum.

Effectively, it leaves us in the waiting room for Irish unity,\" he added.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle ONeill said: \"The majority of people of the North did not consent to Brexit and rejected it at the polls. \"The new offer announced by Theresa May contains little new thinking. Westminster is in chaos and what we heard today from Theresa May will do little to convince the business community or anyone  here that is likely to change.\"Ulster Unionist EU election candidate Danny Kennedy said: \"The very fact that the Prime Minister has made this speech less than  hours before polls open in an election to the European Parliament is symptomatic of the chaotic state of her Government at this time. The fact remains there should never have been a backstop in the first place and it was poor negotiations that resulted in its inclusion.\" Alliance leader Naomi Long said: \"Those saying the case for another vote was delusional have been proven wrong. We have not left the EU yet - the decision can be reversed and Brexit stopped.\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would consider the Prime Ministers plan, but warned: \"We wont back a repackaged version of the same old deal, and its clear that this weak and disintegrating Government is unable deliver on its own commitments.\"Mrs Mays proposals were immediately rejected by Tory Brexiteers. Boris Johnson tweeted: \"We are being asked to vote for a customs union and a second referendum. The Bill is directly against our manesto - and I will not vote for it.

Hotels currently have a wage content of around % of turnover.\"The sector has a iety of roles from entry level at the appropriate national minimum wage level of the candidate through to supervisory, management and executive roles.\"The Federation has not seen the evidence that the LPC received last week and therefore is not in a position to answer the specics. Nor have the NIHF been made aware of working conditions contra to current national minimum wage levels by any trade union official or employee in the Derry-Londonderry area.\"Ms Gault added: \"Allegations of this nature are very damaging and without having specic examples are impossible to abate.\"As an industry we have done much to improve our image: improving working hours, providing strong and well rewarded career paths and supporting qualications that give employees the opportunity to have greater skills to work globally.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Niall McCarroll, chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council, and members of Aegis in meeting with the Low Pay Commission."},{"url":null,"title":"foyle hospice weekly draw results winner","story":"Winners in this weeks Foyle Hospice Weekly Draw are - st prize: £,, Paul Breslinnd prize: £,, Rollover : rd prize: £, Terry Monaghanth prize: £, Diarmuid Campbellth prize: £, William Linton .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"spencer road closed traffic travelling city side","story":"Traffic travelling from Craigavon Bridge is currently being erted away from Spencer Road after a bus became stuck at the junction of Spencer Road and Fountain Hill.It is the same junction where lorries have become stuck in recent months.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe PSNI said: \"Spencer Road and Fountain Hill remain closed due to a vehicle blocking both Roads and will be for a period of time.\"Please avoid the area and delays should be expected.

Some say while those carrying out the work are obliging, they are not responsible the delay or the lack of communication.Businesses are also hoping that customers they have not seen for some time willwhen Irish Street s to a sense of normality.They say the loss of parking spaces has impacted on trade with the work forcing people not to use one of the townrsquos main car parks nearby.During last weekrsquos protest, one trader revealed that her business has been forced to go mobile, visiting the homes of elderly people who cannot safely access her premises in the town centre due to the public realm scheme.Restaurant owner Mizba Uddin says things have been ldquoterrible for his business since work on the project began.ldquoThe business has literally collapsed, he declared, standing outside his restaurant surrounded by barriers used by contractors.ldquoThe situation is very, very bad and we have even have people driving down the one-way system the wrong way. Parking spaces have been lost as a result of the work and not all will be ed when the scheme is completed. People are going where as we do not provide a delivery service.Mizba said one of his main concerns has been the lack of communication from those overseeing the project. He also urged those in charge of the scheme to talk to traders to let them know what is going on.He added: ldquoI was told that the scheme would end in March and have heard nothing since. I am relying on other people to tell me what is going on but it should not be like this. I cannot even clean my windows because there is so much dust everywhere.ldquoSummer time can be quiet for me. Everyone in Irish Street wants this project completed as quickly as possible. As the work continues, there are simply no customers going to any of the shops. The work is killing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget woman’s two week walk meeting inspirational people  ","story":"A BALLYGALGET woman is one of two volunteers who are spending a fortnight walking in towns and villages around Northern Ireland meeting inspirational people who are improving their communities.Patricia Fleming, a former camogie player with Ballygalget John Mitchelrsquos GAC, called into her old club last Sunday accompanied by Rory Mullan from Derry.They were hand-picked from a raft of candidates to be Big Lunch walkers for this year.Starting last Friday, they are visiting dferent places in Northern Ireland ahead of the Big Lunch weekend on June -.The Big Lunch event is where over six million people through the UK will meet to share food and eat together.Patricia and Rory visited Ballygalget to hear about all the great work the club does in the surrounding area.Patricia, who now lives in Belfast with her family, told the club how its community work was inspiring.ldquoThe reason I picked Ballygalget is that Irsquom from here, Irsquove played on that pitch many times, but I also know the community spirit that exists within Ballygalget. It blows me away when I come home and hear all the things that are happening.ldquoWhen I went for my interview after applying to be one of the Big Lunch walkers, I said thatI was chosen I would like to bring the Big Lunch community walk into rural areas and to Ballygalget.ldquoPeople here are very community oriented. That is not the case everywhere. A lot of people donrsquot feel able to knock on their neighboursrsquo doors.The club hosted a Big Breakfast fundraiser on Sunday towards sending the clubrsquos U- boys and girls to next monthrsquos Feile in Cork.However, the club is also trying to gather support for a huge number of projects, including cross-community work and is also going to host its own event over the Big Lunch weekend.A new cross-community gym opened in the club grounds a year ago, which has proven immensely popular with all sorts of people in the local area, including many who had no links with the GAC.The new building also has space for social workshops and some of the wider community schemes the club wants to pursue.Last year, Ballygalget won an Alzheimerrsquos Society Diversity Award for its work in the community.Club member Roisin Coulter said: ldquoWe are working to become a dementia-friendly community. The idea is to educate people about dementia: what are the signs and symptoms, and how to support someone living with the condition.ldquoEvery month we run a free two-hour workshop, with materials supplied by the Alzheimerrsquos Society.ldquoOur club is very much affected by dementia. Quite a number of people in the club are living with a diagnosis within their families. We want to reduce stigma and the social isolation people can feel.Aoe Savage, Ballygalget GACrsquos Health Club Officer, added: ldquoWe are working against social isolation within our area.ldquoWe are trying to improve health and wellbeing ndash both physical and mental health ndash of people who live nearby, on a cross-community basis.Ballygalget was the walkersrsquo third stop on their tour around Northern Ireland. They have already visited Belfast and Balmoral Show.Over the next two weeks will visit other places including Lisnaskea, Portadown, Ballymoney and Derry.There is still plenty of time to sign up at www.edenprojectcommunities thebiglunchhomepage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Businessman calls for work to be completed quickly  ","story":"IRISH Street businessman Darren Trainor said the public realm scheme needs to be completed quickly for the benefit of everyone in the town.He saidthose in charge of the scheme told traders that they planned to deploy more men to finish it earlier they would put up with the disruption for a just a little longer.And asking for businesses to be provided with up-to-date information, Mr Trainor appealed to those in charge ldquocome and talk to us.He continued: ldquoWe received a letter informing us that the work would be completed on March . We are all so frustrated that this scheme has taken so long and we have lost regular customers which over a month or two would be fair enough, but over six or seven, you are not going to get them back.ldquoWe have been in business for over  years andit was not for that we probably would have closed by now. The first plan I viewed showed two parking spaces outside my door but they have been taken away.Businessman Francie Young, who is also upset about the y delay, also questioned the design of the scheme, pointing to a wide footpath at the top of Irish Street, close to the John Street junction.ldquoThe road will be considerably narrower at this point and can anyone tell me the reason for this  he asked, while Maurice Massey was critical of the lack of communication with Irish Street business owners, particularly in relation to the delay in completing the work.He said the business community should have been much better informed, with greater account taken of the impact the delayed scheme was having on trade.Alan Oakes said ldquocustomers have gone with businesses unsurethey will . He also appealed for better lines of communication between traders and those in charge of the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the work in Irish Street is impacting on patients attending a dental surgery, with those most affected the elderly and those with mobility problems.Traders say they are simply asking for communication and to be told what is happening, with the major concern that a project scheduled to last a few months had now entered its fth month, with work on only one side of the street largely completed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity concert  in Seaforde  ","story":"A CONCERT takes place in Seaforde tomorrow night in aid of a Parkinsonrsquos charity.The locally-based Harmonic Progression womenrsquos community choir will be presenting their spring concert, entitled Makers of Music and Dreamers of Dreams, in Seaforde YFC Hall at .pm.Rehearsals are well underway for the concert which is inspired by the first line of Arthur OrsquoShaughnessyrsquos Ode.One of the choir members, Heather Knipe, and her husband, John, are climbing Mount Fuji in Japan for the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust and all donations at the door and from a raffle will be presented to this charity during the concert.Harmonic Progression.

The video was well received and no doubt there will be more versions in the future.Bruce Grobbelaar then rose, to a rapturous reception to deliver one of the slickest and wittiest after dinner speeches the club has heard.Stories from his early days as a  year old lsquokeeper with Highlanders FC, a Zimbabwean football club based in Bulawayo, to an eventual move to Vancouver Whitecaps and subsequent transfer to Crewe Alexandria until the legendary Bob Paisley signed him for Liverpool in .Grobbelaar played  times for the Reds in a trophy-laden career. Among the stories he told were e the events of May , , when his antics in a penalty shoot out against Roma helped Liverpool to win the European Cup.He also talked about his career after Liverpool and working with Alan Ball at Southampton at the height of the match fixing allegations that were made against him.When Ball was asked by the media why he was playing Grobbelaar in goal ahead of England international Dave Beasant, Ball reputedly said: ldquoI would rather have Bruce in goal trying to throw the game than Dave doing his best to save it.By common consensus, Bruce was one of the best speakers the club has had and has whetted the appetite for the future to renew the clubrsquos tradition of bringing over guest speakers.Bruce was presented with a small gt from the club by youth team coach Simon Thornton, a set of golf balls and towel from the Royal County Down Golf Club.Club secretary Andy Hall then spoke for a few minutes to highlight some of the highs and lows of the last  years and to thank IFA regional development officer Seamus Heath for all the work he does in promoting football across the Newry Mourne and Down Council area.Andy then invited IFA vice-chairman Jack Grundie to say a few words with Jack presenting the club with a gt to mark the occasion.County Antrim FA president Jim Jess also spoke warmly about the club and presented a memento to mark the occasion with Maurice Johnston, vice chair of the Mid Ulster Football League, congratulating the club on their th anniversary and presenting Tollymore chairman John McIlvenny with a gt to recognise the achievement.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig was unfortunately taken ill before the dinner and was unable to attend and the club sends its warm wishes to him for a speedy recovery.The final official speaker was Elaine Junk, the former chair of the NI Womenrsquos Football Association during the period when Tollymore had a successful ladiesrsquo side.Elaine congratulated the club on its th anniversary and encouraged them to get a ladiesrsquo team back up and playing.With the official proceedings drawing to a close there was one last surprise with Adrian Howard presenting a le time achievement award on behalf of players and members to Andy Hall in recognition of all his work for the club.It was a wonderful gesture by the club and much appreciated by Andy.The evening concluded with dancing to the wonderful Fth Avenue with Bruce continuing to sign autographs and pose for pictures into the wee small hours..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Locals flying high in F15 championship  ","story":"ROGER Chamberlain and Charlie Horder won the Northern Ireland Flying Fteen Championship on Strangford Lough at the weekend.It was a deserved triumph for the Whiterock duo and also for Strangford Sailing Club, which hosted the event less than a month after the re-opening of its clubhouse which was gutted by an accidental fire in September .The five-race championship attracted a -strong fleet, which included a sizeable contingent of southern visitors, mainly from Dun Laoghaire.After three races on Saturday Chamberlain and Horder were in third place, behind Killyleagh pair Andrew McCleery and Colin Dougan mdash who got off to a flyer by winning the opening race mdash and overnight leaders Brian McKee and John Gibson, also from Whiterock, who were second and seventh in the first two races before winning the final race of the day.Chamberlain and Horder came out of the blocks early on Sunday and comfortably won the fourth race before sealing the championship with fth place in the final race.McKee and Gibson were a disappointing th in the fourth race, but with the discard brought into play, they still had a chance of outright victory.

beyond his power’ in Loughinisland report  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos Police Ombudsman went beyond his legal powers in publishing a report ldquoreplete with determinations that RUC officers colluded with loyalists in the Loughinisland massacre, the Court of Appeal heard last week.Lawyers for two retired senior policemen claimed the watchdogrsquos damning findings on the Loughinisland atrocity should only have been releasedit had recommended prosecutions or disciplinary action against any of those under scrutiny.Judgment was reserved in the renewed bid by Raymond White and Ronald Hawthorne to have the report quashed.UVF gunmen opened fire at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, Co Down as their victims watched a World Cup football match in June .The men killed were: Adrian Rogan , Malcolm Jenkinson , Barney Green , Daniel McCreanor , Patrick OrsquoHareand Eamon Byrne .Five others were also wounded in a sectarian attack for which no-one has been brought to justice.In June  the Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said collusion between some officers and the loyalists was a signicant feature in the murders.He found no evidence police had prior knowledge, but identied ldquocatastrophic failings in the investigation.Mr White, representing the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officersrsquo Association, and Mr Hawthorne, a former sub-isional police commander, have been involved in a long-running legal challenge to the published findings.A first hearing resulted in a ruling in  that the report was procedurally unfair and had failed to make clear it conclusions did not apply to Mr Hawthorne.At that time the watchdog agreed to remove any references to him to ensure he is not connected to any alleged wrongdoing mdash a move seen as complete vindication for the former police commander.A limited re-hearing before a dferent judge focused only on issues around the extent of the powers to publish the findings.In November last year a High Court judge rejected the retired officersrsquo case that Dr Maguire had exceeded his legal remit.Mr White and Mr Hawthorne are now now appealing that ruling.The former policemenrsquos barrister, David McMillen QC, stressed their complete support for the Ombudsmanrsquos role in scrutinising and holding officers to account.He argued, however, that the watchdog lacked the legislative authority to publish such ldquoconclusive findings in the Loughinisland report.ldquoHe simply does not have that power, Mr McMillen said.ldquoThis is an organ of the state, an important and very public organ of the state finding police officers guilty.Askedhe believed the Ombudsmanrsquos report had concluded police officers may have committed criminal offences, Mr McQuillen replied: ldquoIt was replete with those suggestions.But Mr McMillen rejected suggestions that the document could be amended to state there ldquomay be evidence of criminal or disciplinary offences.ldquoThe report is so infected with conclusive language all the way through, about what he found, that a simple rider would not make sense, he said.Barra McGrory QC, for the Ombudsman, countered that the legislation allowed him to express an opinion on the alleged collusion.He said: ldquoThe definition the Ombudsman has set out on collusion is broad enough to encompass behaviour and actions by police officers which cannot be identied as specic criminal offences which could be referredunder that part of the scheme.Following submissions Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, sitting with Lord Justices Stephens and Deeny,

householders across Newry, Mourne and Down can now put their glass into their blue bins.ldquoWe should see an marked improvement in recycling figures and a decrease in the percentage of glass placed in black bins across the entire council area.Mr Doherty said local authorities need to encourage the maximum number of people to recycle the maximum volume of materials, weighed against the cost of processing the material, and the potential financial benefits from reducing landfill costs, and selling on recyclable material.ldquoThe councils we with work in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland tell us that household friendly schemes such as commingling recyclables, plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard and glass in one bin, are much preferable to residents than any pre-sort scheme using

Kielty has called for an end to the segregation of education along religious lines in Northern Ireland.He believes that someone like Good Friday Agreement peace talks chairman George Mitchell could be the man tasked with the job of overhauling the countryrsquos ldquoided schools.At an Ulster University event in Belfast last week focusing on sectarianism, the Dundrum man said the segregated education issue needed to be addressed.He also criticised what he described as the ldquocasual sectarianism and ldquotribalism which characterises parts of society.He continued: ldquoI think we really have to address education, segregated education and I think that as a society we kind of have to start calling out that casual sectarianism.ldquoWhenever we had peace here we thoughtwe move on to a Glaswegian level of sectarianism that is fine, so we only hate each other every week when we go to football. That is not good enough. The tribalism of that is not good enough.The comedian also suggested that the integrated education term was ldquoinsulting.He explained: ldquoAround the rest of the world that is called education. What we have in this country is segregated education.The Dundrum man also paid tribute to the ldquobrilliant work of teachers but said people felt those high standards were enough and did not tackle the underlying ision.ldquoThe natural  of mixing and realising that we are exactly the same and having a school that has got a rugby team and a GAA team, you donrsquot have to go to that schoolyou like GAA. There are just certain things that we really need to have a look at and I am not sure that we are necessarily ready for it.Speaking at the Belfast event, Mr Kielty argued that changing the education system would have to be done by an international figure like former US senator George Mitchell.ldquoOnce we actually get through it we will go, lsquogee why didnrsquot we do that before now rsquo, but it is a dficult one, he conceded, suggesting that social media is contributing to the lack of exposure to dferent views.ldquoYour own opinion is folded back into yourself on the screen every day, he said. ldquoMore than ever, we actually have to put the screen down and make an effort to realise that we are the same.ldquoWe talk too much about dference here. You are either a British person living on the island of Ireland or you are an Irish person who is currently actually in the UK. You are actually a bit of both.Mr Kielty added: ldquoThe minute that we accept that that is going to move in a fluid way, and it is perfectly fine to be a bit of both, that is kind of where we need to be.Meanwhile, the charity which has been working for almost three decades to bridge the gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government support has welcomed Ulster University proposals for a concerted effort in Northern Ireland to eradicate sectarianism.The university, supported by the Sir George Quigley Fund, launched lsquoSectarianism in Northern Ireland: a Reviewrsquo at a conference at the UUrsquos Belfast campus last week.The Integrated Education Fundmdash which was established in  mdash praised the conference for addressing the issue and welcomed Patrick Kieltyrsquos comments that educating all children together is the way forward for a shared future.The review contains more than  proposals for how bodies including government, business, education, youth services, arts and sport could work collectively over a sustained period of time to foster greater collaboration and understanding across communities.As well suggesting that a government department should be established specically to tackle sectarianism, the researchers propose establishing a new civic body to help shape community efforts toward reconciliation.IEF chief executive Tina Merron said the organisation ldquoshares the vision, held by the overwhelming majority of citizens, of a united community and a shared future.Ms Merron said that at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were , pupils in  integrated schools, compared with more than , attending  integrated schools today.She said that with no government plan for integrated education, the growth was down to ldquodetermined campaigners and pioneering parents.She added: ldquoWe see a reformed education system as an essential ingredient of this future an education system which brings children, staff and governors from Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as those of other faiths or none and of other cultures, together in schools, an education system which recognises and respects ersity and ensures that all young people feel confident and welcome in their school environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein’s Casey chosen as district’s first citizen  ","story":"SINN Feinrsquos Charlie Casey is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos new chairman.The Newry politicianrsquos appointment was confirmed at the local authorityrsquos annual meeting on Monday night when he succeeded the SDLPrsquos Mark Murnin as the districtrsquos first citizen.The new council vice-chairman is Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews, who succeeded Sinn Feinrsquos Oksana McMahon, who represented the Crotlieve area but lost her seat in the recent local government election.The new chairman was presented with his chain of office by his predecessor, who also losthis Slieve Croob seat at the recent election.The new first citizen said he was delighted to be nominated for the position by his party and hoped to do the position justice, urging all councillors to unite to protect services under the threat in the council area, particularly those in relation to the health and welfare of all, in particular, the most vulnerable.Cllr Casey also took time to thank Mr Murnin and Mrs McMahon for their work over the past year and the other councillors who were not ing to the council following the election.Addressing members as chairman for the first time, Cllr Casey urged them to fight for lesaving and le-changing services, champion the cause of equality and take forward the councilrsquos commitment of putting the organisation at the heart of everything it does.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos mission is to lead and serve the district as a prosperous and healthy area and ensure it is sustainable from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

When Mrs May got emotional in Downing Street yesterday as she announced her departure, few people will have doubted her patriotism. Her commitment to Northern Ireland and unionism was also clear. All four Tory prime ministers of the last  years have been unionist: Margaret Thatcher, John Major, David Cameron and Mrs May.But like Mrs Thatcher and the  Anglo Irish Agreement, Mrs May was persuaded that to secure her unionist vision she had to agree to signicant constitutional change for the sake of political harmony and wellbeing on the island of Ireland. The end result was the backstop of .Had that backstop merely resulted in constitutional damage to Northern Ireland, Mrs May might have survived. But in her determination to avoid a border of any type, in the Irish Sea or at land, Mrs May had to dilute UK-wide Brexit, and so alienated grassroots Brexiteers.She made a massive error in accepting the EU insistence that the Irish border matter be settled before the UK could even get agreement on the terms of its departure from the EU. The question now is whether her successor will have the will to recty that blunder.And still we wait for action over Troubles pension cash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. bullock on the loose incident resolved say P.S.N.I.Stephen Nolan shocks social media with astonishing weight loss photosDrink driving collision at lunchtime today -

The man behind the bright, brash paintings of tattooed tough-guys and sultry sexpots, must be a cocksure-type, all patter, swagger, and chutzpah  Wrong.Oneof Bradleys new pieces, BleueEven though testimonials to his work’s redoubtable allure are not hard to come by - Madonna, Bono, Bee Gee Barry Gibb, fashion designer John Rocha and pop star Ronan Keatingall have several Bradleys on their walls - the north Belfast-born artist, is saddled with low self-esteem.‘‘I never used the word artist for years because I was uncomfortable with that - I just do what I do,’’ he says.Bradley, ,who yesterday unveiled Le Stories, a group of  intimate pieces, which he describes as his most personal collection to date, isno stranger to mental health struggles. ‘‘I have problems with depression and anxiety and have done for years. This is the most powerful and honest work I have every doneand I am property bricking it, I am really nervous. I have put my heart and soul into it and it is powerful imagery, I think. People who have seen some bits of it - seem to feel that way about it.’’Bradley with his we Ashley and three childrenBradley has been building up to this collection for years, so why does he feel the time is now right to bare his soul ‘‘I feel freer now because I am a bit older and also my work has pushed me into a corner where you have to be totally honest - there’s nowhere at all to hide.’’As long as there has been art, music, poetry, literature, there has always been the romantic notion of the tortured genius, arty and angsty in his lonely garret.Whilst Bradley may not exist in a lonely garret, he does believe his fragile mental health is the driving force behind his art, and is certain painting and creating provide balm for his torments.‘‘It helps me cope with my nerves and my problems with my anxiety. It’s a coping mechanism.’’Bradley believes his problems with mental health ‘were always there’ and have their roots in his childhood. He grew up just off the Shankill Road where his mother tried to keep him and his siblings inside and away from the Troubles outside their front door ‘‘I think by staying off the streets a lot more , I didn’t have as many social skills.

It’s a strange thing.’’The artist who is married to Ashley, a former medical photographer, and has three children,works hard at trying to ‘‘stay on a level’’. He takes medication, sees a psychiatrist, walks. ‘‘If I was getting really anxious, it’s like a fear and it’s a fear of nothing. It’s the most annoying thing in the world, it’s just so irrational - it does my head in.’’Bradley’swork is a stream of consciousness poured out ontocanvas, often centring on strong and powerful women, such as the burlesque dancers of Paris, and the colourful characters from the Belfast dockland area, Sailortown, famous for their hard drinking and hard-working attitude.‘‘I start off with something and it evolves and everything changes with how I feel.’’But Bradley, who doesn’t even have an O’Level in art and admits he doesn’t knowhe is ‘right or wrong, technique-wise,’ has had his fair share of criticism over the years, with many claiming his work is nothing more than interior decoration art, the type beloved by the nouveau riche and celebs with more money than taste. Does the criticism hurt ‘‘No . I was more bothered at the start. Because I have no background in art education I always just did what I felt - it’s not real art. I thought, I’m just doing my own thing. But then people started to ask methey could buy things. I wasn’t a part of any gallery, it just evolved.’’Bradley, who now does own a gallery on Bangor’s High Street, with pieces selling from three figures to six, adds:‘‘About two-thirds of people who come to my place haven’t bought any art before and a lot of it is because they feel allowed, they don’t feel intimated - it’s a big part of why I wanted the gallery to be open and big and have prices on things.’’Indeed, held during Mental Health Week, he used the launch event to support local mental health charities and encourage their members to come along...all this, whilst trying to avoid the limelight. ‘‘Everywhere I go there seems to be somebody who knows what I do for a living and that builds upmy anxiety - I am not comfortable with compliments, I find it hard to handle - I always deflect it.’’try catch  TrendingN.I. bullock on the loose incident resolved say P.S.N.I.Stephen Nolan shocks social media with astonishing weight loss photosDrink driving collision at lunchtime today -

Turnout has been mediocre, with a majority of those eligible to vote having chosen not to do so.Last night the Electoral Office confirmed that turnout was .%. That is down on the last European election in  which had a .% turnout and also down on the .% turnout in the council elections three weeks ago.Whatever the outcome, the low turnout is somewhat baffling. While an upset for the third seat – involving either Naomi Long, Colum Eastwood or Jim Allister taking it from the UUP – would be signicant, its signicance is diminished by the fact that most people have not voted, despite the enormity of what is at stake.For three years, Britain’s departure from the EU has dominated political debate and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. It is a topic on which few people are neutral and about which a large percentage of the population feel passionately.Northern Ireland, as the sole part of the UK sharing a land border with an EU state, will be the most immediately and acutely impacted by such a fundamental change.It is also the part of the UK where the relative constitutional contentment of a signicant section of the population has been upset, with wider destabilising consequences.This was the closest we have come to a second referendum and involved candidates standing on manestos of working to reverse Brexit or to implement it.How then to explain the apparent indference of a majority of the population  Where is the surge in particular of ‘civic nationalism’ which has been most unhappy at the initial Brexit vote The turnout is reminiscent of the EU referendum itself which saw a .% turnout,  percentage points lower than the UK-wide turnout. The turnout in the West Tyrone was, unprecedentedly, lower than North Down on the east coast of Northern Ireland – despite the former being on the border, where Brexit will have an obvious impact, and the latter being the furthest constituency from the border. The turnout in the republican heartland of West Belfast was lower than in the Assembly election just a few weeks earlier. Yet, having not turned out in great numbers to vote in the referendum, there was unquestionable shock, dismay and anger across much of nationalism after the result went in favour of Leave.Among the explanations proffered for the lower nationalist turnout in that contest was the sense that Brexit had been an intra-Tory argument from which Irish nationalists felt remote. But while that may have been the case in , the practical impact of Brexit in Northern Ireland is now indisputable.There are other factors which might explain why so many have this time chosen not to vote – a general weariness with politics, resignation towards Brexit due to Northern Ireland’s small size and disillusionment with a last-minute election to choose MEPs who may only serve a few months in office.Ben Lowry: The prime minister is a unionist who reluctantly felt she had to agree to damage the Union Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The DUP and Sinn Féin were also restrained in how they campaigned, aware both of the security of their seats and the likelihood of an expensive general election campaign later this year.It is clear – both anecdotally and through polling – that there are deep concerns about Brexit, particularly from nationalists and centrist voters. But the fact that most of the electorate could not be bothered to vote at all – let alone come out en masse to oppose Brexit – undermines pro-EU parties’ arguments about the fervency of Northern Ireland’s opposition to leaving the EU.It would be dangerous to assume that a low turnout in these unique circumstances equals indference by every non-voter. But this turnout does nothing to boost the Remain camp within Northern Ireland.try catch  TrendingN.I. bullock on the loose incident resolved say P.S.N.I.Stephen Nolan shocks social media with astonishing weight loss photosDrink driving collision at lunchtime today -

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Members of local chapels and churches processed from the Twyn through Dinas Powys passed Tesco at Nica, ending at Bethesda Chapel.Fish and chips sustained around  walkers by the end of the evening.Rev Jon Davis of the Baptist Church and the Revs Carole and Phil Challis of the Methodists led the service with the first hymn, Light of the World. The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is a piece of disused waste groundwe have had it signed over to us. Tullygally PS pupils in a game of Tug of War at Lurgans Centrepoint“Pat will come over and he will introduce his Train B Smart and we can work out of his Hub.“Early intervention is key to get those children knowing the mental and physical well-being is the way forward. That will also have a bigger influence then on the parents and the wider community.”Ms Andrews is mindful that the school pitch is currently unused because of the anti-social behaviour. She is keen that this project moves forward for the sake of the children and the community.“But without the funding, we can’t move forward. The EA has already signed over the pitch and council are working hard to give us the waste ground behind it but without a working Assembly, I am afraid this will be a missed opportunity.Tullygally PS pupils in a game of Tug of War at Lurgans Centrepoint“We need £, to make this project work and start building the Train B Smart Hub at Tullygally Primary School,” she said.But the Hub won’t be just for Tullygally PS, as Pat explains: “The whole idea with Train B Smart is for the local and wider community to be able to participate in multi-sports. That’s the key aim. We know not everybody is going to be an elite athlete, that’s not the point. The point is that everybody can get enjoyment out of it. This is why the children are here. We want them to enjoy sport.”And Pat has the backing of some big names from his former manager Alex Ferguson and team mates Roy Keane and Roy Carroll.Police probe arson attack and suspected gas leak in Craigavon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Former Manchester United goalkeeper and Wigan Athletic player, Roy Carroll popped into Centrepoint in Lurgan on Thursday to help train some of the pupils.And he was very impressed, spotting potential stars of the future.Former Northern Ireland player Roy is fully behind Pat’s bid for a Train B Smart Hub in Craigavon.He said: “Pat and I used to play football together at Wigan Athletic. I came home about three years ago and Pat asked me to come up and help out and it is always a pleasure to come and work with him again.“I just came here today to give the kids a bit of training.

clearly nervous, out-shone her three fellow contestants and scooped £k for the team.Single-mum Libby appeared on the popular show last Friday - a secret she had kept from her colleagues at The Asburn Hotel.“I was shaking like a leaf on the show,” she said.But Libby held her own against The Chaser - Jenny ‘The Vixen’ Ryan - even though the contestant who went before her was ousted. And she scooped a fantastic £, for the pot.Libby, who has had her eye on taking part in The Chase for many years, described the show’s host, comedian Bradley Walsh as ‘so charming and funny’.Even though he nearly got her into hot water with The Ashburn’s chef Micky McLaughlin.Laughing she said Bradley had asked her on the showMicky was like Gordon Ramsay.“There was a lot said about Micky on the show but some of it was cut out,” she revealed.The show was filmed last October and Libby said it was hard to keep it from her workmates.Her daughter Chloe, who works part time as floor staff in the restaurant, knew about it but was sworn to secrecy.“I thought I had to pre-warn chef Micky as he was mentioned on the show but didn’t tell him how I got on,” said the Kilwilkie woman.A former pupil at Tannaghmore PS and St Mary’s Junior High School, Libby puts down her ability for quizzes to her avid book reading.The Royal visit to Northern Ireland continued as the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited Brownlow House, Lurgan Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"She watches quiz shows regularly and takes part in a lot of radio quizzes.She told Bradley Walsh thatshe won the money she would renovate a spare room into a library for all her books and as a craft room for her crochet hobby.Asked why she had applied for the show, she said: “It was on my bucket list. I always wanted to go on a quiz show. Then I hit  and hadn’t done it and then I did  and I was determined to do it.“I applied and went for an audition in Belfast and got on the show,” she said.And she isn’t stopping there with plans afoot to hopefully take part in The Tipping Point.She has plenty more things on her bucket list to achieve including a bungee jump and sky ing, plus a trip to Australia to see her three nieces.Though he didn’t appear on The Chase, Lurgan chef Micky McLaughlin is now known by the millions who watch the show.The -year-old chef said: “We are all very proud of her. The rest of the team did nothing. She was the one who got the £, cashbuilder.”Paul McConaghy, owner of The Ashburn Hotel, said everyone was ‘very proud of her’.“She was unreal.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions. Our customers value our expertise and the ability to meet up in person to discuss financial plans.  What makes your business stand out from the competition  There are numerous competitors in the marketplace, but we are the biggest private banking relationship management team in Northern Ireland. Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged. EE is bringing the connectivity to the city from May , alongside London, Edinburgh, Cardf, Birmingham and Manchester. While still at an early phase, with further roll-out a longer term project, EE says it expects customers in Belfast to “experience an increase in speeds of around -Mbps even in the busiest areas”. “Some customers will break the one gigabit-per-second milestone on their G smartphones.
