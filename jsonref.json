Bright-yellow stripes are being applied to the pavement at now-familiar two-metre intervals outside the school’s three sets of gates, and over the next few days, these markers will appear in classrooms, too. In between, dedicated routes will be laid out to take children safely from the school gates to their classroom doors.These plans, orchestrated by Bonneville’s headteacher, Andrea Parker, were being rolled out as the school prepared to reopen its doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in line with the latest government guidelines. Schools, colleges and nurseries across England welcomed more children and students from 1 June onwards – and headteachers like Parker are busy preparing to embrace a new way of learning.“For every headteacher, keeping children safe is going to be at the top of their priorities”, says Parker, who is also the lead headteacher for Jessop primary and Stockwell primary schools. “We began our preparations by sending out a survey to check the pulse of how teachers and parents were feeling about returning to school. From there, we were able to start modelling what we need to do to support our families, and help them to feel more confident in sending their children back.”Since lockdown, the school has continued to take in around 25 of its 420 pupils each day, split into smaller groups for safety – the children of key workers, those from vulnerable families, or with education, health and care plans in place. “We’ve been open every day during lockdown,” says Parker. “Staff members even volunteered to work through the holidays, which has been fantastic.”Meanwhile, those teachers who have remained at home have been working on providing the online resources parents need for home schooling. “Overnight, we’ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis with no training and no transition period, and teachers have been working incredibly hard to achieve that,” she says.At the same time, Parker believes temporary home schooling can’t replace the benefits of schools-based education, especially when it comes to the transitions experienced by those children who will begin returning to school from 1 June.“Reception, year 1 and year 6 are all key milestones,” she says. “Younger children are in the early stages of their education, and we want to be there for them as they develop their reading and friendship groups, and simply learn how to learn.“At the other end of the spectrum, year 6 are about to go to secondary school. It’s a time when they celebrate their SATs and everything they’ve achieved and worked hard for.”The Bonneville school building, which dates back to 1905, is large and welcoming. When I visit, days before reopening, crafted cardboard models of sea animals hang from the ceilings, and children’s work covers every inch of spare space on the walls.With only a fraction of the school’s 420 pupils in attendance – including Parker’s own six-year-old daughter, who is in school as the child of a key worker – the sound of children’s laughter, which usually fills these hallways, can only faintly be heard drifting in from the playground.“Our teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,” she says. “They’re anxious, too, but going through our risk assessments with them has helped a lot.“With fewer children coming back to start with, we don’t need everybody to be here, which means those who are very anxious can be asked to come back later on. Hopefully they’ll see how things are working and their confidence will build – some people just need that, much like the parents who need to have a choice.”Home schooling for those children who remain at home will continue to be supported by teachers, but to reassure those who do send their children in, a raft of safety measures has been put in place.At the school gates, parents are required to socially distance from each other (guided by those painted stripes) during staggered drop-offs. “Bubbles” of up to 15 children will be dropped off together, with an allocated “bubble lead” – the class teacher – taking students into the building in shifts.Before entering their classroom, they sanitise their hands before being allocated a desk each for taking lessons, watching pre-recorded assemblies, and eating lunch, which will be delivered at the door. Outside space will be utilised for lessons as much as possible, while playtime and PE will be enjoyed within the children’s inidual groups.“Although younger children will be in smaller groups, it’s not just about the size of each bubble – it’s about dynamics as well,” says Parker. “Children are people with their own personalities and their own way of being, so we have to make sure each one is a manageable group and dynamic.”Extra hygiene measures include specific play and sports equipment allocated to each bubble, regular handwashing, staggered bathroom breaks followed by janitor cleaning, and early closing on Friday afternoons for deep-cleaning sessions. The early Friday closure will also be used to facilitate statutory planning and preparation time for teachers. The school has also drawn up sets of principles that parents, teachers and children will be asked to adhere to.For staff, these include having an awareness of each other – for example, no more than two teachers in the staffroom at a time. For children, the principles include reinforcing the NHS’s Catch it, Bin it, Kill it messaging. For parents, coming to collect children as quickly as possible if they fall ill.Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the erse community the school serves. “In terms of the country Lambeth is hugely erse”, says Parker, citing the borough’s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds.“We know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection”, says Parker, explaining that the school’s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind.Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum.Parker’s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. “It’s about trying to adapt, even though we don’t know how long we’re going to be adapting for,” she says.Check with your Local Authority for the latest news on schools opening in your area.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

More than 40,000 redundancies have already been announced across these sectors, with more than 10,000 likely to be in the UK.Rolls-RoyceThe jet-engine manufacturer has confirmed that\u0026nbsp3,000 job cuts, of a planned 9,000 worldwide, will be made in the UK. Rolls-Royce will make the first round of redundancies through a voluntary programme, with about 1,500 posts being lost at its headquarters in Derby, as well as 700 redundancies in Inchinnan, near\u0026nbspGlasgow, another 200 at its Barnoldswick site in Lancashire, and 175 in Solihull, Warwickshire.BentleyThe luxury carmaker intends to\u0026nbspshrink its workforce by almost a quarter, slashing 1,000 roles through a voluntary redundancy scheme. The majority of Bentley’s 4,200 workers are based in Crewe in Cheshire.BPThe oil company plans to make\u0026nbsp10,000 people redundant worldwide, including an estimated 2,000 in the UK, by the end of the year. The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, said that the majority of people affected would be those in office-based jobs, including at the most senior levels. BP said it would reduce the number of group leaders by a third, and protect the “frontline” of the company, in its operations.British AirwaysThe UK flag carrier is holding consultations to\u0026nbspmake up to 12,000 of its staff redundant, a reduction of one in four jobs at the airline. BA intends to cut roles among its cabin crew, pilots and ground staff, while significantly reducing its operations at Gatwick airport.Virgin Atlantic Richard Branson’s airline is to\u0026nbspcut\u0026nbspmore than 3,000 jobs, more than a third of its workforce, and will shut its operations at Gatwick.RyanairThe Irish airline intends to slash 3,000 roles and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth.P\u0026ampO FerriesThe shipping firm intends to cut more than a quarter of its workforce,\u0026nbspa loss of 1,100 jobs. The company, which operates passenger ferries between Dover and Calais, and across the Irish Sea, as well as Hull to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge, will initially offer employees voluntary redundancy.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said the government’s roadmap “sets out our ambition to reopen open pubs, bars and cafes as soon as possible but the date in the roadmap is from 4 July, subject to advice at the time.”However, ministers have been examining changes to regulations, such as those governing which businesses can put chairs and tables out on pavements. Relaxing these rules could make it easier for more outlets to provide the takeaway services permitted throughout the lockdown.Proposals to allow beer gardens to open from 22 June were first reported on Sunday night in the Financial Times, which cited three Whitehall officials.But the  understands that the pubs industry was not told of any such plan and has since informed the government that most pubs would not be ready within a fortnight anyway due to the length of time it takes to brew beer to supply the pubs, as well as the complexity of bringing staff back to work, arranging deep cleans and getting rid of out-of-date beer.Beer that has gone off has to be thrown away but this often involves discussions with local water boards, while the process has to be recorded to verify the amount being disposed of, so that pubs can claim the right amount of beer duty back from brewers.The decision on reopening pubs is further complicated by rules on social distancing.No 10 is understood to have told senior figures in the hospitality industry that cutting social distancing requirements from 2 metres to 1m would be discussed at Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, amid concern about job losses in the hospitality industry.Trade bodies such as UK Hospitality and the British Beer \u0026amp Pubs Association (BBPA) have submitted estimates showing escalating numbers of closures and job losses based on social distancing at 1m, 1.5m and 2m.If the required distance is not reduced, so-called “wet-led” pubs, which rely more on the sale of alcohol than food, are likely to be particularly hard hit, because they rely on packing in drinkers in large numbers.The BBPA has also voiced concern at the prospect that pubs could lose access to the furlough scheme and grant support if they are technically allowed to open, even though the reality of social distancing rules means many cannot.The trade body wants the government to provide financial backing to any pubs that are rendered unviable as a result.If ministers agree to provide that support, maintaining social distancing at 2m would mean many more pubs, bars and restaurants would draw on the funding, increasing the cost to the Treasury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a734fbb19b5812abf91943bdee05da0ce939339f/0_178_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3aab6e3809efed2ec279f5e75315cfc1","title":"great britain coal free industrial revolution electricity","story":"England, Scotland and Wales on brink of two-month milestone, longest period since 1880s, says National GridGreat Britain will on Wednesday be able to celebrate not having used any coal-powered electricity for two months – the longest period since the 1880s.Great Britain, which introduced coal-powered electricity to the world in the 1880s, has run its electricity network without using any coal power since midnight on 9 April, according to the National Grid.“The exact two-month mark is midnight tonight (00:00 on Wednesday 10 June), which will mark 61 days (or 1,464 hours) since the last coal generator came off the system,” a spokesman for National Grid’s Electricity System Operator said.The coal-free period beats the previous record of 18 days, six hours and 10 minutes set in June 2019. The figures apply to Great Britain – England, Wales and Scotland – only, as Northern Ireland is not on the National Grid.Low power prices caused by reduced industrial demand, because of the lockdown and levies on carbon emissions, has made it increasingly unprofitable to run coal-fired power stations.Great Britain hopes to close all coal plants by 2024 as part of efforts to reach the government’s net zero emissions goal by 2050.Use of renewable power, such as wind and solar, has soared during the lockdown as it often has lower running costs than gas and coal plants and there have been favourable weather conditions.May was the greenest-ever month for electricity production, with the lowest average carbon intensity on record at 143 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour, National Grid said. Carbon intensity is a measure of how much carbon dioxide is emitted for each kilowatt hour of electricity produced.Renewable energy use has also overtaken coal in the US for the first time in more than 130 years. The US government said renewables overtook coal as the primary energy source in 2019.

There are around 10m micro and sole traders in the UK.It is not clear how many firms are still waiting to open new accounts in order to access BBLS, since the government figures only cover formal applications for each scheme.The largest of the three main schemes, known as CLBILS, has had a much lower take up. The programme, which is also the least generous, has approved 244 of the 615 applications, with loans now totalling around £1.6bn.Attention is now turning to repayment plans, over fears that many small firms will struggle to service growing debts over the coming months. A City taskforce\u0026nbsphas projected that small and medium-sized businesses will be faced with £97bn to £107bn of unsustainable debt by March 2021. A third of that total will come from government-backed loans.The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking (APPG) is calling on banks and financial regulators to introduce six-month payment and interest holidays for business loans and commercial mortgages outside of the government scheme.The APPG said most payment holidays did not cover interest payments and any forbearance was only available on request. “Lenders should step up support and proactively offer full payment holidays, ie interest as well as capital, to impacted business customers,” the APPG said.The City taskforce, led by EY and financial sector lobby group TheCityUK, is exploring a range of solutions to deal with growing debt piles on both standard and government-backed loans. Potential measures, which are now being reviewed by groups including the Treasury and Bank of England, include turning debt into equity or a profit tax, or introducing debt repayment holidays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2768350948892a226984514817acc4e780183a6b/0_744_4323_2596/master/4323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=365879e5e382530e7039ba59fd23c0bf","title":"british people coronavirus lockdown","story":"This endless semi-lockdown will put more lives at risk and make countless others miserableBritain is trapped in lockdown purgatory. In Liverpool, where I live, we are back to square one, with an “R” rate estimated to be hovering at or just over 1. That means the vast majority of people have been staying indoors, not sending their children to school, or seeing their friends and family for nearly three months, only to find that coronavirus, and the risk of transmitting it to others, is still in circulation. Now what?Our household of four – two home-working adults, two primary-school age children – is augmented in normal times by many regular visitors. I know from my own early experiences that nuclear families contain pressures and unspoken traumas that can only be relieved by constant engagement\u0026nbspwith the outside world, but the March lockdown enforced that rigid nuclear model almost without warning.We’ve stayed in our bubble, believing it to be temporary, and were doing all right in lockdown for a good eight weeks, blessed with good weather and a decent back yard, in spite of a troubling suspicion that Zoom calls might come to be regarded as satisfactory replacements for real-world relationships. At times the lockdown has only seemed possible to endure because our household has the resources to make it tolerable.Then the government’s message changed, to the effect that it was the responsibility of inidual households not only to maintain social relationships virtually, to educate children and to keep the economy running, but also to “control the virus”. I started to wonder whether there was a method – however buried, however unconscious – in this. After all, who needs society – and its attendant systems of social support – when you’ve got nuclear families and stoic iniduals?\u0026nbspCommon action depends on social life. Whenever people are ordered to retreat from physical society it’s necessary to ask for whom, and for what purpose, they are doing it. At the start the answer was clear: it was for each other, and it was for the NHS. But, then, the hospitals – in most cases – weren’t overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients. Intensive care units, for the most part, were never full. A\u0026ampE departments emptied overnight, and the Nightingale hospitals were almost never used.It became clear over April and May that thousands of people were dying during this crisis from\u0026nbspcauses other than coronavirus.\u0026nbspTo give an example, 10,000 more people with dementia have died than would normally die in the same time period, over and above those with dementia who are known have died with Covid-19. They may have died because, to put it bluntly,\u0026nbspan attempt to prioritise the quantity of their lives over the quality has disastrously backfired.\u0026nbspMy dad, 75 this week, has dementia, and moved into a care home near my house last year. His home is one of a handful in Liverpool that has had no infections so far and, understandably, its staff want to keep it that way. But he’s getting more confused. He hasn’t been outside the home since 22 March. Since my visits have been limited to a quick wave from the porch when I drop off his Guinness and crisps, he\u0026nbspspends most of the day asleep and is gradually losing any sense of time and its significance.For how much longer can we be said to be protecting the elderly – and all vulnerable people – during the pandemic while making so little provision for them to be included in society?\u0026nbspBoth the government and its scientific advisers know that reducing infections in care homes is necessary to prevent a second wave. But what we know is that, throughout the pandemic, the Tories have been consumed with treating a public health crisis as an exercise in political management, resulting in a social and economic crisis of a scale that it shows little interest in acknowledging, let alone addressing.\u0026nbspThe government’s\u0026nbspsolution\u0026nbspto isolation and unemployment is to re-open garden centres, “non-essential” shops and beer gardens. There have been no major media splashes on re-opening libraries, swimming pools and public toilets, nor government attempts to find – or fund – ways for schools to recommence lessons using outdoor spaces, or for care homes to allow physical visitors.\u0026nbspThe best we have to show for 40 years of “baseline economic growth”, it seems, is a pathological aversion to the civic sphere.The result is a lockdown twilight zone, where public life and private spirits continue to wither while the idea of being able to go to Next in a car is presented as a return to the kind of normality most people have said they don’t even want. In other words, it’s the worst of both worlds, offering neither the certainty of “stay at home, save lives” nor the messy reality of everyday public life. It underscores and contributes to inequalities that already exist and bends us towards a society based on turning inwards rather than outwards.In such circumstances, where people from black and ethnic minority groups have a vastly higher mortality risk from Covid-19, it’s galvanising and heartening to see Black Lives Matter protests taking place at a time when we are being told to stay in, indefinitely, unless we have a risky job to go to or have an overwhelming urge to buy some compost.\u0026nbspProtesters have one clear message: we refuse to live like this, and we refuse to die like this.\u0026nbspThe coronavirus crisis has widened to expose the effects of social marginality and inequality, and the ways in which race and class work in tandem to compound disadvantage in multiple and lethal forms. Had it taken the pandemic and its repercussions seriously in the first place, the government could have avoided stumbling into an endless semi-lockdown that will put more lives at risk and make countless others miserable.\u0026nbsp• Lynsey Hanley is the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b36e4941ecf4df2378e102a38b5866e4d688b425/98_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7ec13dab5853f66155b992e6efa77292","title":"majority of uk theatres and music venues face permanent shutdown","story":"MPs told future is grim unless government steps in with more support after Covid-19 crisisHorace Trubridge, the general secretary of the Musicians’ Union, and Julian Bird, chief executive of UK Theatre and Society of London Theatre, painted a grim picture of the plight of swathes of the UK creative industry as the coronavirus keeps doors shuttered and venues struggling to stay afloat financially.People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.“We never ever imagined that something like this, so catastrophic could come along that would kill live music for a period of time,” said Trubridge, speaking at a virtual session of the House of Commons culture select committee of MPs looking at the impact of Covid-19 on the creative industries.“A lot of music venues are in city centres in sort of prime real estate. If they can’t continue to make the money that keeps the doors open then I think their landlords will be thinking about doing something else with the properties. We could very easily lose half the music venues we have in the UK during this crisis if there isn’t more permanent support for them.”The Music Venue Trust, which has campaigned for years to save grassroots music venues, says it has 800 members.Bird cited the example of the Birmingham Hippodrome – the home stage of the Birmingham Royal Ballet and venue for touring West End shows such as Wicked and We Will Rock You – which on Monday said that 60 of its 130 full-time staff face redundancy with the venue set to stay closed until October.Both men called on the UK government for additional support for the creative industries, citing examples such as Germany’s €1bn (£890m) cultural fund, as venues struggle and tens of thousands of workers failed to qualify for support schemes.\u0026nbspAsked about implementing physical distancing rules when venues are allowed to reopen, both men said they could not see how it would be economically viable for venues, even if a 1-metre rule replaced the 2 metres currently required. “That is not an economic business model most venues can operate on realistically going forward,” said Bird."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18fd609aae988e476a65612c97fb0ac3204379f/0_351_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e57941bd78d4565c295dc7e3653240ad","title":"yellowstone grizzly bear 399 conservation","story":"‘399’, at 24 one of the oldest grizzlies living outside a zoo, becomes symbol of bears’ recovery in Yellowstone ecosystemA few weeks ago, a nature photographer who lives near Yellowstone national park sent a four-word text message to Dr Jane Goodall, the British primatologist.“Miraculously, she still lives!”The photographer, Thomas Mangelsen, was referring to a grizzly bear known as “399”, probably the most famous wild bruin in the world. Aged 24, not only is she one of the oldest grizzlies living outside a zoo, she has also continued having cubs to a venerable age, becoming a poster child for the recovery of bears in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem.And no grizzly has done more, through her own behavior, to change a perception that members of her species are temperamental menaces ready to attack people at the slightest provocation.In mid-May, the 350lb grand dame emerged in Grand Teton national park, striding alongside Pilgrim Creek. Trailing close behind the matriarch were four cubs, born this winter in a wilderness den high in the snowy backcountry.\u0026nbspMangelsen has been chronicling the life and times of 399 for nearly 15 years.\u0026nbspGoodall counts herself among the bear’s most ardent admirers, and, holed up in England, was eagerly awaiting word on whether 399 had survived the long winter.\u0026nbspMangelsen said she was ecstatic.The population of grizzlies in the Yellowstone region was given protection under the Endangered Species Act in 1975 after their numbers dipped to less than 150, and scientists feared they could disappear altogether. But their recovery, thanks to habitat protection, crackdowns on poaching and a ban on hunting, is considered one of the greatest conservation triumphs in US history.\u0026nbspToday, at least\u0026nbsp700 grizzlies inhabit the region and, luring tourists, they have paid tangible economic idends.Born in 1996, 399 has demonstrated the importance of a healthy female bear to an overall population. At least 22 bears are descended from her, both cubs and cubs of cubs (in human terms, grandchildren).\u0026nbspIt’s possible she could become a great grandmother – a senior citizen who is still having offspring of her own.Generally pacific in nature, 399 has raised her broods by roadsides in view of groups of curious humans, including some who have exercised poor judgment by moving closer to take photographs of her and her cubs. She has, with one exception, demonstrated incredible restraint.In 2007, she mauled a Wyoming schoolteacher after he strolled by a spot where 399 and three cubs were feeding on an elk carcass in the bushes.\u0026nbspThe teacher survived, and the park superintendent determined that the mother was only behaving naturally, acting in defense of the cubs and their meal.Yet researchers note that it’s not easy being a young grizzly, even with a keen parent like 399.\u0026nbspAbout\u0026nbsphalf\u0026nbspof those in 399’s bloodline have died. One was shot by a big-game hunter, another was killed for preying upon cattle, and a few have been struck by cars.\u0026nbspThe drama has played out in front of legions of human onlookers who, in turn, have circulated details on social media as if 399 were the star of a soap opera.The oldest grizzly in the Yellowstone region documented with cubs was 27. Mangelsen had a hunch that 399 would emerge this year with more of her own. During the summer of 2019 she was seen in the company of a regular suitor, a huge 600lb male nicknamed Bruno who is believed to have sired some of 399’s earlier infants. Mangelsen and other observers were not disappointed.“Four-cub litters are rare,” said Frank van Manen, a senior research biologist who oversees the Yellowstone region’s\u0026nbspGrizzly Bear Study Team. “We have documented females producing cubs well into their early- to mid- 20s, but a litter of four at that age is definitely unique.”Most visitors come to Yellowstone hoping to catch a glimpse of bears. \u0026nbspThere is a heated public debate about whether sport hunting of bears should again be allowed in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, where the Greater Yellowstone population lives. That question, along with the possible removal of endangered species protections, is tied up in the courts.To manage the throngs of bear watchers, Grand Teton national park, next door to Yellowstone, has\u0026nbspmobilized its “bear brigade”. Apart from trying to keep safe distances between bears and tourists, it has an added coronavirus-era task of doing the same between people. Last week, it was not uncommon to see people trading information about the whereabouts of 399 through open car windows.For Steve Franklin, a retired firefighter and arson investigator from Phoenix, 399 possesses a particular mystique. Franklin told the  that he had just made his own contribution to the lore of this celebrity bear, having spotted her before anyone else.“I dreamed of being the person who sees her first in the spring and gets the photo,” Franklin said. “Everyone who knows the legacy of 399 wants to be that person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d44cdaa49b6f2bfd62bbd3ebca1a2efdd4e7c20e/0_169_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=fbb2e0b25c3c4d4366b01da1d5052b51","title":"whats the secret to great jollof rice kitchen aide","story":"This beloved West African rice dish has long kicked up lively debate, so we asked the experts• Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theI love jollof rice, but never get it quite right at home. What’s the secret?Beth, Cobham, SurreyThis seemingly simple question is a loaded one – the beloved West African staple has caused diplomatic incidents (Nigeria’s culture minister was accused of betraying his country’s cuisine in 2017 after reportedly saying Senegal’s was the best jollof) and famously got Jamie Oliver into hot water when he added coriander, parsley and lemon to the traditional orange-red mix (#JollofGate). So, into the trenches we go…The principle of jollof, says Zoe Adjonyoh, founder of Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, is “it’s a red sauce with onion and heat”. It’s what you do after this – the vegetables (carrots and peas are popular), rice, liquid, meat and the cooking method – that’s the subject of dispute in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cameroon and beyond. “Every household has a different way of cooking it,” Adjonyoh explains.What can be agreed on, however, is that time is essential. “Like most West African food, you can’t rush it,” says chef Maria Bradford, who grew up in Sierra Leone. “You want to caramelise the onions slowly in coconut oil, before adding tomatoes, spices, herbs, ginger, garlic, scotch bonnet, white cabbage and, finally, stock.”Adjonyoh agrees: “The secret is in how much love and attention you give the sauce.” That’s what flavours the dish, after all. She blends tomatoes, onion, scotch bonnet, tomato puree, dried chilli and salt, and makes a spice mix of ground ginger and coriander, onion powder, garlic powder, smoked crayfish powder, smoked prawn powder, dawadawa (fermented locust bean), nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, salt and, sometimes, brown sugar. It’s a long list, yes, but, as Adjonyoh explains, “in Ghana, jollof is more aromatic”. Add a tablespoon of the spice mix to caramelised onions, along with chilli powder, madras hot curry powder, fresh ginger and garlic, then the tomatoes and good chicken stock, and cook until it “doesn’t taste of tomato any more, but just the spices”.Adjonyoh washes her rice three times, then works to a 1:2 rice-to-liquid ratio: “You want the tomato base to make up two-thirds of that ‘liquid’, and you add it only once the rice is boiling in the remaining third of water, to open up the grain.” Pop on a lid, then, once two-thirds of the liquid has been absorbed, turn off the heat and leave to finish cooking in its steam.The rice used is also a bone of contention. Adjonyoh favours long-grain, while chef Fafa Gilbert goes for jasmine (for its “scent and sweet flavour”) or basmati Lope Ariyo, author of Hibiscus, flits between the latter and long-grain, which she parboils before finishing off in 1:1½ rice-to-liquid. Emeka Frederick, half of the duo behind Nigerian tapas joint Chuku’s, uses brown rice at home and quinoa in the restaurant: “It has the right flavour profile, but in a lighter form.” Not to mention none of the preconceptions.\u0026nbspTraditionally, jollof is made over fire, so to emulate that smokiness, Gilbert recommends slightly charring the bottom, before upping the ante with smoked paprika, as well as thyme, rosemary and nutmeg. And, because extra fat is always a good idea, she finishes her jollof with butter or coconut oil, and serves it with grilled chicken, fried plantain and avocado.Ultimately, that’s the joy of jollof: you do you, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. “What I love is that everybody cooks it in their own way,” Frederick says. “Forget jollof wars and follow your tastebuds – but do add a kick of fresh ginger.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

We’re talking about romance of the fußball variety. On Tuesday night, FC Saarbrücken\u0026nbsphave the chance to become the first fourth-tier team to ever reach the German Cup final. So far, so feelgood. There are a couple of catches, though. The first is that they have to beat an excellent Bayer Leverkusen side the second is that they will be playing their first game in more than three months, so their match fitness could leave a soupçon to be desired.The Regionalliga Südwest ended early because of Covid-19, with Saarbrücken winning the title – and promotion – on points per game. Their last match was a 1-0 defeat against Astoria Walldorf on 7 March, back in the days when we were all OK to shake hands and make out with trolley handles. While Leverkusen have had five Bundesliga games since their own spring break, Saarbrücken have had to make do with 11 v 11s in training. Even the traditional advantage of playing at home might not be in Saarbrücken’s favour, given the recent spurt of away wins in the Bundesliga. The game will be played behind closed doors, and there have even been some chilling rumours that it will take place without a virtual crowd.The lack of real attendees really is sad, as this was supposed to be a celebration of a cup run that is already career-defining for many of Saarbrücken’s players. They have put out two Bundesliga sides, Köln and Fortuna Düsseldorf, as well as Karlsruhe and Jahn Regensburg from the second tier. It’s a charming story, even if the lack of data on average positions in Regionalliga Südwest has made it exasperatingly difficult for The Fiver to determine whether Saarbrücken play a 4-4-2 or a 4-4-1-1. Two of the victories came from last-minute goals – and they were the easy ones. The others came via penalty shoot-outs, most recently against Düsseldorf in the quarter-final.The winner of this game will play either Bayern Munich or Bayern Munich in the final, so it feels like a second-placed play-off. There is some good news for Saarbrücken, mind: they’re not as pathologically negative as The Fiver, for a start, and THEY’RE IN THE BLOODY GERMAN BLOODY CUP SEMI-BLOODY-FINAL. Leverkusen will also without\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspKai Havertz, who is knacked. And Saarbrücken have already landed four beauties on Goliath’s confused noggin, so why not a fifth?

There was the 80s hit machine, a trio whose sound existed somewhere between soul and shiny synth-pop, authors of the ubiquitous I’m So Excited and Jump (For My Love). And there was the Pointer Sisters that existed before them, when Bonnie Pointer was still a member, who were a very different and far more intriguing proposition: a quartet, dressed in a chaotic, charity-shop approximation of 1940s glamour, whose sound zigzagged wittily and unpredictably between jazz, soul, blues and country.They could make music that matched their outfits, sounding like an African-American equivalent of the Manhattan Transfer, or of Bette Midler belting out The Lullaby of Broadway and Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy to the delight of the patrons of New York’s Continental Baths. Alternatively, they could turn out a tough take on Willie Dixon’s Wang Dang Doodle or the humid New Orleans funk of Allen Toussaint’s Yes We Can Can. They could do disco, as on 1977’s Waiting on You equally, they could win a Grammy for the best country performance by a duo or group, as they did for Fairytale (1974). They had hits, but they were nowhere near as commercially successful as their latter incarnation, perhaps because the 70s version of the Pointer Sisters kept wrongfooting their audience, or rather their audiences: there may have been some crossover between the crowd who bought tickets to see the post-blaxploitation comedy Car Wash – in which they appeared serenading Richard Prior’s corrupt evangelist Daddy Rich – and those who turned up to see them play Nashville’s Grand Ol’ Opry, the first black vocal group ever to do so, but it doesn’t seem terribly likely.It was Bonnie Pointer who formed the band, initially as a duo with youngest sister June, before elder siblings Anita and Ruth joined. They worked as backing vocalists for an eclectic range of San Francisco-based artists – Boz Scaggs, Sylvester, Jefferson Airplane’s Grace Slick – and recorded a couple of singles for Atlantic: Don’t Try to Take the Fifth and Destination No More Heartaches. The A-sides were solid if unremarkable examples of early-70s soul, but the B-side of the latter, Send Him Back, had a distinctly retro flavour that meant it was eventually rediscovered by northern soul DJs.But it wasn’t until they signed to Blue Thumb that the Pointer Sisters came into their own. It was an impressively eclectic label – its roster included Captain Beefheart and Sun Ra, and it gamely attempted to interest America in the Pointer Sisters’ former employer, Sylvester and the Hot Band, audiences proving resistant to the idea of an androgynous black man belting out Neil Young’s Southern Man in high heels – and the Pointer Sisters’ stylistic rethink made them fit right in.The 40s affectations were surprisingly timely – fashion was undergoing a retro moment that found its expression everywhere from women’s platform shoes and halter dresses to the GI look sported by Bryan Ferry – and their stage show was campily theatrical enough that San Francisco’s Opera House, previously closed to pop artists, hosted a performance by them (captured on a 1974 live album). Both their eponymous debut, which featured backing from another Blue Thumb act, the blues-rockers Hoodoo Rhythm Devils, and its follow-up, That’s A-Plenty, went gold in the US.But even Blue Thumb seemed startled when Anita and Bonnie wrote Fairytale, a song inspired in equal part by Jackson Browne and the country songs they remembered being sung by their older relatives, who had moved from Arkansas to California. Blue Thumb lacked a country department to promote it, so handed it over to their sister label, Dot. It made the country charts, won a Grammy and was subsequently covered by Elvis Presley.The band toyed with making a country album, but instead recorded Steppin’ – home to both a medley of Duke Ellington songs and How Long (Betcha Gotta Chick on the Side), a superb funk track again co-written by Anita and Bonnie that became another hit. On the surface, Having a Party (1977) appeared more straightforward, dialling down the swing-era influences, but was still both witty – “Take off your socks, I don’t wanna see no socks, baby” protested the fabulously slinky Don’t It Drive You Crazy – and musically varied: disco next to old Sam Cooke covers and the reggae-inspired I’ll Get By Without You.The following year, Bonnie Pointer married Temptations and Chairmen of the Board producer Jeffrey Bowen and was spirited away for a solo career on Motown, under his aegis. The Pointer Sisters were never the same again, although you could occasionally detect a hint of their old eclecticism – they had a hit with the Bruce Springsteen song, Fire, and there was definitely a country song lurking somewhere beneath the production gloss of their 1981 ballad Slow Hand.Motown, meanwhile, appeared slightly at a loss as to what to do with Bonnie Pointer. The big idea on her two albums for the label seemed to be getting her to record disco versions of the label’s vintage hits – Jimmy Mack, Nowhere to Run (Nowhere to Hide) – with Pointer multitracking the vocal harmonies. It was an approach that yielded a solo hit with an updated version of the Elgins’ Heaven Must Have Sent You, but it gave them a whiff of novelty and meant the fresh material she performed was overshadowed. The best track on either album was Free Me from My Freedom, mid-tempo disco complete with an unlikely banjo solo, that was given a particularly fantastic extended 12-inch version, but it failed to cross over from the clubs to the chart. Radio programmers were apparently put off by the lyrics’ vague undercurrent of S\u0026ampM.Pointer fell into contractual dispute with Motown and didn’t release another album for five years: the sense that If the Price Is Right (1984) was an attempt to mimic the style that had brought her sisters multi-platinum success was hard to escape, although she remained a live draw for the rest of her life, performing in Vegas and Atlantic City and sporadically reuniting with her sisters on stage. Her final album, Like a Picasso (2011), had its moments – the single Strangest Day was an impressively raw rock-soul hybrid, decorated with bluesy harmonica. But her reputation rests on the music she made in the 70s, particularly with the Pointer Sisters, back when you never quite knew what the Pointer Sisters would do next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af71fa4482c39fdd6cf37c1cf4c61a52bc508b3/29_35_639_383/master/639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3486e58c0adf5b5693144ac113a89854","title":"hyeyoon park benjamin grosvenor review wigmore hall bbc radio 3","story":"Wigmore HallBBC Radio 3Both violin and piano showed a vast range of colours and textures in this lunchtime recital that included Franck and a memorable Schumann encoreThere is a point in the high-energy third movement (Dryads and Pan) of Szymanowski’s Mythes Op 30 for violin and piano when there’s a sudden change of gear: the piece’s manic prancing temporarily abates and the violinist plays alone, using only harmonics. It’s one of the strangest, most haunting sounds a string instrument can make. That passage and the re-entry of the piano that follows were one of several spine-tingling moments in violinist Hyeyoon Park’s Wigmore Hall lunchtime recital with her partner and regular collaborator, pianist Benjamin Grosvenor.\u0026nbspNo empty hall could sound more still than it did as Park and Grosvenor spun Szymanowski’s gossamer musical fabric in that third movement. Such impressionistic music depends hugely on the quality of its surface and in this performance it was practically flawless. Grosvenor’s touch was astonishingly responsive – as supple in quiet, single-handed lyricism as in flurries of quicksilver virtuosity – while Park made stylish use throughout of portamento and her irrepressibly expressive vibrato.César Franck’s Violin Sonata – the second half of the programme – was a simultaneous showcase of Park’s huge palette of tone colours and of Grosvenor’s ability to conjure clarity from the densest of textures. This is a big-boned, unabashedly Romantic work where opportunities for a lighter touch are rare. Grosvenor’s hold-your-breath pianissimos weren’t always matched by Park, but her unaccompanied passages in the recitative-fantasia movement had all the poise of solo Bach (albeit on a Parisian opium trip).Most memorable in the end, though, was the encore. After so much impassioned virtuosity, Schumann’s Abendlied Op 85 No 12 appeared stark in its simplicity. Yet it was here that Park and Grosvenor’s musical partnership achieved its most touching intimacy.• Available to listen on\u0026nbspBBC Sounds\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspwatch via Wigmore Hall Live Stream.

That can be quite a difficult place when you’re not supported.”The coalition, which formed over WhatsApp, has called for the implementation of specific career development programmes for black staff to advance future generations of leaders. It asked for change regarding the lack of black staff in senior management and the complete absence of black female presidents and chairwomen across the industry.The major disparity was with industry “decision makers”, said Afryea Henry-Fontaine, senior marketing manager at Virgin EMI Universal Music Group. “People that control the budgets, decide if an act is going to be signed. That’s where there isn’t ersity at all, at that capital-controlling level.”The coalition called for businesses to create dedicated internal task forces to review, drive and challenge its equality and ersity aims, as well as the advancement of black executives across the business, with a focus on equal pay, mentorship and career progression.The lack of black music industry executives has a negative effect on the UK’s rising black musicians, said Henry-Fontaine. “Things are lost in translation. There’s not a sensitivity to different cultural nuances. Those that are advising them outside of management don’t understand the culture in the way that they should.”Following #BlackoutTuesday, Republic Records, home to Ariana Grande and Drake, pledged to stop using the term “urban” to describe music made by black artists. The coalition’s signatories called for music companies across the board to cease use of the term and replace it with “black music”.“‘Urban’ does often relate to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop –\u0026nbspsub-genres of blackness,” said Whitney Boateng, a promoter at polis Music. “‘Urban’ strips away the actual blackness from the music. Black is not a swear word. To say ‘black music’ doesn’t mean that people who are not black are not included –\u0026nbspit just means that you’re giving credit to the actual genre and its makers and forefathers.”Grant said the term was outdated regarding today’s charts, where black British music is a dominant fixture. “It’s full of artists that have built their brands and their identities through strong fanbases, and they deserve to be on a level playing field with all the other artists at the top of the charts. ‘Urban’ doesn’t support the advancement of people’s understanding of the layers of black music. It contributes to the mentality of: ‘Oh, it’s urban –\u0026nbspyou need to graduate to pop.’ We need to be rid of that.”The coalition asked music companies to commit a portion of their annual budget to offer financial support to black organisations, educational projects and charities. “They need more funding,” said Henry-Fontaine. “That’s not going to come from the government or the National Lottery, and so I think it’s disingenuous for an industry that profits so incredibly well from black culture and black music not to support those projects.”In addition to mandatory anti-racism and unconscious bias training across each company for all non-black members of staff, led by black educators, the coalition asked for complimentary counselling and holistic services to be made available to black members of staff with immediate effect in order to address the effects of workplace racism and global violence against black people.“Black executives have been experiencing men and women that look like them being racially targeted and murdered by an institution that is supposed to serve and protect,” said Henry-Fontaine. “We’re seeing that play out on the news, on social media, in horrific and callous ways, and then we’re expected to go into a work environment and operate as if everything is normal.”Sent to CEOs, presidents and industry leaders on Monday morning , the letter has received a positive response. “This is not going to happen in 24 hours,” said Henry-Fontaine. “This is a longstanding commitment that we’ve made, and it’s about pushing the conversation forward. It’s about assessing that understanding and working with internal teams to make and push forward long-lasting change.”The open letter follows US executives Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas’s #TheShowMustBePaused initiative on 2 June, which called for the music industry to cease activity for a day in order for black participants to take space for their mental health and for allies to reflect on their obligations to black music communities.While the day provoked a mass social media movement beyond the music industry, some musicians and industry employees criticised the blackout for pledging silence at a time when social media had become a key tool for the spread of information between protesters on the ground.Henry-Fontaine said she understood the scepticism, but affirmed the importance of the day. “This is the first time the entire industry has stopped and been so public in their support. The whole purpose is to be in dialogue, to hold companies accountable. These are the first five immediate calls to action. There are many more to come because this is a multifaceted issue. We’re not gonna click our fingers and it’ll all be over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0896836e751358a0ad66bf10af308ec503b1887/0_106_2796_1677/master/2796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ce66eb3493d14868c9cb9ca43871ee0","title":"is british theatre about to go out of business","story":"Every year, 34 million people go to the theatre, double the number that attend Premier League football.

It is clear from our research that this simply isn’t the case – indeed, the system as it stands is not fit for purpose,” King said.“This is the critical moment for the government to act now or risk further spikes. We believe that a new approach is required, one that moves away from a centralised system that utilises a local-first approach.

It was set up partly in response to a lack of transparency around the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The membership of Sage and minutes and documents relating to its meetings have since been published.The independent group’s report points out that the epidemic is still growing in some parts of the country, such as north-west England. They say erosion of trust in the government in recent weeks will make it less likely that people will comply if they are called by contact-tracers and told they must self-isolate.It argues for a more comprehensive system than just test and trace. The report says it should be “find, test, trace, isolate and support”. Speed is vital: the scientists point out that Sage itself advised that the aim should be to isolate as many contacts as possible within 48 hours.Test results should be available within 24 hours, says Independent Sage. Those who are isolated should have financial support and accommodation provided if they need it.

The most tremendous of these bad actors was, of course, Donald Trump, at an Alabama rally the following year when he infamously challenged the league’s owners to release anyone who refused to stand: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’”\u0026nbspRather than back the players’ right to freedom of expression, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell gifted Trump a decisive optical victory early in his administration by unveiling a policy requiring every player, coach, trainer, ballboy, referee and executive to stand for the anthem or face punishment.\u0026nbspFour years later – after the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer choked the life from George Floyd in a gruesome extrajudicial murder that was beamed into living rooms throughout the country, sending hundred of thousands into the streets across America to demand police reform – Kaepernick’s protest appears not merely justified but prescient. On Thursday, more than a dozen of the NFL’s biggest stars including Patrick Mahomes, Saquon Barkley, Michael Thomas and Deshaun Watson, the sorts of in-their-prime stars who might have shied away from social issues in the past, posted a video demanding the NFL state that it condemns systemic racism and “admit wrong in silencing our players from peacefully protesting”. And congressional legislation tackling police reform that would have been dismissed as politically quixotic only weeks ago has planted itself squarely in the national discourse.Ever since he first seized on Kaepernick’s protest as a fountainhead of easy political points, Trump has co-opted American sports as not merely a proxy battle in the culture wars that reflect a country’s deep ides but the primary theatre. He’s returned to the well time and again when the polling numbers have called for a jolt, but the events of the past week have shown that the reservoir has run dry.The horrifying deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery have made it so the public can no longer stand by as Kaepernick’s protest is misrepresented: the reality of the long-marginalized scourge of state-sanctioned murder of black and brown people has finally reached a mass audience. Consider New Orleans Saints star Drew Brees, who issued a public apology after he was blasted by teammates and fans for saying he “will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States”.On Friday, only hours after Trump publicly excoriated Brees for backing down on his long-held stance, Goodell surprised many by releasing the mea culpa his players asked for: “We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,” he said. “We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.”Goodell may have fumbled the handoff that Kaepernick first gave him in 2016, but he wasn’t going to do it twice. And the commissioner’s tacit endorsement has ensured that taking a knee will become the new locking arms – that is to say, an acceptable and thereby meaningless form of protest. Whenever the next NFL season kicks off, kneeling will become another form of pre-game window dressing: just another patriotic thing to do when the anthem plays.But this mainstreaming of ideas once regarded as radical is proof that Kaepernick’s protest, and the sacrifice of his NFL career that came with it, was worth the price.The NFL’s ersity problem is its decision-making ranks has been exhaustively documented, but football itself is the most integrated sport we have in America. It’s not just for black kids, it’s not just for white kids. You can be fat and play on the line. You can be skinny and play wide receiver. You can be a total non-athlete like Tom Brady and win multiple Super Bowls.\u0026nbspWhich made it somewhat depressing that Brees, a 41-year-old who’s spent more than half of his life around black teammates while becoming a symbol of hope for a city that endured one of the worst racial injustices in American history, continued to push a false narrative in conflating a protest of extreme police brutality with disrespect for the military – especially when he’d been given four years to get up to speed.Yet Brees’ thoughtful response to Trump’s broadside, addressed directly to the president, represents the sort of teachable moment that’s bound to reach an audience beyond Kaepernick’s influence and further the movement toward justice.“Through my ongoing conversations with friends, teammates, and leaders in the black community, I realize this is not an issue about the American flag. It has never been,” Brees wrote. “We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities.“We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial \u0026amp prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation’s history! If not now, then when?“We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.”Or as LeBron James put it, in more economical language: “Do you understand NOW!!??!!??”Kaepernick’s movement has inspired a groundswell of athletes beyond the NFL, in a sharp break from the “Republicans buy sneakers too” indifference of the previous generation, to speak on social issues with a frequency and ardor not seen since the high water mark of athlete activism of the 1960s, when champions such as Muhammad Ali, John Carlos and Tommie Smith put it all on the line for the advance of justice.And like those three champions before him, Kaepernick will be remembered as a hero, whether he plays another down in the NFL or not. That’s because the change he effected has shifted global opinion, even if required a second far more tragic knee to bring it to pass. Now the real work begins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f083b3637bba8001d658650998d0027c69aa887/0_191_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34014b9fdd31ef848063bba1bcd8919b","title":"farewell geoffrey boycott a mess of contradictions whose tms innings lasted far too long","story":"Much like his calling to teammates while batting, Geoffrey Boycott’s removal was later than it should have been and his survival at the BBC was to the detriment of othersThe 11th and last time that Geoffrey Boycott ran out his Yorkshire teammate Richard Lumb was in the second innings of a County Championship match against Gloucestershire at Park Avenue in Bradford in 1982. It was the second time Boycott had done it to Lumb in that same match and afterwards Lumb sat in the dressing room with his pads on waiting for his partner to come back in from the middle.When he did, Lumb, usually a quiet man, shouted: “What do you think you’re doing? Twice in the match? That’s 11-0 on run-outs now.” Boycott apologised. “I must be bad at it, what should I do?” he said. “You should piss off,” Lumb told him, “like you should have done 10 years ago.”Seems like people have always been trying to get rid of Boycott, bowled, caught, dropped, sacked, run out, on one famous occasion, by his own England teammates.Last week, Boycott finally went. The BBC announced its roster of cricket commentators for the summer, and he wasn’t on it. He explained that his contract expired last year, and, since he’s 79 and recently had a quadruple heart bypass, the Covid-19 pandemic had taken the decision about whether or not to carry on out of his hands.Being Boycott, he couldn’t help himself but enthusiastically retweet a message sent by one of his fans: “White, male, straight, Tory and knows about cricket. Surprised he lasted this long at the BBC.” “Absolutely right,” Boycott added, though, with one eye on the prospect of coming back as a guest analyst, he later deleted the tweet.Boycott is right, it is a surprise he lasted as long at the BBC as he did. A surprise he lasted 22 years after he was convicted of assaulting Margaret Moore. A surprise he lasted nine years after he appeared to make fun of Michael Yardy’s mental health on air – “He must have been reading my comments about his bowling,” he said when Yardy pulled out of the 2011 World Cup because he was struggling with depression. “I’m sorry he’s not good enough at this level.” And a surprise he lasted three years after he said he should “black me face” to get the knighthood he was so sure he deserved, because the honour was “handed out like confetti” to West Indian players.Even now, Boycott has soured his farewell column in the Daily  with a lengthy explanation of why he believes women are incapable of doing his job, “because to provide expert analysis you need to have experienced the heat of Test cricket”. As if Charlotte Edwards, say, learned nothing about “what it takes to succeed” when she was leading England to victory in the World Cup, the World T20, and back-to-back Ashes series. As if Sarah Taylor discovered nothing about the “pressure, emotions, and technique” of international cricket while she was fighting her anxiety to become, according to better judges even than Geoffrey, “the best wicketkeeper in the world”.Yes but, yes but, yes but. There are always “yes buts” with Boycott. He’s a man who wrote about how much he loathed apartheid in his autobiography but helped to organise and lead a rebel tour to South Africa. A man who joked about blackface and denigrated the achievements of black cricketers but whose friends and colleagues insist is adamantly anti-racist (“He may be rude, bitter, mean, and many other things,” one told his biographer, Leo McKinstry, “but he is totally colour‑blind.”) A man who is often described as a bully, but who inspires such loyalty in his friends they stand by him through all this, a man who is damned as one of the most selfish men ever to play the game but who has raised millions for charity.He is a man who knew as much about cricket as anyone who ever played or watched it and yet cloaked that knowledge in tired cliches and tiresome barbs.And he is a man who was convicted of assaulting Moore, and lost his appeal against the verdict, but whose insistence he is innocent is supported by evidence and expert testimony that the case might have been a miscarriage of justice.When the judge who convicted him, Dominique Haumant, recalled the case in an interview with the  last year, she still seemed indignant about how obnoxious his behaviour had been during the trial. “Definitely not a gentleman,” she said, “vulgar”, “arrogant,” and with “a deplorable attitude”. Like almost everyone else who’s ever met, watched, or listened to Boycott, Haumant made up her mind a long time ago and isn’t about to change it now.He is a mess of contradictions. The last of them that a man who is so complicated should be so blunt in his views, that a man who has so often been given the benefit of both sides of the argument has made such a point of painting the world in black and white.Which is why, in the last, it’s fair to say it was long past time for Boycott to go and that his particular style of commentary is out of place and out of time in an era when the game is trying so hard to broaden its appeal.He won’t much care anyway. “I also wish to thank all those who have said how much they enjoyed my commentary,” he wrote at the weekend, “and for those who haven’t – too bad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a12196607a1e499719d67cfddadcdbb27379cabe/112_79_1582_950/master/1582.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b6bdd74c73f08bb846226728099b9d37","title":"georgia election primary long lines broken voting machines","story":"Equipment malfunctions and long waits to vote despite the state having encouraged people to vote by mailGeorgia voters immediately encountered hours-long lines and equipment malfunctions as they showed up to vote in person in the state’s primary races on Tuesday. Today is the latest high-stakes test of whether a state can hold an election during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u0026nbspTuesday also marked the first time Georgia was using new voting equipment, and voters reported malfunctions on Tuesday morning. The Atlanta mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, tweeted that at some precincts no machines were working.Voters snaked around the parking lot of the Lions Club community center in Cobb County, where many said around noon that they had been waiting in line for two to three hours. At least half of the voters appeared to be wearing masks, and some voters carried umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun.Chloe Mexile Benard, 33, said she had been waiting since 7.30am to vote. She reached the front of the line around noon, cheering as she was finally ushered in by a volunteer. She came to vote for the presidential primary, but also to choose the county commissioner and county sheriff, she said.\u0026nbspAsked why she didn’t vote with a mail-in ballot, Benard, whose T-shirt said “Dreams don’t expire,” said she doesn’t trust them. “I requested it. I received it, but I don’t trust anybody,” she said. “I don’t trust them to count it.”\u0026nbspBenard said there were just two voting machines at the station when she arrived. Then, “two more appeared, magically,” she said. Geraldine Aldridge, a polling manager at the site, said seven machines including one for handicapped voters, were working at noon.\u0026nbspAmid the equipment failures, some voters in Atlanta were being told to vote on back-up provisional ballots, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. But at least one precinct told the paper that they did not have access to provisional ballots.\u0026nbspThe problems in Georgia add to mounting concerns over whether states are prepared to hold elections in November. Like many other states, Georgia encouraged voters to cast their ballot by mail, but was plagued by delays in getting voters ballots and still saw extremely long lines at the polls. Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Washington DC have all seen similar problems in their recent primaries.In Fulton county, Simone Alisa, 66, said she requested a mail-in ballot but never received one. Two voters in line next to her said they did not receive their ballots either. Alisa said she waited for close to three hours to cast her vote for the presidential primary, district attorney and state court judges.\u0026nbsp“This isn’t normal,” said Alisa, who says she has voted in Fulton County for the past 10 years. She said she has never waited for more than thirty minutes to cast her ballot.By November, Alisa hopes to see improvements. “Either we receive our absentee ballot,” she said. “By that time, I would think we can have more people facilitate the voting.”\u0026nbspOn their way out of the Central Park Recreation Center, where the voting took place, Ashraf and Laurel Hussain, 37 and 48, said they had waited four and a half hours before entering the building. The pair said they were worried about the coronavirus after seeing that none of the touchscreens used to cast votes were sanitized by poll workers.The pair said they had requested mail-in ballots in late April, but never received them.“We wanted to avoid having to interact in the covid situation, but unfortunately we were kind of forced to,” Ashraf said.Like other voters, they said they were grateful for the volunteers (some of whom were candidates themselves) offering bottled water and snacks to those standing in line.“From a local level, they’re doing everything they can do. But it seems like they weren’t necessarily given the tools to do what they needed to do,” said Ashraf.\u0026nbspGeorgia’s presidential primary was originally supposed to take place in March, but has been twice delayed because of Covid-19. Brad Raffensperger, the state’s top election official, encouraged people to vote by mail, and an unprecedented 1.5 million Georgians requested absentee ballots for the election. But some counties reported severe delays in processing the requests and some voters in the state reported never receiving the ballots they requested, forcing them to go to the polls to vote in person.\u0026nbspThe absentee ballot delays and polling consolidations created a toxic mix for voters, resulting in long lines. Some voters reported waiting upwards of four hours to vote on Friday in Atlanta, the final day of early voting there.\u0026nbspYolanda Pryor-Glenn, a 52-year old retiree, said she came to vote for the Cobb county superior court seat which is up for grabs. Pryor-Glenn said the long-lines and lack of resources deployed at the polling station seemed like “a different version of suppression”.\u0026nbsp“Why were there only four machines when you could have had 10?,” she said.\u0026nbsp“Do better, Georgia,” Benard said.\u0026nbspRaffensperger told the Washington Post many of the problems appeared to be focused in Fulton county, which includes Atlanta and its suburbs. And at least seven polling locations in the Atlanta metro area did not open on time, said Seth Bringman, a spokesman for Fair Fight Action, the voting rights group started by Stacey Abrams.Raffensperger’s office blamed the delays on human error.“So far we have no reports of any actual equipment issues. We do have reports of equipment being delivered to the wrong locations and delivered late. We have reports of poll workers not understanding setup or how to operate voting equipment,” Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for the secretary of state’s office said in a statement Tuesday morning. “While these are unfortunate, they are not issues of the equipment but a function of counties engaging in poor planning, limited training, and failures of leadership. Well over 2,000 precincts are functioning normally throughout the state of Georgia.”\u0026nbspHours later, Raffensperger released his own statement focusing on problems in two Atlanta-area counties in the state. The Associated Press reported that the problems were not confined to those areas.“The voting situation today in certain precincts in Fulton and Dekalb counties is unacceptable. My office has opened an investigation to determine what these counties need to do to resolve these issues before November’s election,” Raffensperger said.“Obviously, the first time a new voting system is used there is going to be a learning curve, and voting in a pandemic only increased these difficulties. But every other county faced these same issues and were significantly better prepared to respond so that voters had every opportunity to vote.”In addition to Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia and North Dakota are all holding primaries on Tuesday.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30a4b1410dfe56d14e0f260cd6865f6a82e6c10/0_266_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03d3e6a186eddea6eb4305434f1f30cf","title":"what is coronavirus r number and is it rising in uk","story":"Research suggests the average number of people one person infects may be increasing – but opinions differ as to why With models suggesting that R could have risen above 1 in some parts of the UK, we look at what that means and how concerned we should be:R is a measure of the average number of people one infected person will go on to infect. If R is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but if it is below 1, the outbreak shrinks.The latest official estimates – produced by a group of researchers called Spi-M and based on multiple models – put R at between 0.7 and 0.9 for the whole of the UK, and between 0.7 and 1 for England alone.However, research by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge\u0026nbspUniversity suggests R is on the rise. R is now at around 1 for the south-west and just over 1 for north-west England.Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) also say the overall R may be creeping up, but put R in the south-west at 1and 0.8 in the north-west.There are a number of possibilities. One is that as lockdown measures have been eased, community transmission has risen. But speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Prof John Edmunds, an LSHTM epidemiologist, suggested another reason.“The large amount of community transmission that was occurring a couple of months ago has not come to a complete stop, but has reduced enormously,” he said. Instead, he argued, the epidemic has been concentrated in settings such as care homes and hospitals, where infections spread efficiently, meaning they are now influencing the average R to a greater degree, and hence R appears to have crept up. While spread of the virus in hospitals and care homes is of deep concern, and could seed infections in the community, Edmunds’ explanation suggests the relaxation of lockdown measures is not the main driver of the upward creep in R, and different measures may be required to tackle the trend. However, Edmunds said the key question that remains is whether transmission in the community is also rising – something he says is unclear, despite the PHECambridge team arguing that the rise in R “is probably due to increasing mobility and mixing between households and in public and workplace settings”.“They actually have that embedded in their model, that assumption,” said Edmunds, noting that the team drew on Google mobility data, which shows people moving around more. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that contact between iniduals has been going up by anywhere near the same amount.“We have been measuring people’s contact behaviour over the last two months or so and that has crept up a … very small amount, but hasn’t returned to anywhere near pre-lockdown levels.”When asked at a press briefing on Friday whether he believed R was above 1 in the community anywhere in the UK, Dr\u0026nbspPaul\u0026nbspBirrell, a co-author of the Cambridge study, said it was hard to say with certainty, “but my strong suspicion is that R is below 1 in the community, but is increasing”.The PHECambridge study reveals that while the median figure for R is 1.01 in the north-west, the full range of possible values is 0.83 to 1.18. Similar ranges are seen for the other regions.That means that it is not certain whether R is truly above or below 1 anywhere. Edmunds noted that other models give different figures: “I would stress that overall, the assessment is that it is still below 1 probably everywhere on average.” Recent lockdown relaxations are expected to be reflected in R figures over the course of the coming week.Also important to consider is the number of infections. When they are widespread across the community, an R above 1 is very concerning as it could mean a rise in cases that spreads to new areas – as happened at the start of the outbreak. Infection rates in the north-west remain high, so it is important to establish whether R in the community there is indeed above 1.However, as the overall number of infections in the community reaches low levels,\u0026nbspa large R may arise from a local outbreak or cluster of infections – a very different scenario. Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: “If R equals 1.1, and you have 10 infected, that is only 11 new cases, which means that ramping up efforts can easily contain it – if 1,000 are infected, that is 1,100 more, which is much harder.”If R is sustained above 1, however, the situation could rapidly deteriorate. Kao noted repeated outbreaks could also raise the risk of the infection spreading to new areas or triggering a new outbreak in a hospital or care home. In addition, experts warn, at low levels of infection, uncertainty in R increases.Dr Sebastian Funk of the LSHTM said the UK government appeared to be happy with R floating around 1, despite infections remaining relatively high. “That will come with the risk of higher number of deaths and morbidity compared to a scenario where you drive the disease to lower numbers before loosening the physical distancing measures,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43b66515bbb72262c6848eadf629435bb9150cad/0_176_5004_3002/master/5004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bca1aaf433dd7aac18f91de08b4182e5","title":"a beautiful day new zealand handshakes and hugs its way back to pre covid 19 life","story":"There may be tough economic times, and fresh cases, ahead but for now New Zealanders can enjoy a day free of coronavirus restrictions“I just had a meeting with someone and I thought, ‘Do I shake your hand?’” says Casey Allum, who was among those flocking to eat lunch at Wellington’s sunny, sparkling waterfront on Tuesday. Handshakes had been verboten until midnight on Monday, as people were required to stay a metre apart from colleagues, or two metres from strangers.“Then he came in with the handshake,” Allum says. “And I thought, ‘Oh sweet, that’s easy’.”New Zealanders woke on Tuesday to no restrictions on their daily lives for the first time since 21 March, with all remaining rules lifted after the country’s last known case of Covid-19 recovered from the virus. People in a nation that appears to have vanquished the coronavirus – for the time being – were permitted to hug and kiss strangers, to stand shoulder to shoulder at rock concerts, pray in large groups at mosques and churches, attend rugby games and attend large wedding parties or funerals.Strict border controls remain, with New Zealanders and their families the only people permitted to enter the country. They must remain in government-run quarantine for 14 days.The announcement by the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, that all other rules would be lifted at midnight – earlier than expected – sparked joy for many. Juliet Gerrard, the prime minister’s chief science adviser, said she was enjoying “a cheeky midnight single malt” at the time the restrictions were officially removed. Others posted images of fireworks and wished each other a “happy new year.”\u0026nbspWhile no one was openly hugging in the streets on Tuesday, those walking outdoors were giddy with pleasure at the new status. The daring even pushed pedestrian crossing buttons with their hands, rather than the crouched elbow-jab New Zealanders have resorted to during the pandemic.\u0026nbsp“A little cheer” went up in Scott Harris’s office, where he and his central Wellington colleagues had held a “watching party” for Ardern’s news conference. He was most excited about returning to his favourite game.“Me and my mates run a lacrosse club,” he says, adding that it was “quite hard to run a contact sport with one-metre distancing.”Bars and nightclubs are also readying themselves for perhaps the most raucous Tuesday night they might ever have, as rules requiring patrons to remain seated and physically distanced, receiving only table service, were jettisoned.Kieran O’Malley’s staff at the Fork \u0026amp Brewer pub had spent the morning dragging furniture from storage ready to boost their capacity to its pre-pandemic 250 people, instead of the 100 the bar was permitted to accommodate during the later stages of Covid-19 restrictions.\u0026nbsp“It’s a godsend,” he says, adding that turnover had been “down by half” under the physical distancing rules. The government had made the right decision in shutting the country down, O’Malley says, but it had been tough and his business had needed more support.\u0026nbsp“Now we’re back to normal,” he says. “But it’s going to be a while before we build confidence back again.”In the window of one central Wellington gift shop on Tuesday, a quirky shrine to “St Ashley” has been erected Ashley Bloomfield, the mild-mannered, often cautious health official. has become a household name during the crisis, with his face printed on tea towels and turned into heroic memes online.Bloomfield, after reporting that 1,053 Covid-19 tests processed the day before had uncovered no new cases, says with a rare smile that it was “a beautiful day in Wellington”.But he warned that New Zealand had not seen the last of the pandemic.“We know this will happen,” he says, referring to the prospect of fresh diagnoses. “It may be that we detect a case at the border … we may even find cases still here on our community onshore.”Ardern has voiced her anger at learning that The Warehouse, a locally owned big-box retail chain, was considering more than 1,000 job cuts, which the company said had been accelerated by the pandemic.\u0026nbsp“I do think they are a company that has promoted themselves as being in the community and for the community,” Ardern said, adding that many smaller businesses had resisted job losses.Knowing that victory might only be temporary did not take the gloss off for New Zealanders: both the capital’s and Christchurch’s daily newspapers feature a full-page cartoon on their covers, with a kiwi – the flightless bird – standing atop the figure one, delineating New Zealand’s lowest alert level, as spectators look on in awe.\u0026nbspThe weather report reads: “A fine, still day to welcome in level 1 and all the freedoms we used to take for granted.”Betrothed couples turned their attention again to their weddings, with restrictions limiting gatherings to 100 people lifted.“I’ve already had two of the brides who were thinking about it come to me and say, ‘We can set a date and get on with it,’” says Julie Lassen, a Christchurch-based celebrant, adding that even though couples could not invite overseas guests, some had decided to proceed anyway. “It’s made a huge difference because now everyone can relax and hug each other.”The lifting of rules was good news, too, for fans of New Zealand’s most beloved sport: rugby. The domestic competition will be the first professional rugby competition in the world to welcome fans en masse to sports grounds in the Covid-19 era when games kick off in Auckland and Dunedin this weekend. Stadiums are permitted to be filled to capacity.But public health experts still worry about the state of the country’s contact tracing.The country has recorded 1,504 confirmed cases and just 22 deaths after Ardern locked down New Zealand at the 200-case mark. Most say that despite the country’s seeming lucky escape from Covid-19, they would return to normal life with slightly cleaner hands than before.“We’re spraying and sanitising lots. It’s great to see every guy in the toilets washing their hands,” says O’Malley. “People sanitising their hands is great. Why not keep doing it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/888bfe5522e14cff51bc91c5d5c11af266437eba/291_365_2343_1406/master/2343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82cc77bf343a3aa8a32b6fff5912c46b","title":"catherine deneuve was johnny halliday secret love book claims","story":"Revelation that celebrated actor was late rocker’s ‘Lady L’ takes France by surpriseMore than two years after his death, the French rocker Johnny Hallyday is still causing sparks between the women in his life.The late star, a notorious womaniser, is at the centre of a love-triangle spat over claims the actor Catherine Deneuve was his lifelong soulmate and a factor in his split with his first wife, the singer Sylvie Vartan.The revelation came as news to the French public, most of whom were unaware of a relationship between the two celebrities – and also, it appears, to Vartan, 75, who described the story as “crazy”.“Catherine was the secret red line of his love life. She was always there when he was heartbroken and that happened many times. In their joint solitude, they came together a lot and were always there for each other,” Lhote wrote.The writer claimed Hallyday’s relationship with Deneuve caused tensions with Vartan, the first of Hallyday’s four wives, whom he married in 1965 and orced in 1980. These came to a head during the singer’s 35th birthday celebrations in Japan in 1978, where he and Deneuve were on the jury for the Tokyo Music festival and Vartan was filming.Vartan denied the claim on Instagram.“It’s always surprising to learn things about my own life that are laughable, but not necessarily exact. For example, according to recent zany tales worthy of an embroidery or science fiction contest, it seems that when these photos were taken in Japan in 1978, I was in a state of ‘disarray’ and separated from Johnny to boot,” she wrote.“It’s funny, I don’t look at that period in the same way at all, and with good reason: taking advantage of a break during a tour I was doing in that country, I celebrated Johnny’s 35th birthday on June 15th in the company of Catherine Deneuve (both members of the Tokyo Music Festival as well as Michel Legrand, Diana Ross and others). I was neither in ‘disarray’ nor separated, then, but enjoying the pleasure and joy of sharing a happy moment with people who were dear to me.”Lhote claimed Hallyday’s fourth wife, Laeticia, who was 21 when she married the 52-year-old singer in 1996, had learned of his relationship with Deneuve after finding messages from the actor he had hidden in a book.“It was a bit complicated at the beginning, then she adapted and understood the relationship.\u0026nbspI think Laeticia asked Johnny to choose between Catherine and her. It was a tense moment, very rock’n’roll,” Lhote wrote.As the row hit the French celebrity magazines, Lhote took Vartan’s criticism in his stride. “A look or a picture is worth a thousand words,” he wrote on Instagram.Deneuve has not commented."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f21e1c8b5b5ae718357c4b52acdba337def24b9/0_116_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb74ac6f49af35f3f28518ea37e02d7c","title":"coronavirus cases uptick detected some us states","story":"A total of 14 states and the US territory of Puerto Rico have recorded their worst week yet for new coronavirus infections, with Texas hitting a record high in Covid-19 hospitalizations, all while restrictions to curb the pandemic are being relaxed across America.A resurgence in new infections has been detected in states including Florida, Texas and California, as authorities allow certain businesses and public places to reopen.According to data tracked by the Washington Post, since the start of June, 14 states and Puerto Rico have experienced their highest seven-day average of new coronavirus cases since the pandemic began. The states are Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Kentucky, New Mexico, North Carolina, Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah.The surge in cases, which public health experts have described as worrying, and had warned about repeatedly, shows that while Covid-19 is now in retreat in New York City and other major urban centres, it is sweeping across rural areas, infecting smaller towns.Figures from the Texas department of state health services\u0026nbspshowed that 1,935 people were hospitalized for coronavirus-related reasons on Monday, up from a previous record of 1,888 on 5 May. Officials in Dallas said the city hit its highest ever one-day total for new infections on Thursday, at 285, while Houston has also recorded climbing numbers.On Sunday, Florida recorded more than 1,000 newly diagnosed Covid-19 cases for the fifth day of the previous week, with Thursday’s total of 1,413 the highest since the state started providing daily updates in March.Arizona, meanwhile, has seen one of the largest jumps in the country, with the daily total in new cases breaking the state record on four separate occasions over the past week.Doug Ducey, the Arizona governor, who relaxed restrictions two weeks ago, has put the increase down to an increase in testing and insisted that his approach on reopening has been prudent.The overall number of new cases recorded each day across the US is hovering around 20,000, down from a peak of 30,000 in April, but this decrease is mainly due to the improving situation in the worst-hit states, such as New York and New Jersey.As states in the north-east experience drops in new cases, states across the south and California are seeing increases even as they loosen social distancing rules designed to prevent person-to-person transmission of the virus.Donald Trump has mostly left pandemic response to inidual states and has not addressed the crisis in a major way even as the death rate passed 100,000 Americans.Given the lag in incubation times of the virus, it appears the rise in cases has occurred around the time states started to lift restrictions, leading to scenes in the weekend of the 25 May Memorial Day holiday of people flocking to beaches and lakes and in many cases not practicing social distancing.Epidemiologists have warned the onward march of reopening will make it difficult to keep a lid on infections if an American public weary of lockdown is again asked to isolate themselves.“The worrisome thing for me is that there’s a lot of fatigue in the population overall,” said Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.“People feel they have done distancing and they are thirsting to get outside and connect with each other. If this surge requires us taking a step back, how do we convince people to do that? I feel we’ve made five steps forward and now maybe one step back.”The uptick is likely to be exacerbated by the large protest gatherings across the US in recent weeks over the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.It is unclear how strong the latest outbreak will be, although experts point out most states have helped encourage new social distancing or mask-wearing behaviours, as well as shielding the most vulnerable people.Testing rates have also ramped up over the past month, although states still lack a comprehensive system to track, trace and isolate those who have come into contact with an infected person.“All the modeling has shown if you reopen without extensive testing and contract tracing, you’ll see an increase in the epidemic,” said Ira Longini, professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. “That activity is not happening in an organized way in Florida, it’s haphazard. That points towards an increase over summer and then a potentially much bigger increase in the fall.”Longini warned that there was no sign of the epidemic going away in Florida, and it was increasing, and the situation was unpredictable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71a195afb35adee7e7bbd00a7f2a90026c948aeb/0_68_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16ad4855b0786ebad1151c43fd4d3975","title":"coronavirus leaves one in 10 uk charities facing bankruptcy this year","story":"Study reveals sector struggling with £10bn funding shortfall as demand for services rises One in 10 UK charities are facing bankruptcy by the end of the year as they struggle to cope with a £10bn shortfall caused by soaring demand for their services and lost fundraising income due to the coronavirus pandemic, a study shows.The analysis by Pro Bono Economics, an independent charity, says the coronavirus crisis will trigger a £6.4bn loss of income for charities over the next six months just as demand for extra services – ranging from health to debt advice and social care – piles on extra costs of £3.7bn.Household-name charities are also facing serious problems, with some saying the sudden rise in operating costs since the lockdown in March has forced them to use public donations to prop up services they provide under contract to local authorities and central government.They include the National Trust, which has identified a shortfall of £200m this year, Age UK, which is reporting a £42m deficit, and Cancer Research UK, which has warned it will lose about £120m in donated income over the next 12 months.“If we don’t funnel more resource to charities in the coming weeks, it’s clear that many will struggle to survive,” said Matt Whittaker, the chief executive of Pro Bono Economics.“The fact that one in 10 charities expect to go under in the next six months is on its own a shocking enough statistic. But once we add in the significant constraints being faced by many of those organisations that do survive, we’re looking at a huge hit to the overall capacity of the sector.”Whittaker said the government’s £750m bailout fund for the voluntary sector announced in April was not enough given the scale of the problem. The crisis would undermine the charity sector’s ability to nurture and encourage the upsurge of volunteering and community spirit that has emerged over the past three months. \u0026nbspKarl Wilding, the chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), said the Pro Bono estimates of £10bn by Christmas were in line with others he had seen. The analysis effectively updates the NCVO’s earlier estimate of a £4.3bn shortfall for the sector over three months.Wilding said the charities most likely to be hit by rising demand and falling income were those working in housing, social care, mental health and in disadvantaged communities. “The crisis has not been a great leveller for charities: some are hit harder than others. We must remember that these are organisations that people depend upon,” he said.Neil Heslop, the chief executive of Leonard Cheshire, the disability care charity, said it faced a worst-case scenario shortfall of up to £20m this year – about a sixth of its annual income – because of additional costs of up to £2m month providing personal protective equipment and extra staff at its 120 residential homes.He said the charity had not been able to access any of the government’s bailout funds and had been unable to access support for its extra costs from the local authorities and NHS bodies for whom it provides services under contract. “Without support we will face difficult decisions in the coming months,” he said.Pro Bono Economics was set up to provide economic advice to charities. Its chair is the former cabinet secretary Gus O’Donnell, and its high-powered trustees include Andy Haldane, the chief economist\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspBank of England, and Clare Lombardelli, the Treasury’s chief economic adviser.Its research is based on a weekly charity tracker survey set up just after the lockdown to monitor the pressures facing civil society. The latest tracker, carried out in early June, was based on data from 261 civil society organisations across the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331ddd48182d097c8e5435aef124a82237bfe251/0_131_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f541e33e61169f201f33db4871ecd44","title":"dalai lama to release album of mantras and teachings set to music","story":"‘Music has the potential to reach many more people,’ says the Tibetan spiritual leaderThe Dalai Lama, whose message of humanity, harmony and peace delivered with a smile has won millions of global followers, is releasing an album of mantras set to music to mark his 85th birthday next month.The Tibetan spiritual leader’s first foray into the world of recorded music comes five years after he appeared at the Glastonbury music festival, where he warned of the dangers of climate change, and the American star Patti Smith sang Happy Birthday to him on stage.Inner World, to be released on 6 July, consists of 11 tracks on which the Dalai Lama recites sacred mantras and teachings with accompanying music performed on more than 30 instruments.One track, Compassion, released in advance on Tuesday, is a version of one of the most famous Buddhist prayers.Explaining his decision to make the album, which took five years to complete, the Dalai Lama said: “Music has the potential to reach many more people with the message that the real source of happiness is warm-heartedness and a concern for others.“The very purpose of my life is to serve as much as I can.”Known to Buddhists as His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama has been the spiritual leader of Tibet for more than 75 years. He was identified as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama at the age of two by Buddhist monks scouring remote villages in the Tibetan countryside, and has since become the longest-living incumbent, seeing countless world leaders come and go in his time.In 1950, China invaded Tibet and seized control of the region. After an uprising against Beijing’s rule in 1959 the Dalai Lama fled in disguise to India, where for more than six decades since he has lived in exile in the Himalayan town of Dharamshala. More than 80,000 Tibetan Buddhists followed their spiritual and political leader to establish a refugee mini-state.The Chinese regime routinely denounces the Dalai Lama as a “splittist wolf in monk’s clothing”. Heads of state and political leaders are vigorously lobbied by the Chinese to decline invitations to meetings artists and celebrities who publicly support the Dalai Lama find they are not welcome in China. Beijing was furious when he was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1989.China has said it intends to choose the next spiritual leader when the present Dalai Lama dies – or, as he puts it, has “a change of clothes”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f0d43ad592ad49168c4772b86898ff9be0d7c15/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b5cc882b0c363cc0858816f80b30c9d","title":"sadiq khan orders review of all london statues for slavery links","story":"Move follows toppling of Colston statue by Black Lives Matter protesters in BristolAll statues in Labour councils across England and Wales, plus across London and Manchester, will be examined for links to slavery and plantation owners, their leaders have said.Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, said the city’s landmarks – including street names, the names of public buildings and plaques – will be reviewed by a commission to ensure they reflect the capital’s ersity, with a view to removing those with links to slavery after Black Lives Matter protesters tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol.\u0026nbspIn Manchester, the council announced a city-wide review of all the statues in Manchester “to understand their history and context”. Councillor Luthfur Rahman said members of the public would also be asked for suggestions on “missing” statues.“We also want to take this opportunity to ask the public who is missing – who should be celebrated but is not – with particular thought around representing the proud BAME (black and minority ethnic) history of Manchester and help to reflect the shared story of our erse and multicultural city,” he said.Manchester city council is under pressure to remove a statue of Sir Robert Peel in Piccadilly Gardens. Over a thousand people have\u0026nbspsigned a petition\u0026nbspdemanding the removal of the memorial to the two-time British prime minister, born in Bury in Greater Manchester, on the grounds that his father was known to be pro-slavery.Labour councils across England and Wales will begin reviews in their towns and cities, too, the Local Government Association’s Labour group said. It will ask council leaders to work with their communities to review “the appropriateness” of monuments and statues in their areas.Speaking to broadcasters on Tuesday, Khan said he did not condone breaking the law and wanted there to be a proper process for the removal of any statues that do not reflect London’s values.He would not name which ones should come down, saying it would be a matter for the new commission, but said there were clearly statues commemorating slavers in the capital.Khan’s new Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm will also consider which legacies should be celebrated before making recommendations about new statues and which could be removed.\u0026nbsp“It is an uncomfortable truth that our nation and city owes a large part of its wealth to its role in the slave trade and while this is reflected in our public realm, the contribution of many of our communities to life in our capital has been wilfully ignored.\u0026nbspThis cannot continue …“The Black Lives Matter protests have rightly brought this to the public’s attention, but it’s important that we take the right steps to work together to bring change and ensure that we can all be proud of our public landscape.”\u0026nbspThe commission – which will be co-chaired by Debbie Weekes-Bernard, the deputy mayor for social integration, social mobility and community engagement, and the deputy mayor for culture and creative industries, Justine Simons – will include historians as well as arts, council and community leaders.\u0026nbspPressed on Sky News about where to draw the line, given Winston Churchill held some racist views, Khan said the cases of Churchill, Gandhi and Malcolm X showed that many great historical figures were not perfect and history should be taught “warts and all”. But there were clear-cut figures such as those actively involved in the slave trade and ownership who should not be celebrated, the mayor said.Khan announced the commission as he attempted to defuse tensions in London ahead of more planned anti-racism demonstrations. The London mayor is also pressing the politan police, the UK’s largest force, over the use of stop and search, stun guns and other practices amid concerns\u0026nbspabout the spread of coronavirus\u0026nbspin crowds, and fears of violence as it emerged that far-right groups were planning counter-demonstrations.The global Black Lives Matter protests were sparked by the death in the US of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer who held him with a knee on his neck for nine minutes while he protested: “I can’t breathe.”The UK government has come under fire for its claim that the spreading protests are related to the US rather than prejudice in the UK and denials that Britain is a racist country.Boris Johnson said on Monday that Floyd’s death had awakened an “incontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice” worldwide.\u0026nbsp He had previously condemned the “thuggery” by a minority that marred some demonstrations but acknowledged many of the activists’ concerns were “founded on a cold reality”.\u0026nbspHe said leaders “simply can’t ignore” concerns that black, Asian and minority ethnic groups face discrimination in education, employment and the criminal justice system.\u0026nbspHowever, the prime minister said those who harmed police or property would face “the full force of the law”.\u0026nbspKeir Starmer, the Labour leader, has\u0026nbspsaid it was “completely wrong”\u0026nbspfor protesters to pull down the statue of Colston and dump it in the harbour in Bristol – putting him at odds with some MPs on the left of his party – while emphasising the monument should never have been there in the first place.After police stood by and watched the statue being toppled in Bristol, the focus will shift on Tuesday to Oxford, where hundreds of students and residents are expected to attend a protest calling for the removal of Oxford University’s\u0026nbspstatue of\u0026nbspthe colonialist Cecil Rhodes.A symbolic and socially distanced commemoration is planned at the Nelson Mandela statue in Parliament Square in London at 5pm, organised by Stand Up To Racism.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f03476d44d36d3448c96ba5391488c54728e4bb5/0_172_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=350d3f7ff005e8160b1987a785430d26","title":"who expert backtracks after saying asymptomatic transmission very rare","story":"But Dr Maria Van Kerkhove maintained that real world data suggested it could still be a rare event when she took part in a social media Q\u0026ampA to explain herself, saying she was not referencing the modelling studies when she spoke.Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead, said that on asymptomatic transmission “we don’t have the answer yet”. Her comment at the WHO’s Monday press briefing about its rarity was based on two or three studies following up the contacts of asymptomatic people, and unpublished data shared by countries or experts with her organisation.“I used the phrase ‘very rare’ and I think that it’s a misunderstanding to state the asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare. What I was referring to was a subset of studies. I was also referring to some data that isn’t published,” she said.It was certain that asymptomatic infection happened, she said, but how often was still one of the great unknowns about Covid-19 that scientists were investigating. One of the complications is that some people who appear to be infected but asymptomatic are in fact pre-symptomatic – they can go on to, for instance, experience a mild course of disease. “They may not register that they are sick,” she said.One of the critical issues is how long people are infectious before they develop symptoms and how infectious they are in the days before they are clearly ill. “It is not only who is transmitting to others, but when,” she said. “The data is very preliminary.” They were working with countries to get answers, she said.It is possible that asymptomatic people do not have high levels of virus in their body. The main source of infection is droplet transmission through the air, but until people are ill enough to be coughing, for instance, they may not so easily transmit the infection.“It appears that people have more virus in their body around the time they develop symptoms,” she said. That was different from the experience of Sars, which was an infection lower down the respiratory tract.“With Covid-19, the infectious pathogen is in the upper airway where viral loads are peaking just as you are starting to feel sick,” said Dr Mike Ryan, the head of the WHO’s health emergencies programme.There was a period of time when even a professor of infectious diseases would not be able to tell somebody they were ill without a test for the virus, he said, and they might feel fine but be at their most infectious. That was why the disease spread so easily, he said.“If this virus was easy to stop, everyone would have been doing it. It is not easy to stop,” he said. But, he added, “it is not so transmissible that you can’t suppress it”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df950c1237a782572ff193d161c25cd91a1ab03e/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ea4ae037fecbd22901200a80e36e42","title":"uk coronavirus live covid 19 latest updates","story":"This live blog is now closedThat’s all from us for tonight. But the coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog.This is from Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, on the announcement that non-essential shops in England can open next Monday. She said: Retailers who are not yet open have been working hard to install perspex screens, hygiene systems and apply social distancing measures.We hope the public will take the opportunity from next week to go out and support millions of stores up and down the country.Nonetheless, the challenge for these stores is not over.Many firms will continue to struggle as the 2-metre rule will limit sales while retailers continue to face the same rent and other fixed costs.If the government is to limit retailers in this way, it must be prepared to provide an ongoing package of support to address the economic difficulties they will face.The government has not published any data yet on its new test-and-trace system, and so it is impossible to know whether or not it is working well enough to meet the LSHTM benchmark for efficiency.Q: Are local R rates being calculated? Will they be published, and could they lead to local lockdowns?Sharma says the government will take action to address local flare-ups. That has happened in Weston-super-Mare, he says.Q: Will the national security and investment bill address concerns about China’s involvement in UK infrastructure?Sharma says the government is committed to the bill. But he won’t say any more about what may or may not be in it.Q: Prof Chris Whitty said last week the 2-metre rule would stay for the whole of the pandemic. Was he right?Sharma says it will be kept under review.Q: What factors will be taken into account before a decision to change it?Sharma says government will look at factors like the infection rate.Albon says science clearly shows that, at 2 metres, the risk of an infection is significantly lower than at 1 metre. So the prevalence of the illness becomes relevant, she says.Sharma says factors like being side by side, not face to face, can help.Q: Thousands of people submitted material to the BAME coronavirus review that was not published (relating to structural racism). Why was that not published?Sharma says the report was published. He summarises what it said.Q: But the communities engagement bit was missing.Sharma says the report was published.Q: You promised a review of the 2-metre rule ahead of the reopening of shops on 15 June. Has it been reviewed and will it be reduced?Sharma repeats the point about this being under review. He says he understands why business wants it reduced. But the government will only change it when it is safe to do so.Q: It is estimated that sticking with 2 metres could cost 1m jobs. Are you resigned to losing those jobs?Sharma again says this is being kept under review.Q: The PM promised a review by 15 June. Where is it?Like a stuck record, Sharma is back to saying this is being kept under review.Q: So when will the review be published?Sharma says the rule will only be changed when it is safe to do so.Q: Are you arguing to replace the 2-metre rule with a 1-metre rule?Sharma says the 2-metre rule remains in place. But it is kept under review. Some countries use one metre. But they are further down the recovery.Q: When might it be changed?Sharma says he cannot say. He says it is vital not to sacrifice the gains made so far.Another member of the public asks if the government will submit to supporting new innovative start-ups.Sharma says the Treasury has announced a scheme already. More measures are planned. Alison from London asks the first question. When can people book UK holidays and stay overnight?Sharma says he understands why people want to know the answer. But the economy is being opened in a phased manner.He sums up what has been announced already, but does not address Alison’s question.Sharma says that after the crisis the government wants to rebuild an economy that is greener, fairer and more dynamic.He will chair five roundtables looking at this project. They will feed into government policy making.Sharma says his department has provided guidance that will allow shops to open safely.If they can follow the Covid-19 secure guidelines, shops will be allowed to open.But they will have to complete a coronavirus risk assessment.They should display a notice saying they have done this.If shops open without taking these measures, they could be subject to enforcement notices.Some places will still have to remain closed, he says, and pubs, restaurants, barbers and hairdressers will get further guidance on when they can open in due course.Sharma says the government is opening parts of the economy in a careful manner.He says the government is still meeting its five tests, and the reproduction number, R, is below 1.So, he says, he can confirm that non-essential shops will be allowed to open from Monday 15 June.(He is talking about England, although he does not say so.)Sharma is now going through the daily slides.Here is the slide with the death figures.In fact, Sharma is here with an expert. I was misled. He is here with Sarah Albon, the chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive.Alok Sharma, the business secretary, is taking the UK government’s daily press conference. It will be starting shortly. He will be appearing on his own.(No 10 has in recent days stopped putting up scientists to appear alongside the ministers at this event. No 10 claims this is not because they have been banned for good. See 1.20pm. But the move has coincided with government policy increasingly erging from the scientific advice. For example, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, has refused to publicly back the quarantine policy, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical adviser, has refused to agree to lower the coronavirus threat level - which was supposed to be a precondition for lockdown measures being eased. Ministers are easing them anyway.)"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4268099.1591041917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"can student life survive online","story":"Studying and learning is moving online. But third level is about so much more than academia: it’s about getting involved, joining clubs and societies, having new experiences, making new friends and making mistakes. If the Covid-19 crisis continues well into the next academic year, will students - particularly incoming first years - miss out on that formative college experience?Across colleges and universities, student clubs and societies have been adjusting to an online life.Cian McGrath, deputy editor of UCC’s University Express, says that being involved in the college paper and societies such as NetSoc were the best part of his college experience. “NetSoc has moved a lot of our meetups online, and a lot of societies and clubs have done the same. Hopefully all colleges will have consideration for how important it is for students to meet up and make friends.”Paul Davis of Maynooth University’s sports services, says that student sports clubs and the associated professional bodies are working on ways in which sports or training can go ahead with social distancing. “We’ve been doing Zooms calls where students do speed and agility training together. Everyone needs to get out, get some air, exercise and social contact. We will have to do things differently: it will be a challenge and will have to be thought our carefully, but there will be some sort of offering.”At DCU, Dr Claire Bohan is director of student support and development. “How do we replicate the sense of being a student and the clear ide between school days and college?” she says.“Incoming first years will already have been through a tough few months. We are workshopping scenarios whereby we will be primarily online but with some on-campus learning. The campus will be open. We will do what we can within social distancing guidelines. Clubs and societies are student-led and they have been adapting fast. The big challenge isn’t continuing a social life for returning students it’s for creating a college experience for the first years who don’t know what they don’t know, and we will support them.”How might this lost opportunity impact on student mental health? “We’ve seen students who are struggling with additional stress in both their personal and family lives, while others are reporting significant improvements in their mental health,” says Marianne Dunne, director of students services and mental health at Maynooth University.“We have been able to adapt our supports such as counselling, health, budgeting and chaplaincy, using phone and video consultations, while also introducing new initiatives such as a virtual cafe, online yoga and meditation and an online book club. Overall, the level of student engagement and participation with our services since March 13th has been really positive.”Many students will be disappointed that they’re missing out on the full first year experience, but there are ways to engage now. Getting involved in a new club or society can seem daunting but most are very welcoming. All of those committee members or writers for the student paper were first years once, and because most college courses only last four years, clubs and societies are absolutely dependent on new members to keep going and to bring new ideas to life.It’s also no harm, once students know where they’re going, to look at the clubs and societies that interest them and maybe even to contact them and let them know that, despite whatever social distancing restrictions are in place, they’re keen to get involved.“We’ll be encouraging online meetups, table quizzes - anything that can get people talking and communicating,” says McGrath. “We know how important it is to welcome new students to college.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4265013.1590681756!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus irish universities prepare for students to return","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            As colleges and universities shut their doors, in came  video conferencing, online quizzes, virtual learning platforms, specialised simulations, asynchronous and synchronous teaching.

Photograph: iStockThe threat posed to public health by the coronavirus pandemic has led to universities across the globe having to address how they can continue teaching while keeping their staff and students safe.While non-essential businesses had to close their doors to the public in the space of just a few weeks in March, almost all teaching activity at Ireland’s universities and colleges had to rapidly migrate online.Course instructors had to adopt technologies that had never before been used on this scale in the experience of Irish education. All of a sudden, the virtual classroom took centre stage. Students would complete their studies online without having to attend classes in-person, while assessments and examinations were quickly reappraised and reconstituted.This migration represented the single biggest structural change in the third-level sector in Ireland in recent years. One academic referred to it as “the great onlining of Irish higher education”.While the rapid response of the sector to the pandemic was a testament to the universities and dedication of the staff involved, it quickly became apparent that this new approach, or at least a more sophisticated variant of it, would become the “new norm” for Irish education in the short to medium term.This, ideally, should mean revisiting the design of course programmes. Hastily shoe-horning course content online in response to a crisis might work as a stop-gap but it is not considered to be best practice when it comes to online education.“When done well, online teaching involves far more than putting your lecture slides on the internet and merely substituting your scheduled face-to-face classes with live online ones using Zoom or MS Teams,” says Prof Mark Brown of the National Institute for Digital Learning at DCU.“Indeed, this type of remote teaching and digital delivery of course content in a crisis is almost the antithesis of good online education,” he adds.“The challenge is to help educators understand that online education requires different learning designs and teaching approaches.”PlanningIn Ireland, colleges are already planning their own blended or hybrid approach to the delivery of education for the next academic year. In many cases, lectures will be delivered remotely while students will attend campus in smaller groups for face-to-face sessions, tutorials and lab work.While the new student experience is likely to be substantially different this year, students and their parents will expect that the integrity of academic programmes will not be compromised by the transition to online.The degree to which academic programmes will be redesigned to place online at the core of curriculum delivery still remains to be seen.Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the State’s watchdog for education standards, has already stated that it is working with partners across the education and training sector “to support and provide leadership for FET and HE providers in their efforts to maintain the integrity, quality and standards of the Irish education and training system, at this time of unprecedented challenge”.Fully transitioning courses online requires fundamental course redesign, a process that is costly and resource-heavy.Instead, most colleges in Ireland are likely to offer a blended approach where some elements will be delivered online and some delivered on-campus.They will spend the remainder of the summer months fine-tuning and re-evaluating their course offerings to make sure they fulfil the needs and expectations of their students, and it will probably be August before it becomes clear what students can expect in the autumn.Of course, any lengthy continuation of campus closures is likely to have significant and unforeseen implications for students and colleges alike. Universities have lost considerable revenues over the summer months from the loss of tourism and conferences, not to mention the losses likely to be incurred by the absence of foreign student revenues.Students are also likely to feel somewhat uncertain of what lies ahead with many questioning whether the costs normally associated with full-time college are justifiable when courses will be delivered online.Campus lifeMany academic, learning and social support services designed with on-campus students in mind will have to be adapted and innovative opportunities will have to be developed to assist students who wish to engage in the wider life of the university, including sports clubs and societies.Of course, huge uncertainties lie ahead and many students will ask whether they should plan for a return to campus this year or should they delay going to college by a year in the hope of a return to some degree of normality by then.In this supplement we look at some of the issues that are likely to arise in the upcoming academic year. We ask if it is possible to improve learning outcomes through online learning and examine what options are available to school-leavers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4270663.1591353131!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"where to begin when it comes to teaching a course online","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“The use of smaller, bite-sized chunks of information for all alternative formats used makes it easier for learners to engage with the content.”The starting point for instructors looking to move their programmes online should be to seek professional help. Most universities will have a Department for Online and Distance Learning and they will have the expertise required to help instructors understand what exactly online delivery will entail. Not every course will lend itself well solely to online delivery while others may enjoy improved outcomes when delivered through a well-designed bespoke online framework.Training is key. Delivering a course originally designed for in-class delivery to an online setting will require an understanding of the new format, the tools available as well as an insight into student expectations and planned course outcomes. The more prepared the teacher or instructor is, the better.Expectations are important too. Be aware of what students expect to get from the course and clearly set out how the course will function throughout the year and how students will be assessed. Prepare a course handbook and make that permanently available to students through the learning platform. “Set expectations as to the level of engagement required and have a clear statement of how the course will be assessed along with an assessment of engagement required,” she adds.Technology should be a concern! There should be an awareness that internet access and availability of digital resources will be an issue for some students. Therefore, certain flexibilities will have to be accounted for in the design of the course to accommodate them and their needs.The nature of the subject area is also important. Think creatively about how you will teach the course. Consider the tools available to you through the virtual learning environment. There are ways you could increase engagement through the use of online quizzes and other dedicated tools.One of the key strengths of online or distance learning is that students can prepare material in advance of a classroom session. Make that material available to them. It can be packaged into course reading packs or short recorded lectures, podcasts or video recordings for them to view in their own time.“The use of smaller, bite-sized chunks of information for all alternative formats used makes it easier for learners to engage with the content in a flexible format and increases the assimilation of information,” says McGuinn.Building prompts or check-ins for students asking them to carry out an exercise or directing them to research the concept further is a way to keep them interested and engaged in the course.Decide how you wish to use your live sessions with students - it is not advised to simply regurgitate the course notes. Instead, consider live settings as a dedicated learning opportunity where you can also encourage student discussion.Make sure to build in opportunities for pastoral support for students and check in to see how they are coping with online learning."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Such plants are 35 times more efficient at capturing and storing carbon than tropical forestsFaster cuts in methane and nitrous oxide from farming needed \u0026ndash Stop Climate ChaosOn-farm measures are key to reducing emissions - environmental watchdog"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteria"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274693.1591713494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"water shortages as hosepipe ban starts what is happening with leaks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBohernabreena reservoir in Dublin where water levels are low following the driest spring on record. Photograph: PA The ongoing drought across much of Ireland and the introduction of a hosepipe ban on June 9th – the second in less than two years – has brought renewed focus on the massive level of ongoing leakage in the Irish water supply system.Up to recently, close to half the treated water in the State was being lost through leaky pipes a problem that was most pronounced in the greater Dublin region – the most populated part of the country.The level of leakage continues to be unacceptable, according to Dr Tom Collins of the Water Forum, a statutory advisory body. “It makes no sense to be providing all this water, to be cleaning all this water, and to be losing all this water,” he adds.The problem, however, is there is no short-term solution, though there is some evidence of progress. Digging up streets to repair or replace pipes can be hugely disruptive to a city, though new approaches mean quicker repairs and less inconvenience.Irish Water operates 63,000 km of water network, treating 1,700 million litres of water daily via almost 800 water treatment plants. The national water utility can sustainably supply the greater Dublin area with 582 million litres of water a day.Working in partnership with local authorities and contracting partners, Irish Water is carrying out targeted leakage detection and repairs across the country with a special focus on those areas where water services are under “water stress”.Prior to the Covid-19 restrictions, 1,500 leaks were fixed every month.The current leakage rate nationally is 42.3 per cent. In the Greater Dublin Area it has been reduced to 37.5 per cent.Irish Water is on track to reduce overall leakage to 38 per cent and save 166 million litres of drinking water daily nationally by 2021, including 44 million litres in the Greater Dublin Area through an investment of €500 million.The 2021-2024 investment plan, will also see the utility invest approximately €100 million per year in leakage reduction.Gross leakage savings for 2019 were 143.7 million litres per day. When Irish Water was established, leakage nationally was 49 per cent.“Irish Water’s leakage reduction programme teams are now fully re-mobilised on the ground, but we also need the public’s support to reduce their water usage. We continue to ask the public to notify us of leaks on which we always follow up,” a spokeswoman for the utility has pointed out.The long-term solution, Dr Collins believes, is a national strategy on conservation, including accelerated leakage reduction. This should incorporate new building regulations, he suggests, requiring innovative water management to be deployed, such as raw water harvesting in new houses and institutional buildings including schools.“Of course, we only have these conversations when we have a drought,” he observes.He remains concerned about the vulnerability of Dublin, which is so important to the Irish economy and has such a large, growing population.The river Liffey supplies over 80 per cent of the city’s water supply, extracting 40 per cent of all its waters, close to the upper threshold of environmental and sustainable limits.In that context, the levels of water leakage have to be confronted, though he accepts solving the problem “is a massive undertaking” in both complexity and financial cost.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Eliminating Covid-19 through tougher short-term measures represents the “most scientifically sound” strategy for Ireland, according to a group of Irish researchers.In an open letter published on Monday, the group of scientists and academics says Ireland has “come to a watershed moment . . . the path we choose will determine our future for years to come”.They acknowledge the huge impact already on the economy but suggest measures now be deployed to “crush” the virus on an all-island basis, as many other countries have done. This, they add, is possible over a number of weeks not months.Signatories include public health specialists infectious disease experts, virologists, immunologists, and doctors including respiratory and intensive care consultants working in acute hospitals – many of whom worked on the frontline during the height of the pandemic.“Our current policy is to live with the virus under a long-term mitigation strategy, with the risk of future surges and lockdowns until when, or if, a vaccine becomes available. We have another option: we can do as many other countries have done, choose to suppress and eliminate this virus – ‘crushing the curve’,” they suggest.‘Normal’Because of a timely response the island of Ireland managed to bring the epidemic under control, they point out.“A range of emergency restrictions imposed by the two Governments, following scientific advice, stopped our healthcare systems being overwhelmed and saved many lives. The public support these restrictions, and report that they clearly understood the need for them.”All this had come at a huge cost, they note, with enormous sums of money spent many losing jobs and businesses wondering if they will be able to open again.People will once again feel confident in using public transport, returning to school, going out to eat and to shop, pressure on the healthcare system will be relieved, and trust in our economy will be restored, they accept.“For the economies on our island, this would be enormously valuable. Vulnerable people will be effectively protected.”There was, however, a push to get back to “normal” as fast as possible. “What does ‘normal’ look like if the virus continues to circulate? Right now, public transport is planning for 20 per cent of ‘normal’ capacity, pubs and restaurants 30 per cent, schools, at best only 50 per cent.“The costs of childcare, already high, will be impossible for many. Many workplaces will need expensive re-design. Many people will drop out, or be pushed out of the labour force. All of these are real costs, and will, we believe, far exceed the short-term costs of lockdown.”“For these reasons we strongly encourage the Governments to take resolute actions to suppress this pandemic at once. Eliminating the virus represents the most scientifically sound strategy in terms of public health and economics alike.”“Several countries have already largely halted the virus, including South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Austria, Greece, China and Iceland, by continuing public health measures, including the use of masks, active fast contact tracing and testing, and sensible restrictions on travel.”Such measures were planned for both parts of this island, “but they must be enhanced and coordinated – with the aim of achieving ambitious suppression targets”.This should be on the basis of first achieving suppression and elimination of Covid-19, “and then we must maintain it”.Realistic exit strategyThese countries achieved suppression, and some have demonstrated they can also maintain it in the face of new cases, as seen in South Korea. “Each country has developed its own solutions, to fit its own needs, and we can do the same on our joint island,” the scientists underline.“All our sacrifices over the last two months have driven down the number of cases, and given us a precious window of opportunity that we must not squander. This is a decisive moment in the history of our island.”The goal should be to suppress the number of new cases to zero as soon as possible, and to keep them there. Given political leadership, an agreed and scientifically sound strategy, and cooperation from citizens, “this can be done, and done in weeks, not in months”.“When we reach this goal, new infections have to be closely monitored for the foreseeable future under a robust, rapid, and vigilant testtraceisolate infrastructure.”Alternatively, if the country decides to live with the virus, they believe, “extensive, and expensive, restrictions will continue for the foreseeable future. A vaccine will take at least two years, and there is no established treatment”.Societies that have suppressed and eliminated this pandemic will enjoy considerably greater freedoms and prosperity than those where the virus persists, the signatories predict. Travel, tourism, and trade with other successful countries would be straightforward and beneficial.Given Ireland’s geography, population size and social cohesion, suppression was a realistic exit strategy “a genuine way out of our current economic and social standstill”.Lead signatories are epidemiologist Prof Anthony Staines of DCU infectious diseases ecologist Prof Gerard Killeen of UCC and immunologist Dr Tomás Ryan of TCD.The letter and signatories are available at http:crushthecurve.ie* An early version of this story incorrectly stated that 1,000 scientists had signed the letter.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFP via Getty ImagesA Covid-19 testing system producing 15,000 results every day could cost the State €450 million by the end of the year, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has said. In correspondence sent to the special Oireachtas committee on the Covid-19 response, which sits again on Tuesday, the HSE said that running 15,000 tests “per day every day” would entail projected costs “in the region of €450 million”. Currently, the HSE has capacity to test about that number on a given day, but demand for testing is significantly lower, with recent data showing fewer than 5,000 community and hospital lab tests being carried out per day.A HSE spokeswoman confirmed the sum would be for producing 15,000 tests a day every day until the end of 2020. According to the document, the HSE believes that level of testing will “clearly will not be a requirement”, but warns that the current testing system needs a significant overhaul to be fit for purpose in the medium term. A spokeswoman said that current “temporary solutions are not sustainable for the longer term”.The HSE has previously announced that it will complete a strategic plan for testing and tracing by the autumn. The briefing document emphasises that the current testing and tracing model “is not sustainable in the long term”, due to its reliance on staff and equipment which have been temporarily reassigned from elsewhere, as well as the use of community centres and sports grounds such as Croke Park as sampling centres, and reliance on short-term laboratory provider contracts. It says a longer-term testing and tracing strategy will include its own financial plan.Testing equipmentSo far, the HSE has spent almost €80 million on testing and tracing, the document shows, including €33 million procuring testing equipment. Some €23 million has been spent on laboratory testing, and €14.5 million has been paid to general practitioners. The document shows that €371,000 has so far been spent on the HSE’s delayed Covid-19 tracing app. The costs of private labs are not yet included as contracts and payments schedules are being finalised. It also emerged that the State’s health watchdog warned the Department of Health in early April that 124 public and private nursing homes – a fifth of the country’s care homes - were “at risk” and could need additional support from the HSE to address outbreaks of Covid-19.Documents released to the Oireachtas committee show the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) told the department on April 9th “the lack of a direct relationship” between the HSE and private nursing homes would make it difficult to project the homes’ specific needs.Risk assessmentHiqa’s chief inspector Mary Dunnion told the department in a risk assessment that in a large number of private homes the “skills mix and competencies” of staff fell short of what was required to deal with the “escalating care needs of residents during a Covid-19 outbreak”.Meanwhile, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) confirmed another four deaths of people with Covid-19 in the State, the lowest daily number to be confirmed since March 11th. This brought the total number of deaths associated with the disease to 1,683. Another nine cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed, bringing the total to 25,207. While the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations has fallen, the average number of close contacts reported by those infected with the disease jumped to more than five.Speaking at the NPHET briefing, the State’s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, has said Irish people “can do better” when it comes to the wearing of face masks in public as part of an effort to suppress the spread of coronavirus.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Company got emails from fraudster who presented as machine\u0026rsquos Chinese supplierNo coronavirus-related deaths in Northern Ireland for third day in a row on TuesdayLocal group says Minister should resign for having \u0026lsquomisled\u0026rsquo public on suspected Covid-19 at hotelAnyone arriving into Northern Ireland from outside CTA must self-isolate for 14 daysChair of expert group says no strategy \u0026lsquoutterly insulates\u0026rsquo Ireland from the pandemicPoems to be read over the phone to combat isolation as part of Poetry Ireland initiativeUnexpected bounce in men measuring up for winter wedding suitsIsme chief: State agencies \u0026lsquoleave little doubt of perception that big business is good, small business is bad\u0026rsquoCovid-19 policing operation resulted in 82 charges or summonses being issued so farMost EU member states favour picking one unity nominee who bloc would then supportRepresentative groups reported unit was to be merged with a consultant-led sectionNiall Bradley allegedly distributed confidential information from HSE computer serversChief medical officer comments after four more deaths brings toll in State to 1,683Attraction says it believed it had all relevant approvals before Monday night\u0026rsquos guidanceLabour Court must reconsider complaint on factual evidence and in line with findingsApplications open for tables and chairs on streets amid concerns from disability groupsHospitality industry broadly welcomes new F\u0026aacuteilte Ireland guidance on how to reopen safelyDavid Crockett became well-known figure in media following the Brexit referendumMeasures should be deployed to \u0026lsquocrush\u0026rsquo the virus on all-island basis, says group of scientists and academicsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274428.1591719590!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus advice on face masks for ireland s over 60s to be reviewed this week committee hears","story":"The strategy laid out by Government is the right strategy to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, the chair of the Irish Epidemiology Modelling Advisory Group has told the special Oireachtas committee on the virus.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Cillian de Gascun said there was inequity for some people who could not afford to buy their own mask. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsGuidance that people over 60 should wear a face mask “seems like a practical approach” but it depends on the setting, the Covid-19 Oireachtas committee has been told.Director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory Dr Cillian de Gascun said the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) would review the advice issued this week by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that everyone over 60 should wear a face mask.Dr de Gascun said “we recommend them for people who are asymptomatic and for those who cannot maintain adequate physical distance at the moment such as on public transport”.He said earlier there was always a reluctance to make it mandatory for people to wear a mask but he acknowledged that the uptake was not as large as they thought for people to follow the recommendation in such situations.He said there is time to “scale up manufacturing capacity” to supply face coverings to households if there is a resurgence of coronavirus.Dr de Gascun said there was inequity for some people who could not afford to buy their own mask and acknowledged that it could be a good idea to supply masks, while maintaining supplies of medical grade masks for healthcare workers in clinical settings.Dr de Gascun pointed out, however, that the evidence for the wearing of cloth masks or non-medical grade masks “is not fantastic, to be honest. There’s a nice plausible hypothesis that people use that it stops the particles, that it’s trapping the virus as well. We don’t actually have great evidence in that area.”Labour TD Duncan Smith called for the Government to supply re-usable masks to every household in the country in light of the lifting of restrictions.Chair of the Irish Epidemiology Modelling Advisory Group Prof Philip Nolan warned however that there was a view that “if only we had testing and tracing and a face mask we could do all the other things we used to do”.He said that the best way to suppress the virus was to adhere to the public health guidance including maintaining social distancing.Government strategy The strategy laid out by Government is the right strategy to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, Prof Nolan told the committee earlier on Tuesday morning.Prof Nolan said that “different scientists have different judgments in the face of incomplete evidence”when asked about the open letter by dozens of Irish researchers calling for a policy rethink to crush Covid-19.He said the strategy is not one of mitigation or living with an ongoing or significant levels of transmission, but of suppression.The letter by leading scientists and epidemiologists called for stronger short-term measures to eliminate the virus.Prof Nolan said, however, that he fully supported the recommendations of the NPHET. “I support them and they accord with my judgment. No strategy utterly insulates us from the virus.”He told Fianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly that there will be renewed outbreaks of Covid-19 disease across Europe which would be in “small waves.”Prof Nolan told the committee that “the management of the second wave will be different from the first wave. There could be more targeted measures introduced to control future outbreak.”Asked by Mr Donnelly if Irish society will be fully functioning by the end of the year, Prof Nolan said, “I don’t have a crystal ball on this and could not give a probability on the likelihood”.“Our behaviour will continue to be modified by this virus for some time to come.”He said that when people talk about a second wave it “gives the impression that some overwhelming second wave will wash over” society.“It is probable that at some point in the future an incidence of the virus will increase again,” he said. There would be new outbreaks and public health care would be required to intervene and control.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274977.1591727273!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dial a poet cocooners to benefit from uplifting verse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSwineherd by Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin is one of the reassuring poems to be read on June 18th. Photograph: Eric LukeAs people continue to grapple with the emotional impact of the coronavirus pandemic, older people will have access to an unusual method of support through poetry.As part of an initiative by Poetry Ireland, iniduals who are cocooning can organise to receive a call at a preselected time during which two “reassuring and uplifting” poems will be read to them.The scheme, which will take place on June 18th, was developed in response to the current Covid-19 restrictions, and aims to provide connection through poetry at a time that can feel very isolating.Some of the poems being read over the phone include The Planter’s Daughter by Austin Clarke, Swineherd by Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin, Making Love Outside Áras an Uachtaráin by Paul Durcan and Lines Composed Upon Westminster Bridge by William Wordsworth.In the Wordsworth poem, the lines depict the calm and quiet of London City, which is similar to how Ireland appeared during the coronavirus restrictions.“Ne’er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep! The river glideth at his own sweet will: Dear God! The very houses seem asleep And all that mighty heart is lying still!”Swineherd by Ní Chuilleanáin hears the narrator imagining a better future, much like those longing for normality amid the pandemic.“When all this is over, said the swineherd, I mean to retire, where Nobody will have heard about my special skills And conversation is mainly about the weather.”Participants who are taking part can also choose to have a specific poem read to them if they prefer.Poet Mary O’Malley, one of the readers taking part in the poetry line, said she was “delighted to do it” and she hoped that the poems could provide comfort to some of the listeners.“There is no connection more immediate or visceral than language and people really need that at this time. When you’re in lockdown, things go into sharp relief,” Ms O’Malley said. “A lot of the very fine poems that I have read provided solace I hope that’s what we do. There is an uplift in solace.”Poetry Ireland previously held a similar initiative on Poetry Day on April 30th, which they said “greatly benefited” both the artists and the older people receiving the calls.In order to sign up, iniduals should contact Poetry Ireland’s dedicated Poetry Line at 01-2548856. A member of the team will take your name, phone number, preferred time slot and any particular poem requests, if you have one.This line is open for sign-ups 10am to 5pm and closes on Monday June 15th, with calls taking place on Thursday June 18th.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274896.1591723607!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"false start as tayto park postpones june 18th reopening","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTayto Park developer Ray Coyle with Cian Harty from Castlebar on the Cú Chulainn rollercoaster.

The Co Meath-based attraction announced on Wednesday morning that the park would admit visitors from June 18th. Such was the response, however, that its booking system was immediately overwhelmed and crashed. Ray Coyle, former owner of Tayto and developer of Tayto Park, said the management team had been “excited to reopen” the facility, as it believed it was entitled to do, having consulted the regulatory authorities over the past few days. But he said he was now “ terribly sorry, having reviewed the latest Government guidance for the roadmap to reopening Ireland, that it had become apparent the June 18th reopening could not take place”. Mr Coyle said that on reviewing statutory regulations “that were published late yesterday evening , is with regret that Tayto Park will have to remain closed until regulations permit us to reopen”. Rapidly expandedTayto Park has rapidly expanded over the last decade and is now one of the State’s premier attractions, incorporating the Cú Chulainn rollercoaster, a Viking village and circus and a zoo.

A new date for when Tayto Park can reopen is being ascertained. “We apologise to all of guests and members for this inconvenience.

Photograph: Kelvin BoyesPA WireNorthern Ireland’s Health Minister has criticised what he\u0026nbspcalled a lack of information from the Irish Government over its easing of lockdown restrictions, which he said puts the Northern Executive “where it seems that we should be playing catch-up”.Robin Swann said the Republic had “moved without giving us a lot of consultation as to their movements”, and that he had raised this with the Irish Government at a North-South meeting on Tuesday.He said while the “strategic decision that the Irish Government made in regards to last week and in regards to how they come out of their restrictions was one for them to make, we have asked that approaching the next date, there is more of an engagement to make sure we’re on similar pages, similar understanding”.He said he believed the Executive was taking a “measured, cautious approach” in its relaxation of the coronavirus restrictions.A spokesman for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, said he and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, did inform their Northern counterparts ahead of their announcement on Friday that the relaxation of some coronavirus-related restrictions would be accelerated.There has been criticism from industry bodies in the North that the pace of reopening has lagged behind that of the Republic.In particular, there have been calls to reopen hotels, pubs and restaurants in the North sooner than the indicative date of July 20th, which the hospitality industry has said will put it at a competitive disadvantage to similar businesses in the Republic, which can reopen at the end of June.Speaking at the Northern Executive’s daily coronavirus briefing on Tuesday, Mr Swann said the decision to bring forward the date would be a matter for the Executive when it meets on Thursday and he would not “pre-empt” this, though he also said one alternative could be a “cafe-style approach where people are outdoors”.The North’s Department of Health had earlier warned that sustained additional funding and investment is needed to rebuild Northern Ireland’s health service in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Framework documentThe department published a strategic framework document for rebuilding health and social care services in the North on Tuesday.“The department’s budgetary position continues to be hugely challenging, with the department facing a funding shortfall in respect of forecast inescapable pressures necessary to maintain existing services,” it said.The department recorded no coronavirus-related deaths in Northern Ireland for a third day in a row on Tuesday. A total of 702 tests were carried out in the last 24 hours, and three people had tested positive for the virus.The number of coronavirus-related fatalities reported by the department in the North remains at 537.The document also outlined the impact of coronavirus on the health service in the region, which had already been facing significant challenges, not least from long and growing waiting lists, before the coronavirus crisis began.Speaking in the Northern Assembly, Mr Swann said the percentage of patients receiving non-coronavirus-related hospital care has fallen by up to two-thirds in Northern Ireland.Waiting lists that had been “unacceptable” before Covid-19 were “even more horrendous now”, he said.“For instance, outpatient activity is down between 40 per cent and 55 per cent and inpatient activity by between 34 per cent and 67 per cent – both compared to the similar period last year,” he said.Cancer servicesThe North’s six hospital trusts also published plans on Tuesday setting out their proposals for resuming services in the immediate period to June 30th, while work has begun on resuming the full range of cancer services.The document warned that the impact of coronavirus on health and social care services will be “profound and long-lasting”, and services will not be able to resume as normal for some time due to the need to adhere to social distancing and for increased volumes of personal protective equipment (PPE).It also noted that coronavirus restrictions, while necessary, have “impacted on the wider economic and social environment, with both long- and short-term effects on population health”.“Emerging research indicates that population health is, on balance, likely to be negatively affected by the wider impacts of Covid-19,” and that the greatest effects were likely to be felt by the most disadvantaged.It also noted that the suspension of screening and testing programmes during the pandemic “will have resulted in some diseases going undetected or untreated longer than is desirable, with potential impact on long-term health outcomes”.The estimated backlog created by the suspension of breast and cervical cancer screening programmes is estimated at 12,800 mammograms and 45,000 cervical tests as of May 31st.Adverse impactUncertainty and concern over the pandemic and the impact of lockdown is also likely to have had an adverse impact on mental health, and there is likely to be a “significant need” in this area as Northern Ireland emerges from lockdown.Mr Swann said some innovations introduced during the lockdown would be retained. “Decisions were taken at pace, services were reconfigured, mountains were moved. Staff have worked across traditional boundaries time and time again,” he said.“I cannot thank them enough. We must build on that spirit in the months and years ahead. Innovations like telephone triage and video consultations will be embedded in primary and secondary care.”He did not want to “simply restore the health and social system to the way it was at the beginning of 2020”.“That would do a disservice to our great staff and the people of Northern Ireland. I honestly believe we can make it better.“That will require patience, careful planning, sustained investment and collective support – not just around the Executive table but across society as a whole.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274392.1591706145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no buffets mini bars or close dancing under post lockdown measures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere will  be no family-style service of food at weddings, ie no shared vegetable and gravy dishes. Photograph: iStock  Guests on the dance floor at weddings will be told to keep 2 metres apart under new post Covid-19 lockdown rules which will also see the end of mini-bars and self-service buffets in hotels.Guests in spas should also be offered express “stress management” treatments instead of therapies that involve touch, while those using hotel pools may be asked to book time slots in advance.For golfers, the space between tee times will be increased to 15-minute intervals. The guidelines also state that caddie service offered to guests must be suspended unless physical distancing can be adhered to.Restaurateurs are being asked to verbally tell customers what is on the menu while there will be no more sharing plates. Embellishments on drinks such as decorative cocktail umbrellas will have to be “minimised.” Tableside cooking should also be suspended if social distancing guidelines cannot be maintained.For hotel weddings, canapés will have to be served inidually and there will no more shared bowls of vegetables, gravy while condiments such as salt and pepper will be on request.Below are the key changes for hotel weddings, spas, golf and restaurants. Further guidance for pubs intending to operate as restaurants is set to be published in the coming days. The new recommendations are predicated on the current physical distancing guidance of 2 metres but public health officials are examining potentially reducing this to 1metre for the hospitality industry.The plans have been criticised by those in the food and beverage sector with the chief executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland Adrian Cummins saying under the current two metre guidelines around 90 per cent of restaurants will not be able to open on June 29th. If that was reduced to one metre Mr Cummins said that would enable 80 per cent of restaurants to open. On Monday Minister for Health Simon Harris said the National Public Health Emergency Team was re-examining the appropriateness of the two metre social distancing requirement for the hospitality sector. HotelsGuests will be asked to enter the property through doors that are automated or manually operated by an employee where possible. “Reception employees should encourage just one representative of each arriving group to approach the check-in desk while the others adhere to physical distancing measures.”If guests use bell service, “ask them to place their luggage on the ground. The bell service can then commence, after which the bell cart can be cleaned and disinfected.”The guidelines say that it will be the responsibility of supervisors and managers to ensure that guests do not congregate in groups.The guidelines add that buffets should be avoided.“Avoid buffet-style service, where possible. If it is required, maintain physical distancing by avoiding queuing systems and staggering guests’ access to the buffet. Employees must plate up and serve food.”Guidelines on rooms say extra pillows and blankets will be provided only if requested by a guest. Food delivered to the room should be set on a tray or trolley in the hallway and the “guest can then retrieve their own food and drinks.”Mini-bars will be replaced by room service. They “must have all loose product removed and the bar then be locked. Items can be made available upon request from room service.”After a guest has left, the guest linen must be removed in a tied bag. “When linen is removed from a bed and laundered, employees must wear the relevant protective items eg gloves and apron, when separating the linen.”Pens will be removed or replaced after each guest checks out.In bars and function rooms, the amount of seating and stools must be reduced and the capacity of outside smoking areas must be reviewed. Open bar snacks or finger food will be served to inidual guests and not shared by a table. Tableside cooking “must be suspended if physical distancing cannot be adhered to.”Jugs will no longer be available on counters according to the guidelines as those using the counter as a dining facility may not be from the same household.Hotel pools Viewing chairs and seating must be removed completely. The pool area must be pressure washed, cleaned and disinfected each night, the guidelines state. “A designated employee must ensure the maximum pool capacity is not exceeded. Alternatively, guests can book their preferred pool time.”Hotel golf Space between tee times will also be increased to 15-minute intervals. Only one player can travel in a cart unless accompanied by people who are part of the same household. The guidelines also state that guest caddie service offered to guests must be suspended unless physical distancing can be adhered to. Inidual scorecards and pencil sets should also be made be available to players.Hotel spa Instead of close contact treatments the guidelines suggest “alternative express treatments” such as “stress management and options that do not involve touch”. Ultraviolet treatment boxes must be installed to ensure that all grooming equipment has been properly sterilised. Where physical distancing cannot be reasonably practised, therapists must be “provided with appropriate personal protective equipment and safeguards such as screens, training and instruction. Above all, it must be emphasised that gloves are no substitute for good handwashing.”Hotel weddings Even the dance floor will be subjected to social distancing under the guidelines. They also recommend a private room for the drinks reception. Canapés must be in inidual portions. During the meal, salt and pepper shakers, butter dishes will be available only on request. There will also be “no family-style service of food, ie no shared vegetable and gravy dishes.” Wedding afters “must be served directly to each guest fully plated.” Social distancing will have to be maintained on the dance floor. There will be signage on tables and dance floors which must ask guests to respect physical distancing guidelines. Staff will be required to monitor and manage distancing.Restaurants Where food is served buffet-style, all items for guest use must be “inidually wrapped” or be a single serve item. “Common tongs or ladles must not be used and neither must common distribution containers from which guests help themselves.”Restaurants are advised to encourage bookings and give specific time slots for diners.When a group arrives at a restaurant to queue, only one member should be asked do so, the document states. “The others must adhere to physical distancing until the group can be seated.”“The amount of seating and stools must be reduced and guests must order from their seat wherever possible to reduce queues.”Straws must be inidually wrapped and the “embellishment” or decoration of glasses like cocktail umbrellas should be minimised.Fresh glasses will be used for every new drink and when pouring drinks employees must handle glasses by the stem or base.Verbal menus are also being encouraged. The guidelines state that menus must be single use or made of a material that can easily be cleaned. “Electronic menus, phone apps and menu boards are an alternative option. It may be possible to verbally recommend food and drinks to guests. If so, this should be done.”Sharing plates must be served in inidual portions from the kitchen. Self-service buffet and hotplates will have to be “shielded from guests” and only employees must plate up food.Buffet service “must only be provided where physical distancing and other public health advice can be followed. Maintain physical distancing by staggering service and placing 2metre markings on the floor to highlight distance if queuing is unavoidable.” But no self-serve food will be available.Bill tip trays, pens and all other reusable guest contact items “must be cleaned and disinfected after each use or used just once and disposed of.”Every restaurant should have “at least one lead worker representative charged with ensuring that Covid-19 measures are strictly adhered to in their workplace,” the documents state.Restaurants are being urged to implement phased shifts, schedule small teams and keep the same team combinations where possible to limit employee interaction. “This will assist should contact tracing be required.”Restaurant tables, seating and couches in public areas and other physical layouts will have to be arranged to ensure appropriate social distancing is adhered to. Employees will also be reminded to “stay at least 2metre away from guests and other employees whenever possible.”The guideline state that if restaurants cannot ensure that employees stay the recommended distance apart at all times “alternative protective measures must be put in place. For example, install physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards between employees.”Hand sanitiser dispensers, touchless whenever possible, must be placed at all restaurant entrances, at employee entrances and at specific points within the public areas of the restaurant. All hand sanitisers must have a minimum alcohol content of 60 per cent.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274863.1591720676!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"phil hogan confirms he is weighing bid to become wto chief","story":"The  European Commissioner for Trade and former Fine Gael TD Phil Hogan has confirmed his candidacy for the position of director general for the World Trade Organisation.

File photograph: Naoise CulhaneIreland’s EU Commissioner Phil Hogan has publicly confirmed he is considering putting himself forward as a candidate to be the next director-general of the World Trade Organization. Mr Hogan confirmed he had his eye on the job, as first reported by The , following a video conference of trade ministers from member states of the European Union, at which the vacancy was discussed. “Certainly I am exploring the option of being a candidate for the director-general of the WTO,” the trade commissioner told reporters. “I think that there is an important amount of work to be done to reform the organization, to make it more effective and efficient, but also to deal with many of the trade issues that are bedevilling the international community now arising from Covid-19.” A majority of EU member states favour picking one unity nominee who the bloc as a whole would throw its support behind, and hope to make a quick decision so that the post can be filled quickly after it becomes vacant in September. Nominations close on July 8th. Mr Hogan said he had discussed the issue with his counterpart, United States trade representative Robert Lighthizer, “some time ago”, and that the US favoured a candidate from a “developed country” but would not make a decision until a list of candidates was known. The vacancy arose following the shock early resignation of WTO director-general Roberto Azevêdo, amid global economic turmoil and after a difficult stand-off with Washington. If Mr Hogan is successful in his bid and leaves his current position, Ireland would need to nominate a new EU commissioner. Mr Hogan’s replacement may be put into a different portfolio to trade, a vital role during crunch talks between the EU and Britain to decide their post-Brexit relationship."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Lam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusDeath at Wuhan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowhistleblower hospital\u0026rsquo prompts wave of anger at hospital authoritiesSchools in deprived areas reported girls using newspapers and rags in attempt to manage periodAnnual vigil to mark Tiananmen Square massacre cancelled but activists still plan to rallyOfficials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedBejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Government pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4274925.1591724621!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk talking to eu about accelerating talks says mordaunt","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit supporters: The UK government will  soon publish plans for preparing Britain’s border operations for changes after the post-Brexit transition period. Photograph: Andrew TestaNew York TimesBritain wants to accelerate the pace of its negotiations with the European Union by changing the format of the talks, a cabinet office minister told MPs on Tuesday. Paymaster general Penny Mordaunt said any agreement must be in place before the end of the year so that businesses would have time to adapt to its terms.“There is no point in our arriving at an agreement at the 11th hour: we have to arrive at an agreement to enable it to be implemented and ratified, but also in order for our citizens and businesses to prepare. That is what is dictating the timetable, and that is why we must have renewed focus. We are talking to the EU about having a change of format – about how we can increase the pace of negotiations, get the focus where we need it to be, and get a deal done for both our sakes,” she said.‘Achingly pragmatic’Ms Mordaunt said the government would soon publish plans for preparing Britain’s border operations for changes after the end of the post-Brexit transition period. But she declined to give details and said officials were planning for all outcomes, including the possibility that no deal would be agreed.“It would be prudent and wise for us to prepare for every scenario, just as we have always done. We did so last year and then did not need to implement those preparations. I am confident that we cannot only come to an agreement but do so in a timeframe that gives people the time that they need to prepare and to understand. We are very aware of the other things that are going on in the world that form the backdrop to that. Our approach is going to be achingly pragmatic,” she said.Transition periodFormer Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith said that businesses in the North had told him they were moving jobs to the Republic because of the implications of the Northern Ireland protocol. The SDLP’s Claire Hanna drew the minister’s attention to last week’s vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly calling for an extension to the transition period.“The government insisted that the Northern Ireland Assembly should have the final say on the protocol. The Assembly finally gave a say on Brexit when it voted last week to request an extension to the transition period to allow businesses, which are currently in the fight of their lives due to Covid, to adapt and to have the certainty that the minister refers to. If the Northern Ireland Assembly’s consent is so vital, should the government not listen to what it says?” she said.Ms Mordaunt said that, although the Assembly would determine whether the terms of the protocol remain in force in a few years’ time, the government would not extend the transition.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Keep up to speed with The Briefing, The \u0026#39s two-minute audio updatesNeed a better way to keep up-to-date?

Times have changed since Little Britain first aired, so it is not currently available on BBC iPlayer.A BritBox spokeswoman also confirmed the show has been removed from that platform too.Last week, Netflix also removed the show, as well as Walliams and Lucas\u0027s other series Come Fly With Me.In that show Lucas wore dark make-up to play Jamaican woman Precious and ground crew employee Taaj, who was of Pakistani descent.Lucas has since said he has regrets about Little Britain, describing the comedy as cruel.He told The Big Issue: If I could go back and do Little Britain again, I wouldn\u0027t make those jokes about transvestites. I wouldn\u0027t play black characters.Basically, I wouldn\u0027t make that show now. It would upset people. We made a more cruel kind of comedy than I\u0027d do now.Society has moved on a lot since then and my own views have evolved.

Please remember to leave your signs here so that the university and stakeholders remember that we are here.One speaker links colonial history to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.Oxbridge has entrenched vast racial inequality, an activist adds, before demanding that all Oxford University staff are paid the living wage.The crowd shows no sign of abating, with impassioned speeches continuing to be made from outside the college.A speech calls on the University of Oxford to consider its reputation in light of the statue, which is behind a cage, continuing to stand.The vice president of the Oxford Student Union for graduates, Neil Misra - who is also a member of Oriel College - has supported the removal of the statue.He said: It is the student union\u0027s position that such a racist and imperialist symbol has no place on the front facade of Oriel College.The statue is an affront to our students of colour and our university community. He added that the statue is repugnant.Another protester says that the unfair, unjust racist system pervades in our society and the rest of the world.The numbers on the petition for the Rhodes statue to fall have surged since the start of the protest - with more than 113,000 people now giving the petition their backing.It\u0027s a self-evident truth. We have a system, a history of white supremacy that has denigrated and exploited black lives, says a former student as he addresses the crowd.This movement started in Oxford not because of students of colour at this university. Demonstrators hold placards during a protest for the removal of a statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes on the outside of Oriel College in Oxford.It\u0027s about responsibility. It\u0027s about liberating the university, Cllr Djafari-Marbini tells the crowd.She speaks of a very clear racial hierarchy and the legacy of deaths as a result of imperialist attitudes.Activists boo the mention of British politicians and there are further boos when Prime Minister Boris Johnson is referred to by name.Dr Hosnieh Djafari-Marbini, one of Oxford\u0027s Labour city councillors, has taken to the podium to address the crowd.I\u0027m going to give the college a message from the Council - please apply for planning permission to have the statue removed, she says.Chants of shame at you are then directed by the crowd at the university.Elsewhere, a statue of King Leopold II of Belgium has been taken down in Antwerp today.Leopold owned the Belgian Congo as his personal property from 1885 to 1908, exploiting the country\u0027s rubber reserves in what some regard as a genocide.The Rhodes Must Fall campaign group, alongside other students, argue that Oxford has \u0026#34failed to address its institutional racism\u0026#34.We are not asking you, we are telling you that this does not represent Oxford, one protester says.We will beg no more. We want it down. We are an antiracist city and we want it down.Don\u0027t be fooled, Rhodes was a racist, one speaker says, with the crowd enthusiastically applauding. References are made to Rhodes\u0027 colonial legacy, and his role in expanding the British Empire in Africa.The atmosphere is good-natured, with a sense of urgency to the cause.Demonstrators gather outside University of Oxford\u0026#39s Oriel College during a protest called by the Rhodes Must Fall campaign on June 09, 2020 in Oxford, Protesters now number at least into the hundreds, carrying signs including the slogans Down with Rhodes and post-colonial attitudes matter.The drone of police helicopters in the grey skies can be heard overhead, as the silence to commemorate Floyd comes to an end, followed by rapturous applause.Eight minutes and thirty six seconds, an activist says, before leading chants of no justice, no peace, a mantra adopted by Black Lives Matter activists on both sides on the Atlantic, and decolonise.A silence is currently taking place in Oxford in memory of George Floyd, whose funeral was today and whose death sparked the Black Lives Matter protest movement across the UK, the US and elsewhere.Activists are taking the knee - a gesture that has become synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement.Members of the crowd are also raising their fists as they sit in silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds - to remember the length of time Floyd had pressure applied to his neck. Footage from the BBC shows that protesters have started to gather at the College, where energetic chants of take it down are being repeated by the crowd, most of whom are wearing face masks. Signs made by protesters include decolonise Oxford Uni and decolonise in my lifetime. Two police officers in masks are stood outside the College.Oxford City Council leader Susan Brown said in a statement today that she supports the Black Lives Matter movement, and has a great deal of sympathy with the Rhodes Must Fall campaign.The question of statues and their historical context is not a simple matter, but sometimes acts of symbolism are important.As a city council we are keen to work with Oriel to help them find the right balance between the laws that protect our historic buildings and the moral obligation to reflect on the malign symbolism of this statue.Oriel College declined to comment on the letter when approached by PA, and pointed to a statement that said it supported the right to peaceful protest, and that the college would strive to improve its practices.The statue was previously the subject of a campaign by hundreds of Oxford students in 2016, who campaigned for the removal of the statue and a more erse curriculum.Oxford University insisted that the statue would stay, with modifications that “draw attention to this history”. It had been warned that it could lose up to £100 million in gifts were the statue to be taken down, but insisted financial motives did not guide its decision.26 Oxford councillors are now among those calling for the disposal of the Rhodes statue. These include Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon.“The statues of white supremacists and slave merchants should not still be standing in our cities,” she said.Today’s protest comes after several days of Black Lives Matter (BLM) demonstrations in the UK.The demonstrations were inspired by mass protests in the US following the death of George Floyd, who died after former police officer Derek Chauvin dug his knee into his neck.During Sunday’s BLM demonstration in Bristol, a statue of Edward Colston - a merchant and slave trader in the 17th and 18th Centuries - was knocked down and dumped in a harbour.Protesters dragging the statue of Edward Colston to Bristol harbourside during a Black Lives Matter protest rally in memory of George Floyd who was killed on May 25 while in police custody in the US city of MinneapolisThe Home Secretary Priti Patel told the House of Commons that a total of 137,000 Britons attended Black Lives Matter protests across the UK last weekend.Rhodes was a 19th-century mining magnate and politician, who believed that whites were a superior race and held imperialist views. He has been labelled an “architect of apartheid”.He was responsible for the expansion of the British Empire in southern Africa in the late 19th Century, including the annexation of Zimbabwe and Zambia - which were formerly named Northern and Southern Rhodesia respectively.Rhodes is reviled by many who see him as a symbol of colonialism, with critics believing he was a racist figure.

Among medical staff, the proportion was 30 per cent.The study suggests that the area may be approaching herd immunity levels – experts suggest the threshold for achieving herd immunity against coronavirus may be around 60-65 per cent.The idea of herd immunity is that if a certain percentage of the population is immune to an infectious disease, the disease will stop spreading.Testing has shown that around 17 per cent of London’s population now has Covid-19 antibodies, while the figure for the rest of the country is 5 per cent.In New York City, around 25 per cent of the population has tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.Blood testing in Spain revealed that 5 per cent of the overall population has antibodies, with the figure rising to 7 per cent in Barcelona and 11 per cent in Madrid. In Stockholm, around 7 per cent of people have developed antibodies to Covid-19.Several studies suggest that people who have been infected with Covid-19 gain some degree of immunity, although it is not clear for how long.Bergamo is in the northern region of Lombardy, where more than 16,000 people have lost their lives to the virus – nearly half Italy’s total of 34,000 fatalities.Italy has recorded 235,000 infections, of which 35,000 people are still infected.Bergamo became a chilling symbol of Italy’s battle against the virus when a convoy of army trucks had to be drafted in to remove more than 60 coffins full of bodies from the city’s overwhelmed cemetery.In a report last month, Italy’s national statistics agency said the number of overall deaths in Bergamo had jumped by 568 per cent in March, compared with previous years.That made it by far the worst affected part of Italy.Population density and atmospheric pollution have been posited for the high number of infections and deaths in Lombardy.There are other factors – the region is renowned for its manufacturing, with many businesses having commercial links with China, where the virus originated.Despite Italy declaring a strict national lockdown in early March, many people in the industrious region continued to go to work, with mobile phone data suggesting up to 40 per cent of people were out and about.Lombardy is still discovering hundreds of new cases a week, but the aggressive nature of the virus may be diminishing, experts said.“Something has happened in terms of the aggressiveness of the virus,” said Sergio Harari, an expert in pneumology from San Giuseppe Hospital in Milan. “We don’t know whether it’s something in the viral load or whether it’s a mutation.”While Lombardy and other northern regions emerge slowly from the emergency, several of Italy’s 20 regions are recording no new cases, including Sardinia, Umbria, Valle d’Aosta, Molise, Abruzzo, Calabria and Basilicata.Italy has begun rolling out a contact-tracing app called Immuni that people can download to their mobile phones.The app enables users to find out whether they have come into contact with someone infected with Covid-19.If they have, they would undergo tests and self-quarantine to stop the spread of the virus.Testing of the app has started in four regions – Puglia, Abruzzo, Liguria and Marche – and has been downloaded two million times.The more people download the app, the more chance there is of them being notified if they come into contact with a positive case, said Paola Pisano, the minister for innovation. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prioritising betting shops schools government shows exit strategy","story":"As a father of six, Boris Johnson could reasonably be expected to be well versed in the trials and tribulations of raising school-age children, even if his youngest is still a babe in arms.Yet the latest Government u-turn on reopening schools to all primary children for a month before the summer holidays suggests Downing Street may have mislaid its Mumsnet log-in details.For there are now fears that secondary pupils might not return even in September, despite mounting concerns about the detrimental impact on pupil progress.Having announced that non-essential retail — including betting shops — will re-open from Monday June 15, it seems children have been pushed down No 10’s list of priorities. As Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, succinctly put it when she pointed out the ridiculousness of theme parks re-opening before schools: “Children’s education does matter as much as the economy, We need to invest in it because without that there’s a risk that childhood is just going to be furloughed.”With a YouGov poll finding on Monday that two thirds of parents were “struggling to maintain discipline and motivation” while home-schooling during the crisis, the Government’s exit strategy doesn’t appear particularly family focused. This is despite a poll by the National Foundation for Educational Research finding that more than half of parents were willing to send their children back when they open more fully. As many Tories who have supported schools reopening have been at pains to point out — only when children are back in school can parents properly return to work.Conservative MP Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons education select committee, on Tuesday warned of an epidemic of educational poverty if children do not get back into the classroom sooner.It followed an admission by Health Secretary Matt Hancock at Monday’s Downing Street press conference that secondary schools would not reopen until September “at the earliest” despite saying coronavirus was “in retreat” across the UK.The over cautious approach angered MPs and ministers in light of the World Health Organisation’s recommendation that schools should reopen — with no evidence of spikes among school children in countries that have allowed them to return to class. Last month, a video conference of education ministers from around the EU heard the reopening of schools in 22 European countries had not led to any significant increase in coronavirus infections among children, parents or staff.Denmark became the first European country to tentatively reopen its nurseries, kindergartens and primary schools on 15 April, followed by Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece and France. Schools will remain closed until September in Italy and only partially reopened in Spain.So why does the Government appear to be turning a blind eye not only to the needs of children but also the scientific evidence?One senior Tory blamed the climb-down squarely on Gavin Williamson, saying the Education Secretary had “done a Ted Heath” by caving into the unions. Unions including the National Education Union, the National Association of Headteachers, and Naswut remain unconvinced that it is safe for schools to reopen, and a number of Labour-run councils have refused to allow pupils to return. “Gavin’s not just kowtowed to the unions but also ‘the Blob’,” said the MP.“The civil servants in the Department for Education are best described as well-meaning Lib Dems. It’s not that they’re left wing, they’re just mushy. He’s clearly been persuaded by them.”The capitulation is all the more surprising considering it was Mr Johnson\u0027s chief adviser Dominic Cummings who advised Michael Gove to take on the unions when he was his special advisor to the former Education Secretary from 2011 to 2014. Yet according to another senior Tory: “This is all a result of the Government having no clear strategic view on where they want to be. Betting shops re-opening but not schools? They announced that all primary school children would return for a month before the school holidays without thinking of answers to the questions that would inevitably arise. They needed to bring parents on board but all this retreat does is make them even more wary of sending their children back. Other European countries have got on with it, why can’t we?”On Wednesday evening, a source close to Mr Williamson insisted the ambition to have all primary school children to return before the summer holidays was only if it was feasible to so, adding: It was always subject to review.Denying he had surrendered to the unions or \u0027the Blob, the source added: If he had caved in, we wouldn\u0027t have more than 70 per cent of schools reopened right now.

The prosecutor should explain his point of view to them, because they do not know.”In Germany, it emerged today that Nicole Fehlinger, a reported ex-girlfriend who he stayed with in Portugal, had been interviewed by police nine months ago.Brückner and Fehlinger are known to be close, and she accepted the convicted paedophile into her home in the months after Madeleine’s disappearance.Speaking to the , Mr Janosch Gonzálezsaid he was confident the van belonged to Brückner.“The satellite images depend on the definition and perspective, so it was very difficult to do an exact analysis, but the measures and proportions, the location of the windshield, correspond well to a VW T3 Westaflia campervan,” he said.“I sent an email at midnight on Sunday and got a reply at 6.30am on Monday, so I think they were interested. They asked me how I got the pictures and I told them it was open source from Nasa.“I have always had an interest in this case, and have degrees in psychology and criminology, so when I heard about the farmhouse I wanted to look into it.”In the months after Madeleine’s disappearance, the prime suspect turned up at a restaurant in a remote village 40 miles from Praia da Luz asking for a job.There, he knew Nicole Fehlinger, a foster carer who looked after vulnerable German children.On Tuesday, her father Dieter said: If I had known then what I know about Christian now I would have killed him.When I first met him I was certainly suspicious of him.My daughter was interviewed by German police between nine months and a year ago in connection with Christian.I don\u0027t think she will be making any further comment.He added that Nicole also had a young blonde daughter living there at the time Bruckner was in the area.The news comes as British victims of sexual assaults in the Algarve were urged to contact police, after an Irish woman said that her rape could be linked to the man suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann.Braunschweig state prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said that German authorities believe Christian Brückner has committed more crimes against British, Irish and American tourists and that any new information could help with their investigation.An Irish woman who was raped in a nearby town in 2004 said that her attacker, who has never been found, spoke English with a German accent and had blonde hair and piercing blue eyes — all of which match the description of Brückner.The victim, Hazel Behan, was working as a holiday rep in Praia da Rocha at the time, and told the  that her information was now being taken seriously by the politan Police and that they would be in touch with Portuguese officials.The German paedophile has been convicted of raping a 72-year-old American tourist at a luxury beachfront villa in Praia da Luz in 2005, and has a long history of sexual assaults against women and children.On Tuesday, police in Germany announced they are reviewing the disappearance of yet another German girl in light of the new Madeleine suspect. Police in Bayreuth, a small German town just outside of Nuremberg, confirmed that Brückner is “under investigation” in the case of Peggy Knobloch, who disappeared without trace on May 7 2001 on her way home from school. On July 2, 2016, parts of her skeleton were discovered in the Thuringian Forest. Although there is currently no evidence that the suspect in the \u0027Maddie\u0027 case is also a possible perpetrator in the \u0027Peggy\u0027 case, Bayreuth\u0027s chief public prosecutor Martin Dippold told the German newspaper Bild: He is now also under investigation in the case \u0027Peggy\u0027.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two metre rule left draft government guidance reopening pubs","story":"The two-metre rule has been omitted from draft guidance on reopening pubs and restaurants, it has emerged.Instead, the Government proposals refer to wider spacing between customers and installing safeguarding measures, raising the prospect that officials are preparing to change the rule.The hospitality industry is waiting for the Government to issue its updated guidance on how venues can reopen.A draft of the guidance seen by Propel, the hospitality industry newsletter, encourages staff to split into shift teams and the use of radios or telephones or other electronic devices when sending orders from service areas to kitchens. However, no specific requirement on the distance required between tables has been stipulated in the document, which instead makes reference to wider spacing and the use of screens and barriers where appropriate.Previously, Government guidance for restaurants said: Provide where possible for two-metre social distancing. It added that venues should provide floor marking to signal distances of two metres.On Tuesday night, a Tory MP welcomed the proposed change. The MP said guiding venues to keep people at distance instead of specifying two metres is what we need to do, adding: If businesses can boost capacity and break even, that means they can keep going.  Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, repeatedly declined to say on Tuesday whether the Government is planning to reduce the two-metre rule before restaurants and pubs are allowed to reopen. He told the Downing Street press conference that the rule remains under review, adding: When it is safe to do so, we will see whether you can move to a shorter distance.There are other countries in the world that have moved from two metres to closer distances. Of course, they are further along in terms of their road map, in terms of opening up businesses.Mr Sharma said pubs, bars, restaurants and hairdressers will not be able to reopen until July 4 at the earliest.Venues will be asked to define the maximum number of customers that can reasonably follow social distancing, according to the draft guidance. This would need to take into account total indoor and outdoor space, specific venue characteristics such as furniture, as well as likely pinch points and busy areas. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has been urged to ditch the two-metre rule for restaurants and pubs or risk venues not being able to reopen.On Monday, UK Hospitality wrote to the Prime Minister warning that specifying a two-metre rule would mean venues only being able to generate 30 per cent of normal revenues and urged him to halve it.The difference between the two is the avoidance of mass redundancies and a quicker withdrawal of furlough as revenues return to normal more quickly, the letter to Mr Johnson says.Cutting the rule to one metre would significantly safeguard jobs, the trade body told The .Chief executive Kate Nicholls said: Opening with a two-metre social distancing rule would see many venues operating at around 30 per cent capacity, which would be completely unviable for almost every business.Reducing the distance to one metre would allow businesses to operate at around 70 per cent capacity, which might allow them to at least break even.Asked about the draft guidance, a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: We are working at pace to develop safe ways for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes to reopen at the earliest opportunity it is safe to do so, through our pubs and restaurants taskforce.This work is progressing well, bringing together representatives from the industry to develop guidance as we have done for other businesses and sectors.Pub landlords have welcomed the apparent change in policy. Stosie Madi ,who runs the Parker\u0027s Arms in the Ribble Valley, Lancashire, said: “A 2m rule cuts our numbers by 50 per cent, it’s not fair for anyone especially not for our industry.The general public would like some guidance on what would be safe, but we know that more than 1m is going to be very bad for us, we will not be able to make a profit, keep staff or employ people if we only have a 2m rule.Heath Ball who runs the Red Lion and Sun in Highgate added that he believed the rules would become \u0027self-policing\u0027, and explained: They seem to be saying now off you go, do what you like, we want people to go back to work so we can stop paying furlough.“The onus should really be on the customer, if you are concerned then don’t go to a pub, most pubs in this country can’t afford to operate with reduced numbers. It is at their own risk.The spokesman added that all public health guidance is under constant review to ensure that it reflects the latest scientific advice.The Government\u0027s ambition is to reopen pubs, cafes, bars and restaurants from July 4 at the earliest, subject to the scientific advice at the time.On Tuesday, the Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said the Government\u0027s position was that the two-metre rule should remain in place but added that it would be kept under review.Asked whether the rule had been discussed on Tuesday, the spokesman said that Cabinet had talked about the road map that sets out the easing of lockdown measures.On Tuesday, Nicola Sturgeon pledged to maintain the two-metre social distancing rule in Scotland.The First Minister said: I\u0027ve not seen anything they\u0027ve had that would advise a change in the two-metre rule right now. In fact, on the contrary, most of the advice that I see says that the two-metre rule should be maintained.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/09/09/mars-jupiter-saturn.jpg","title":"alien life planet dust habitable stars exoplanet climate met office","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Planets that had been written off as uninhabitable could in fact be more likely to serve as home for life than previously thought, research indicatesDust could represent a major clue to whether other planets are inhabitable by alien life, scientists have found.Airborne dust on those planets appears to be a key factor in deciding the conditions on such a planet, and whether they would be right to support life.But it could also cover up signs of life from other planets, meaning that we miss just how habitable they could be as we look around the universe in search of other worlds.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThose planets that have large amounts of such airborne dust would be habitable even when they are further from their star, the new research suggests. That in turn would mean those planets would theoretically be better as a home for life elsewhere in the universe.The dust changes the climates of the planets so that they would be better able to deal with the extreme and critical conditions that are found throughout the universe.How to see Mars, Saturn and Jupiter in the night sky this weekThe discovery suggests that planets that might have been written off as homes for life, because of their conditions, might in fact be better at supporting it than scientists had previously thought.And the researchers behind the new paper, published in Nature Communications, urged those scouring the universe for such planets to ensure that they look for dust as a potentially key marker of whether a planet is habitable.Many of the planets that are found as possible homes for alien life orbit stars smaller and cooler than our sun, known as M-dwarfs, and do so in synchronised rotation-orbit states, so that it is always day on one side of the planet and night on the other. That poses a major issue for any life, since it means that each side of the planet is likely to have more extreme conditions.However, researchers found that large amounts of airborne dust could cool the hotter side, where it is always day, as well as warming the colder night side. That means that the planet\u0027s could be more easily inhabited, since there is a wider range of distance from the star where water could exist, which is thought to be one of the key tests for life.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But these \u0027synchronised orbit\u0027 planets are very different, said Ian Boutle, lead author of the study and jointly from the Met Office and the University of Exeter.Here, the dark sides of these planets are in perpetual night, and the warming effect wins out, whereas on the dayside, the cooling effect wins out. The effect is to moderate the temperature extremes, thus making the planet more habitable.Even on planets that have orbits like those on Earth, airborne dust could help cool any worlds that are at the inner edge of the habitable zone, where any extra heat could mean that the surface water is lost and they become uninhabitable.The scientists, from the University of Exeter, the Met Office and the University of East Anglia, urged researchers to look for the presence of dust in the same way they search for other biomarkers that could indicate life. They also warned that the same thing keeping those worlds habitable could also stop us seeing them properly.Airborne dust is something that might keep planets habitable, but also obscures our ability to find signs of life on these planets, said Manoj Joshi from UEA. These effects need to be considered in future research.Scientists found the results by simulating Earth-sized exoplanets, using climate models that allowed them to see how naturally occuring dust would change the conditions on those worlds.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Demand is rising yet progress is stalling, with a growing gap between total applications and agreed loans.”A scheme for larger businesses, called CLBILS, has lent £1.6bn to 244 firms from 615 applicants.“Despite ministers\u0027 promises that bounce back loans would help, 60 per cent of larger businesses are rejected or languishing in the queue. An effective scheme is crucial for Britain\u0027s manufacturing sector but many have been locked out by technical Treasury rules, which must change,” Mr Miliband said.“Many businesses have been facing severe difficulty for months now. They cannot afford to wait any longer for support.”The news comes as applications are set to close for the furlough scheme.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Twice as many people expected to see a drop in prices than those who thought property in their area would increase in value.However, this could be a positive development for first-time buyers and those looking to climb the property ladder.  The travel industry also has some positives after a torrid six months, with one in 10 people admitting they had missed their foreign trips so much they were planning on going away more than they did last year.Of the 2,600 surveyed by OnePoll, 495 identified themselves as managers, directors, or business owners.More than half of this group said they expected their business to come out of the pandemic the same or better than it was last year.  And four in 10 expected their business to come out worse, while 1 per cent feared going bankrupt or being forced to close.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Demand is rising yet progress is stalling, with a growing gap between total applications and agreed loans.”A scheme for larger businesses, called CLBILS, has lent £1.6bn to 244 firms from 615 applicants.“Despite ministers\u0027 promises that bounce back loans would help, 60 per cent of larger businesses are rejected or languishing in the queue. An effective scheme is crucial for Britain\u0027s manufacturing sector but many have been locked out by technical Treasury rules, which must change,” Mr Miliband said.“Many businesses have been facing severe difficulty for months now. They cannot afford to wait any longer for support.”The news comes as applications are set to close for the furlough scheme.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The latest study, which involved 2,254 British adults, also revealed that around six in 10 people experienced worse sleep since lockdown began on 23 March.Charting Sweden’s no lockdown strategy“Nearly two-thirds of the UK public report some negative impact on their sleep from the Covid-19 crisis, clearly showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been for a very large proportion of us,” said Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London.“And this is clearly tied to both how stressful we’ve found the virus itself, and how much we fear the impact of the lockdown on our employment and finances.”Data gathered in April by wearable technology firm Withings showed that people in the UK had been sleeping for 15 minutes longer on average each day during the lockdown.France saw the biggest increase in daily sleep times, with the average person sleeping for an extra 20 minutes each night.These findings can be partly explained by people not having to commute to work due to either working from home or not working at all during lockdown.Similar data from fitness tracking firm Polar revealed that people in Germany are also sleeping for longer.A significant increase in sleep time was recorded by Polar’s sleep-tracking devices as lockdown measures were introduced in Germany on 22 March.Researchers at University College London (UCL) are currently studying the effects lockdowns are having on people’s mental health.Early results suggest that higher levels of anxiety and depression are linked to lockdown restrictions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers have been unable to find how the bursts could be created, with the only certainty being that the very short but very powerful blasts must be emerging from some unknown, very extreme part of the universe.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe bursts come in a roughly 90 day window, which is then followed by a silent period for 67 days. The pattern then repeats, leaving a reliable 157 day period that was tracked over multiple years.That long pattern could suggest that the blasts are linked to the swirling, orbital motion of a massive star, a neutron star or a black hole.Mysterious signals coming from space answer matter puzzleThis is an exciting result as it is only the second system where we believe we see this modulation in burst activity, said Kaustubh Rajwade of The University of Manchester, who led the new research. Detecting a periodicity provides an important constraint on the origin of the bursts and the activity cycles could argue against a precessing neutron star.Fast radio bursts were first discovered in 2007, and were initially thought to be the result of a one-off event. Scientists then found in 2016 that FRB 121102 was in fact repeating.In the latest research, scientists then studied the source of the FRB using telescopes at Jodrell Bank, which allowed for regular monitoring over a long period that revealed the blast could be seen to be coming in a repeating patter when watched for a long time.This result relied on the regular monitoring possible with the Lovell Telescope, and non-detections were just as important as the detections, said Benjamin Stappers, who leads the MeerTRAP project to hunt for FRBs using the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, in a statement.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The travel industry also has some positives after a torrid six months, with one in 10 people admitting they had missed their foreign trips so much they were planning on going away more than they did last year.Of the 2,600 surveyed by OnePoll, 495 identified themselves as managers, directors, or business owners.More than half of this group said they expected their business to come out of the pandemic the same or better than it was last year.  And four in 10 expected their business to come out worse, while 1 per cent feared going bankrupt or being forced to close.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I don’t care if I lose fans and I already know that some people who have posted have lost a lot of fans and I just think it’s disgusting, but it just proves what we’re saying.”Jennifer Lawrence: America’s Sweetheart in the digital age Pinnock said that she first spoke openly about her experiences with racism in 2019, but “didn’t feel like enough people cared”. She said that she was so “overwhelmed” by Floyd’s death that she felt she should reiterate them.“Now I just feel like people are starting to understand and educate themselves and see that this problem is massive and we need to talk about it and there needs to be a change because we just can’t go on like this anymore,” she explained. “Four hundred years of oppression, it just can’t go on anymore.”She continued: “It’s actually been such a weight lifted for me. I was hearing from people who have been in the same sort of experiences that I have, so being the black girl in their band in the pop industry, saying how they felt exactly the same way as me and I’ve never ever had conversations with people who have had similar experiences as me.”Stars including Normani, formerly of Fifth Harmony, and Shaznay Lewis, of All Saints, tweeted their support for Pinnock’s statements.In response to Pinnock, her Little Mix bandmate Jade Thirlwall condemned media outlets for confusing the pair in images.“This s*** happens ALL THE TIME,” Thirlwall wrote. Highlighting an article about Pinnock that used an image of Thirlwall to illustrate it, she added: “You might want to make sure you’re using an image of the correct mixed race member of the group.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Times have changed since Little Britain first aired so it is not currently available on BBC iPlayer.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLittle Britain has repeatedly come under fire in recent years for its reliance on blackface and yellowface for humour. Both Walliams and Lucas dressed up as black and Asian women for the series, playing characters including an overweight Caribbean woman and a mail order bride named Ting Tong.Other recurring characters have been accused of being ableist and transphobic.BBC’s Big Night In – a joy marred by Little Britain’s racist returnPiers Morgan tells ‘stupid and racist’ people to stop watching GMBIn May, a Little Britain sketch for the BBC’s Big Night In drew 180 complaints, specifically a joke in which a character said he wanted to eat a bat – itself a reference to conspiracy theories about the origins of coronavirus.In 2017, Lucas said that a Little Britain reboot would have to be radically different as it would “upset a lot of people” if it came back exactly the same. He acknowledged that the show made jokes that would no longer be acceptable.While reports in March claimed that Netflix and the BBC were in a tug of war over the mooted Little Britain revival, something teased by both Walliams and Lucas in recent months, fresh controversy over its humour may have cast doubt over its return.The ongoing international protests against systemic racism and police brutality have further shone a spotlight on racist entertainment and stars previously accused of racism.Mark Wahlberg’s history of racially motivated attacks as a teenager resurfaced after he came out in support of Black Lives Matter, while The Flash actor Hartley Sawyer was fired from the series after the unearthing of racist tweets.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We need leaders like yourselves to help bridge this gap of disconnection, misinformation, and complacency.”The employees also made a list of suggestions the executives could implement:Condemn the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and flashbangs on peaceful protestorsCancel Microsoft contracts with the Seattle Police Department and other law enforcement organisationsSupport defunding and demilitarisating of the police departmentSign the petition for the resignation of Mayor DurkanSupport Black Lives Matter Seattle’s List of DemandsEnsure that employees with reduced productivity because of COVID-19 will not be penalised in annual performance reviewsAlthough the original email was sent on behalf of only 20 employees, it quickly spread through the company with hundreds more asking to be included.Dozens of Zuckerberg-funded scientists attack FacebookTech giants provide ‘essential services’ to US blacklisted firms All the biggest announcements from Microsoft Build 2020“Those who choose to support the movement in ways other than boots-on-the-ground protests have also suffered the results of the SPD response,” wrote one in an email thread reportedly seen by OneZero.“Tear gas streams into apartments through cracks in the wall as far as a mile away. The sound of flashbangs and fired tear gas canisters reverberates through the night, past 2–3am most days this week, including last night. Worse yet is the fear and stress that these employees are dealing with fear that has been compounded by SPD’s ever-escalating response.”That same employee also said that they had been tear gassed three times, hit with a flashbang once, and mentioned a video that showed another company employee being put into a chokehold by Seattle police.Microsoft is not the only technology company to have employees ask for greater action from company leaders Facebook employees staged a walkout over the company’s decision not to take action against inflammatory posts made by Donald Trump about the death of George Floyd. with employees saying they are “caught in an abusive relationship” with the president.IBM today also took the decision not to develop facial recognition software following the protests, because that technology discriminates against minority faces and can be used to disproportionately target communities of colour.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Very little is being done behind the scenes. Unfortunately, Hollyoaks’ response seems to me performative and disingenuous.“Working at Hollyoaks is mostly positive, but the experiences I have encountered are a constant reminder of how difficult it is being a black woman in the industry,” she added. “I am no longer standing for it.”Responding to the former X Factor contestant, Hollyoaks wrote on their Instagram page: “Hollyoaks has zero tolerance on racism.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

How Boris Johnson dropped his promise to reject US chlorinated chickenGovernment ready to open British markets to chlorinated chickenUS negotiators have made clear that opening the door to American agricultural exports, which are produced to much lower welfare standards than their European counterparts, is their primary demand in talks with the UK.While the government’s own best-case scenario shows an agreement with the US would lead to a tiny boost to the UK economy of just 0.16 per cent of GDP, failing to sign such a deal would be highly politically embarrassing for Boris Johnson, who has presented such an arrangement as part of the alternative to EU membership.Selaine Saxby, Conservative MP for North Devon, said during a question session in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon that “a large number of farmers and constituents” had contacted her concerned about food standards.“Can my right honourable friend assure me and my constituents that we will maintain our current food standards and prevent the import of chlorinated chicken and other inferior food?” she asked.Penny Mordaunt replied: “I think in this we should be trusting the consumer. If people don’t want to put their faith in government we should trust the consumer. I think consumers want high quality, fairly priced foods with high-quality animal welfare standards.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The communication, to MPs, said the UK was “firmly committed to upholding our high environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards outside the EU”.But the National Farmers’ Union warned that the letter was open to interpretation and that the assurances provided “no safeguards” if “we have a concern about the animal welfare or environmental impact of a certain production method”, according to trade publication The Grocer.Downing Street signalled last Thursday that imports of lower-standard American food were now on the table in the negotiations, a reversal of a longstanding promise.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman looks on during a protest against the killing of George Floyd in Osaka city, western Japan.

It was reported last week that the UK is going to take a “dual tariff” approach to the imports, allowing American meats in even if they do not meet some British production standards, but also charging tariffs.If US food exports do make it to the UK, British consumers may be denied information about which products are American to help them get a foothold in the market. The US government’s “Foreign Trade Barriers” document for 2019 catalogues policies in countries around the world the US wants ended. The document says the US has “consistently raised concerns” about country of origin labelling at the World Trade Organisation, notably because of “the potential to favour select countries, and the impact on US exports”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He cried out, ‘The child is dead now and that’s a good thing’, then he said: ‘You can make a body disappear quickly. Pigs also eat human flesh’.”Christian B is currently eligible for parole having served two-thirds of his sentence for drug offences - but German legal experts say it is unlikely to go through as he is under investigation for murder.Follow our live blog below for all the latest news and updates.Portuguese prosecutors have confirmed Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B has two convictions in the country.It was reported last week that the -year-old had served prison sentences in Portugal, but authorities have now confirmed his criminal record.There had been no official recognition of media reports about the suspect’s criminal record in the country.Last night prosecutors took the unusual step of confirming his criminal record, saying Christian B was convicted of “disobedience” and “theft”.A spokesman for the Faro District of the Portuguese Public Prosecution Service said: “In the last few days, several news articles have been published linking the German national suspected of involvement in Madeleine McCann’s disappearance to other court cases that took place in the Faro district.“In order to clary the matter, the Public Ministry has been examining its records and has so far managed to collect the following information.“The Maddie suspect was convicted of disobedience in one case and of theft in another.“Five requests for international judicial cooperation were also found in which the name of the suspect is mentioned.“One of the requests is related to a case actioned against unknown people and closed in February , and four related to the investigation into Madeleine McCann’s disappearance.”Local media had reported that the -year-old spent two months in Evora Prison, in central Portugal, and nine months in jail in the Algarve for petrol theft in . On  May , the politan Police announced they would be reopening an investigation into Madeleines disappearance. A request for a review of the evidence came from then Home Secretary Theresa May.British polices involvement, known as Operation Grange, is led by the Specialist Crime Command Unit and directed by DCI Mark Cranwell, who has over  years experience in the force.The investigation has cost an estimated £million.In , Madeleine vanished from her bed in the McCanns holiday apartment in Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, Praia da Luz.The ground-floor apartment was in the fth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village. At the time, Christian B, who is now German prosecutors lead suspect in the case, had been living at a run-down shack just miles away.Detectives have also focused on a small farmhouse in the hamlet of Monte Judeu, around four miles from Praia da Luz.This is where the suspect lived in the years before Madeleines disappearance.German prosecutors have said that the investigation in Christian B could be droppedthe public dont come forward with more information. Hans Christian Wolters told the BBC: #We have evidence against the accused which leads us to believe that he really killed Madeleine but this evidence is not strong enough at the moment to take him to court.#The investigator said that while the evidence is #strong enough to say that the girl is dead and strong enough to accuse a specic inidual of murder#, cops need more information from the public. He added: #One has to be honest and remain open to the possibility that our investigation could end without a charge, that it ends like the others have.#We are optimistic it will be dferent for us but for that we need more information.#It comes after Mr Wolters issued a plea for British tourists who lived in Praia da Luz between  and  to come forward.He told Sky News earlier: “We expect that she is dead, but we dont have enough evidence that we can get a warrant for our suspect in Germany for the murder of Madeleine McCann. Dutch police are working with German authorities to determine whether Christian B was behind the disappearance of a seven-year-old in .Police in The Hague said they were going to #exchange information# about the suspect with German cops, after Jaïr Soares vanished from a beach nearly  years ago.Leo Simais, from The Hagues cold case team, told Dutch paper De Telegraaf: #We would be crazywe didnt look closely at this German man.#We have now made contact with the German Criminal Investigation Service and are going to exchange information.#We are now working on a presentation about the disappearance of Jaïr, which we can then take with us#.A German police chief warned his officers to watch Christian B in , after he was released from prison for sexually abusing a child.The leading officer, from Braunschweig, where the suspect lived, reportedly told his officers #not to take eyes off him for a minute#.The now former cop told German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung: #Maybe we had the right feeling back then#.-year-old Christian B is currently serving a  month jail term for drugs trafficking. A BARMAID has recalled the moment Christian B shouted at her the child is dead when colleagues discussed Madeleine McCanns disappearance.The suspect is said to have got #very aggressive, nervous and agitated# as workers at a kiosk he ran in his hometown of Braunschweig brought up the toddler.Barmaid Lenta Johlitz, , told ITV News: #He said very loudly the child is dead! After all these years you wouldnt find such a corpse anyway.#That was the only situation where I look back and ask myself Why did he say that back then She previously revealed how Christian B #lost it# when the missing youngster was mentioned # and said it was a #good thing# she was dead.Lenta said: #He wanted us to stop.

All the other drivers on the motorway could see it too. But the Tesla, bombing along at around mph, with its self-drive autopilot system engaged, did NOT see it.It even went straight past the driver of the overturned truck who was at the side of the road, a good distance from the crash site, frantically warning oncoming motorists to slow down. And then came the impact.Luckily, no one was hurt. But the accident does serve as a useful reminder about technology. It can make le fun and it can make le convenient.

Had he not researched the car at all  I know Tesla says its autonomous system is nine times safer than a human. But a quick Google search would suggest that sometimes, like all technology, it isn’t safe at all.I actually quite like Tesla’s current range of cars. I think they are interesting and fun and I can see why, in lockdown, the Model  was the best-selling car in Britain. But I have a word of warning for anyone tempted to buy one and engage its autopilot: Don’t.Think of it as the tool you get on a Swiss Army kne that can be used for getting stones out of a horse’s hoof. It’s a talking point . . . but you’d never actually use it.IT has been the biggest police manhunt in history. But now, after a multimillion-pound, -year search across  countries, there appears to be a genuine breakthrough in the search for Madeleine McCann.That’s great. But what staggers me is that the new chief suspect Christian B was living just a few miles from the Portuguese resort where she was last seen. His phone puts him in the resort itself on the night of the abduction.He was even interviewed by Plod back in . And it’s not like he was a model citizen. Described as a burglar and a drug dealer, it’s known he was also a paedophile. He’s even doing time in Germany right now for child sex offences. And yet somehow he was never arrested.It makes me wonder.

Boris wants distancing cut to one metre, giving the all-clear for pubs and restaurants to reopen and start rehiring the millions laid off since lockdown.Rishi Sunak is counting on this to trim Treasury job-support measures costing the economy a dizzying £billion.It will kickstart a new-normal summer, with open-air weddings, beer-garden service and marquees to protect punters from the rain.Summer holidays are back on track after being stymied for weeks.Airlines will bypass quarantine with air corridors to approved holiday destinations such as Italy, France, Greece and Turkey.These measures are not risk-free. Scientists point to a possible surge in Covid cases in the North.But equally reputable experts insist there is little chance of a second wave.The risk of the NHS failing to cope has now passed.Meanwhile, lockdown has brought its own death toll. Countless lives have certainly been lost from failure to diagnose and treat cancers and heart diseases.The price in lost schooling and crippled le chances will be paid for decades to come.Lting lockdown is a tough decision for any prime minister.But, as Boris knows better than most, to lead is to choose.

A delaying-the-inevitable tactic which meant, by the time Phil and Dennis’s tickets for the April  game between West Ham and Burnley arrived in mid May, the fixture was as dead as Dennis.A lucky escapeyou ask me.The day of reckoning, when it runs out of episodes, fast approaches, of course. For the duration of the outbreak, though, it’s been a biological miracle.Regulars have packed The Vic, mobbed the Bridge Street market and just stood around gawping and muttering, in their usual community-serving way, when Keegan’s sandwich van was trashed by the local drug dealers.The presence of a global pandemic hasn’t stopped EastEnders lecturing us about other medical issues, obviously.Since the boat party accident, in February, it’s been particularly concerned about Ben Mitchell’s deafness, which cut no ice with me for a couple of good reasons.Firstly, Ben Mitchell is a dreadful, immoral, six-headed little turd who it’s impossible to like, let alone love.Secondly, they’d forgotten he was partially deaf for most of the previous decade.There’s not an international crisis or continuity glitch in the universe that can stand in the way of EastEnders’ moral grandstanding, though, so they decided viewers should “see and hear” last week’s heist episode, with Barry Grant off Brookside, through the eyes and ears of Ben.A particularly gormless enterprise, this one, which went off like Norman Collier and Jimi Hendrix on the same bill at The Half Moon in Putney, and was all feedback and missing words.To ram home the message for the hard of thinking, the action was also accompanied by word cloud subtitles that appeared to have been written by Tarzan.“Keep mind on job.”“Cut power.”“Ben, this mistake.”“Daughter without father.”Compared with other EastEnders episodes, I enjoyed it a lot. I usually do when the show tries something a bit dferent and thought you could actually write the entire history of the show in half a dozen lines of this new Tarzan-speak.“Den hate Angie.” “Peter change head.” “Phil. Him shot.” “You not mother.” “Me am mother.” “Peter change head again.” “Get out pub.” It’d be timely as well. After  years and four months of almost constant shouting and stall-minding, EastEnders goes off air next week.Tantalisingly, The Sun’s very own Andy Halls reported, on Friday, that when it s the show will have dropped its old storylines. A dream scenario which allowed me to fantasise about EastEnders .. A happier, funnier show that’s only on twice a week, where the BBC doesn’t endlessly bask in its own right-on virtue and the majority of characters actually sound like Londoners, instead of stage-schooleditorials.But that’s not going to happen, is it So I’m just going to enjoy the silence. Tarzan like.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in the Midlands shares its name with a meeting between two sporting rivals ”Bill: “Birmingham.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an th century poem, what season of the year did Keats describe as ‘a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Ben Shephard: “The Anglo-Dutch wars were fought primarily between England and which modern-day country ”Amy: “Denmark.”.THE Last Leg, Desiree Burch on the George Floyd fallout: “Follow black artists and thinkers on social media, people who have good resources, information, opinions and insights. Right now I have two shows you could watch — Desiree’s Coming Early and Tar Baby.”Or you could watch Too Hot To Handle, where Netflix films young people having sex while artist thinker Desiree offers her “insights and opinions”.But she’s clearly too modest to mention her role on that one.THIS week’s winner is Tory MP Andrew Bridgen and Harry Enfield’s Tim Nice But Dim.

Seriously, how  It’s a late-night ITV show, with no one to bleep out the swearing, but with BBC levels of over-manning.The star, obviously, was Peter Crouch, who’s actually funnier than  per cent of TV comedians and more likable than all of them, but not yet ready to front his own show. So they added Maya Jama, who looked sensational in her Status Quo Blue For You-era denims, the compulsory Horne Section and Chris Ramsey, who was hiding behind a fence at the start.

Ron Hubbard, so they’ve included a few eccentrics to liven  up the process.On the one hand there’s martial arts enthusiast Robin, who explains: “Our parenting style is influenced by eastern philosophy. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism,” ventriloquism, egotism, Roxette’s fourth album Tourism.On the other there’s gender fluid feminist nut Joana, who is attempting to bring up five-year-old son Willow as “a free spirit”, by banning the word “boy”, refusing to buy him “militaristic toys” and plastering her house in idiotic Socialist Worker propaganda.Hopefully, little Willow will be a stalwart of his local golf club and TA unit  in about  years’ time.But that’s no real saving grace for the show, nor a reason to watch any part of Britain’s Best Parent, apart from the final vote where, every week, the studio audience has to choose between those “free spirits” who let the kids rule the roost and those couples, like David and Nicky, who run their house more like an SAS boot camp.And every week, I’m happy to report, they vote for the boot camp.All hope for Britain may not be lost.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The sanctions are thought to be having a devastating impact on North Koreas economy and population. Despite the decision only officially coming into force today, a spokesperson for the South Korean ministry of defence said routine daily calls made through the liaison office yesterday went unanswered. Daniel Wertz, Programme Manager at the National Committee on North Korea, tweeted that severing communications was a well-worn play for the North, but a dangerous one amid the coronavirus crisis. The spat comes after Kim Jong-un disappeared from view for almost three weeks in April, prompting speculation about his health as well as reports of his death. He reemerged at the beginning of May, and this week was seen smiling at a meeting of senior officials from the ruling Workers Party.The KNCA report stated that Kim and other senior figures in Pyongyang had decided that “the work towards the South should thoroughly turn into one against an enemy”.“[The North Korean people have] been angered by the treacherous and cunning behaviour of the South Korean authorities, with whom we will have lots of accounts to settle, it said. “We have reached a conclusion that there is no need to sit face to face with the South Korean authorities and there is no issue to discuss with them, as they have only aroused our dismay.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Berman however issued a statement which accused the Prince of ly portraying himself to the public as eager and willing to co-operate. The US Department of Justice has filed a mutual legal assistance request to the Home Office - which formally asks for help to question the Royal.Andrew is facing ongoing scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Epstein, who was at the centre of a web of sex trafficking and abuse before killing himself in jail last August.The Duke has always denied any improper behaviour over his relationship with Epstein, and strongly denies allegations he slept with sex slave Virginia Roberts when she was .Sources have claimed Andrew may never cooperate with the probe while Mr Berman is in charge, reports the \" href\"https:www.telegraph news    epstein-prosecutor-has-made-impossible-prince-andrew-co-operate \" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\". Insiders insist that Andrew should remain a witness rather than a target in the federal investigation into Epstein.The source said: The Duke would have cooperated fully with Berman had he not chosen to make an example of him.What we saw yesterday was a trebling down by Berman on this consistent modus operandi of throwing away the rule book and commenting on what are supposed to be completely confidential discussions surrounding the co-operation of a witness.The source added: Why does he get to tear the rule book up  Who does he think he is  There is no way that statement was designed to encourage the Duke to co-operate. It was a sarcastic, knee-jerk response to a very reasonable and factually accurate statement about the assistance the Duke has offered so far. In fact, all it does is confirm what we have been dealing with here all along.Royal insiders accused Mr Berman of seeking publicity and attempting to use Andrew as a scapegoat for the failures of the case.Andrew is claimed to have been first contacted by authorities in January, despite Epstein being investigated for  years. Mr Berman previously claimed the Duke has offered zero cooperation back in January, and then said the Royal had completely shut the door on the probe in March.The source said: Every time Berman has opened his mouth, he has undermined his own case.Lawyers for the Duke of York, , have insisted he has offered to give a witness statement to investigators probing Epstein.Mr Berman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, has accused Andrew of repeatedly refusing to cooperate - and alleges the Dukes team unequivocally told his office in March he would not be quizzed.Lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents some of Epsteins victims, told BBCs Newsnight: Justice delayed is justice denied and he needs to stop playing a cat and mouse game with the United States Department of Justice.He needs to stop delaying and trying to evade answering questions and he should not be setting any conditions,in fact thats what hes doing.It comes as William Barr, the US Attorney General, said the Duke of York will not be extradited to the US for questioning over his links into Epstein.Andrews legal firm also hit out at earlier claims from Mr Berman that there has been a wall of silence from the Duke.Blackfords LLP acting for the royal said: The Duke of York has on at least three occasions this year offered his assistance as a witness to the DOJ. Unfortunately, the DOJ has reacted to the first two offers by breaching their own confidentiality rules and claiming that the Duke has offered zero cooperation.In doing so, they are perhaps seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered.The Sun Online has contacted Andrews lawyers for comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Give us those.“They are stood there empty, doing nothing. We can use those spaces to teach kids.”He said it was predictable the “wheels would come off” the government’s policy because it has not been thought through.He said: “The government said schools need to be socially distanced and then said the whole school has got to come back.“You don’t have to be Einstein to work out that is impossible.

The then -year-old drter told her: “I have a job to do in Praia da Luz tomorrow. It’s a horrible job but it’s something I have to do and it will change my le. You won’t be seeing me for a while.”Christian disappeared at the same time as Madeleine — resurfacing three years later working in a bar in Lagos, around six miles from Praia da Luz.It was in the bar in  that his other British girlfriend suggested \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he was a dead ringer for some of the photofits of the Madeleine suspects — and jokingly asked: “You did it Christian, didn’t you ”A friend of the girls said today: “He blanked the question and shrugged — then added, ‘Just don’t go there’.”The pal added: “It was said at a time when everyone had a theory about the Madeleine mystery and everyone had a story.So everyone who knew him around that time kind of dismissed it.”Christians cryptic comments the night before Madeleine vanished were similarly not taken seriously at the time.The friend added: “The ex-girlfriend with him at dinner didn’t compute what he’d said because she didn’t believe him capable of doing something like that — \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"even though he had been violent before.“Then Christian went off the radar the day after the abduction. Both his exes became more suspicious when he didn’tto the area for around three years.“They read about the witness accounts and realised some of the photofits and artist’s impressions struck a chord.”But the penny finally dropped last week when police in Germany announced they believed a criminal they identied only as Christian B had links to Madeleine’s abduction.The friend said: “We knew exactly who ‘Christian B’ was, even when the first pictures of him appeared online with a black bar across his face.“And now we all fear we know exactly what he’s done. All the ­pieces of the jigsaw have fallen into place. We’re horried and traumatised. It just doesn’t bear thinking about.“What he said at that dinner suggests he planned the whole thing very carefully and that he might even have stolen Madeleine to order.“But we also can’t help feeling guilty thinking we should have pulled together all the clues years ago and gone to the police.”The friend, a man in his s from North Yorkshire who has lived in Lagos for more than ten years, met Christian when he worked at the expat bar, called The Tavern.He said: “\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Christian had a camper van but wasn’t a hippy as has been said.“He wasn’t a bad-looking bloke and was always well groomed.“He was quite brash and loud and was also a bit of a charmer and I could see why women might be attracted to him.“But I never liked him because I’m a close friend of both of the British girls he dated and they both told me he beat them up.“They’ve both been beside themselves for days since the police appeals and don’t know what to do.“Their first priority is to help police because they know a lot of things that probably join up a lot of the dots in the investigation.”The friend said the women are desperate to ensure Christian, currently in jail after the rape of a -year-old woman in Praia da Luz in , remains locked up.He added: “Their main concern is making sure he’s convicted and stays in prison because they know what kind of person he is.“They’re terried he might get out one day and come for them.”One of the women is a mum of two from Berkshire. She lived in Praia da Luz when she dated convicted paedophile Christian in the early s.She is understood to have been questioned previously by detectives at her current home in Lagos but the nature of her evidence has not come to light until now.She has now spoken again to police re-focusing inquiries on -year-old Christian, who is serving his prison sentence in Germany. The ex-girlfriend is not a suspect but agreed to co-operate by giving a statement.She is a friend of the other British woman, also in a relationship with Christian in the noughties.There is no suggestion either of the women had any clue about any involvement he might have had in the abduction of the British toddler.The ex-husband of one of the women, a businessman who still lives in Lagos, was also spoken to by Interpol last year as police pieced together Christians history.He has refused to say what police asked or how he knew Christian.The husband said: “We’ve decided not to talk. The police have been in touch and we’ve spoken to them. I spoke to Interpol last year.“I’m speaking on behalf of my ex too.

From last Monday schools, have been encouraged to reopen for pupils in nursery, reception, primary one and primary six. But teachers unions, head teachers, and parents warned that the move was happening too quickly and schools were not ready to take pupils back. Government stats published today have revealed that around half of primary schools in England reopened to more children last week. The pupil attendance rate in nursery and primary schools was % on Thursday last week. While that figure takes into account the years that are not yet allowed back to school, it also suggests that take up among parents allowed totheir children to school is relatively low. The Department for Educationfigures show that % of education settings that normally accept at least one of these year groups were open to additional children on June . More vulnerable pupils attended school in the last week. While many have been eligible to attend school throughout the crisis alongside the children of key workers, take up of places had been low. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “It is encouraging to see the majority of primary schools open their doors to more pupils, and almost double the number of children now attending early years settings. “This is still a dficult time for families and many feel anxious about their children going back – but I can reassure families, and those working in education settings, that the welfare of children and staff will continue to be at the heart of all our decisions. “Families should also be reassured by the incredible work teachers and support staff are doing to adapt their settings and routines, while making sure schools and nurseries remain as welcoming as they have always been.” It came as Ministers were set to ditch plans for other years toto school before September.

Last weekend Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said of the Black Lives Matter protests: “Thankfully, this is all based in response to events in America rather than here.” This betrayed an attitude of arrogance, complacency and ignorance. Of course, the brutal murder of George Floyd triggered this moment of mass protest: first in the US and then across the world. But it has only gathered the momentum in this country, because prejudice, bias and, yes, racism, exists on this side of the Atlantic, too. Labour does not support how the protesters pulled down the statue of Edward Colston, but it should have been removed democratically a long time ago. Colston, who smuggled more than , men, women and children out of Africa to be sold as slaves, does not deserve to be memorialised in Bristol.

Documents show SAGE, the government’s scientic advisory group, suggested an “offer of financial support” to hard-up peoplethe NHS tells them to stay at home for  days. In a meeting on May , SAGE said the scheme needs a “high level of adherence” - and people might not comply “ they are impacted financially”. But no new pot of cash for self-isolating people, beyond what already exists, has been announced since that meeting. Statutory Sick Pay was extended near the start of the outbreak to those self-isolating due to Covid- - and is now paid from day one. But campaigners say the £.-a-week rate is not enough, and workers must earn at least £ a week to qualy. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran called for workers to get % of their usual salary up to £, a monththey self-isolate - as in the furlough scheme. The leadership hopeful said: “The Government must stop ignoring the science and ensure those required to self-isolate receive adequate financial support. “As SAGE has concluded, the test and trace system relies on high levels of compliance to succeed. “Yet ministers appear to have ignored this advice, forcing people into an impossible choice between financial hardship or breaking the rules by ing to work. “People must not be pushed into poverty for doing the right thing.”  Launched this month, the test and trace system tells anyone who’s had contact with a Covid- sufferer to isolate for two weeks. The SAGE comments came during a newly-published meeting to discuss the test and trace scheme. The scientists agreed: “A high level of adherence to requests to isolate is required for the system to be effective. “Risks include iniduals becoming less willing to comply…they are impacted financially from being asked to isolate. “An accessible offer of financial support to those in need could reduce the risk of non-adherence.”  But a DWP spokesman hit back: “Statutory Sick Pay was extended to employees who are required to self-isolate for this exact reason. “We’ve also made this more generous by making it payable from day one, as well as refunding employers with fewer than  employees the cost of up to two weeks’ sick pay. Employers can, and many do pay more than the statutory rate – something we encourage. “This government has provided an unprecedented package of support to help people through this pandemic including injecting £.bn into the welfare system, rolling out income protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional support for renters.”The DWP said some of those ineligible for sick pay may be able to claim Universal Credit. In the same meeting, SAGE said the system should ask people to isolate even after contact with an unconfirmed case. Yet the government did not take up this advice. Instead, it is only asking people to isolatetheir contact had a positive Covid- test result. Some , contact tracers are already tracking down the movements of any new cases.

The Silver Voices group plans a “gum up the works” drive to hamper curbs which would see millions of over-s lose the leline. Director Dennis Reed wrote to the BBC outlining plans for the groupaposs members “to withdraw from direct debit arrangements with TV Licensing and to noty you that, in future, all payments and correspondence about the fee will be conducted by cheque and post”. Mr Reed told the Mirror last month the drive was aimed at making the cost of administering and enforcing the licence fee “much more expensive than keeping the free licence for a relatively small group”. In a reply to Mr Reed, seen by this paper, the BBCaposs controller for policy Paul Oldfield said: “Under the current schemes the vast majority of people pay for their licence by direct debit or other payment options that suit them so that they can pay in instalments for example.  “TVLoffers payment by cheque but has to collect the full licence cost without instalment options. “Under TVL’s current systems, we are trying to encourage customers not to post us information during this time.” Some . million OAPs are due to lose free licences, worth £. a year, from August .Curbs on entitlement were due to come into force on June  but were delayed by two months because of the coronavirus pandemic.The Mirror is campaigning to permanently save the benefit, with more than , readers backing the fight by completing coupons in the paper. The TV licensing system is run and enforced by outsourcing firm Capita. Silver Voices is urging its members to withdraw from direct debits and standing orders, only communicate with TV Licensing through post rather than email, pay by cheque or cash and use “creative but legal ways to complicate and delay payment” such as paying “slightly too much so that a credit note has to be organised”. Mr Reed dubbed it a “classic consumer-based campaign using reliance on labour-saving systems to force change”.  He told the Mirror: “The BBC is obviously very worried about the potential impact of our campaign and the Government should be too. “Our legal direct action against one of their favourite private contractors – Capita – who run TV Licensing should persuade the Government to work with the BBC to ensure that this essential benefit is retained.” The Conservatives pledged at the  election to protect over-sapos free licences for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run until .

Christine Emelone said the comment left her feeling embarrassed and completely alone, and says itaposs proof that racism is still evident in Britain. The student journalist, who worked part time at the major food chain, said that black women should be able to be in control over their hair, their wants and their lives and should not feel pressure to become something that theyaposre not. Writing for student news site The Tab, Christine said the incident took place last month. She added that she took some time off from work in the immediate aftermath but has since ed. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here Christine said: As I entered the staff room of where I work, my manager approached me abruptly before giving me a long, disdained look. He said that I could not work today because was my hairstyle was aposunprofessionalapos and aposunfit for workapos. He asked me to leave. I didnapost get paid that day. I desperately needed the money for an urgent personal issue, but I didnapost think he would understand. Colleagues came up to me asking what had happened, why I looked so glum, but I simply couldnapost find the words to say. The fact that they were working shts and I wasnapost because of my tight, kinky black coils baffled me, and the last thing I wanted was to be laughed at after I had been embarrassed by my boss. This happened at a major fast food chain - last month. Prior to this incident, I had a vivid understanding of hair discrimination, but had never actually experienced it for myself. I had never actually been in the shoes of someone who had been judged purely because of the style of their hair and its appearance. I felt completely alone. I didnapost know who to talk to. Even though it didnapost sound asit was a big deal, it was a serious issue that affected me and deeply hurt my feelings. I wondered whether it was normal, or something that usually happened that people just didnapost talk about and ignored. However, I stand confident to say that my natural, afro hair is part of who I am, and I am in no way ashamed of it. She added: Black people across the UK have been barred from jobs, schools and public events because they choose to style their hair in locks, Afros and twists. I think itaposs completely absurd and really doesnapost make sense. Why canapost people be accepted for who they are  Many black people face mounting pressure to wear their hair in a way that conforms to more European standards of beauty and spend huge amounts to chemically straighten and maintain their hair. To me, this is an important problem that needs to be addressed. Black women should not feel like they need to change their hair to conform to anything! Itaposs who they are and should not feel pressure to become something that theyaposre not. Even though more people have embraced natural hair in recent years, the stories of hair discrimination remain prevalent, echoing through the African American community and where. Christine didnapost change her hair but didto work, adding that her manager didnapost mention it when they saw her next. She added: In the UK, workplace discrimination, on the basis or race, religion or gender, is illegal in the UK.

Up to  people attended the anti-racism protest at the Clock Tower in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, which was met by opposition from a group of largely white men. Footage shows how counter-demonstrators hurled insults at the group, including one unidentied person who was clearly heard saying go back to Africa. Another highly-agitated man is also seen telling the group to shut your f****** mouths during the disruption, prompting a police officer to step in. In another clip, the group chant at the Black Lives Matter demonstrators to get their **** out for the lads, while one protester claimed to see Nazi salutes. Reports say that the counter-protest was there to aposdefendapos Hoddesdonaposs WWII monument after a Winston Churchill statue was vandalised in central London on Sunday. Hertfordshire Police said it is now taking action following the incident but did not sayany arrests have been made. Social media users have expressed their anger over the scenes and say that officers at the scene should have intervened to stop the harassment. Demi-Leigh Sheahan attended the protest and shared videos of the chants online. She told HertsLive : Personally, what I find so disgusting and frightening about these videos is, firstly, that ending racism has somehow become a controversial topic. People from Hoddesdon and surrounding areas have gone out of their way during a global pandemic to oppose the BLM protesters and with such vile and derogatory language.  Regardless whether you support the riots or not, I would find it hard to believe that you would be comfortable with a fully grown adult man shouting aposget your t**s outapos at your daughter, mother, sister, friend or even just anyone you know. Another protester said she felt that something wasnapost right as soon as she arrived on the high street and claimed to have witnesses Nazi salutes. They were saying, aposgo back to your own countryapos, aposgo back to your rockapos,aposyou’re not welcome hereapos,aposeducate yourselfapos she explained.  It comes after a statue of th century slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down and thrown into Bristol Harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest on Sunday. Today, demonstrators will protest in front of the statue of Cecil Rhodes in Oxford on Tuesday as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. It comes amid a wider decolonise movement sweeping universities across the world in recent years. Following protests across the UK on the weekend, the Prime Minister - who had previously condemned the thuggery by a minority that marred some demonstrations - acknowledged many of the activistsapos concerns were founded on a cold reality. He said leaders simply canapost ignore concerns that black, Asian and minority ethnic groups face discrimination in education, employment and in law. But the PM said those who harmed police or property would face the full force of the law.  Tottenham Hotspur football club released a statement on Twitter after the video emerged, saying: These are no fans of ours.

Last week saw the reopening of car showrooms and outdoor markets, while non-essential shops are about to open their doors following a three-month enforced closure. A OnePoll Consumer Confidence Survey found  per cent of UK adults expect to spend the same or more on household purchases than they did last year - with nine per cent prepared to dig deeper. This is likely to be music to the ears of the embattled High Street, with respondents expressing their intention to purchase goods such as carpets, furniture, and electrical products for their home. The nationally representative survey, of , adults, found that despite going through a bleak three months, two-thirds are confident enough that their le will eventually go back to how it was before. However, while seven per cent of UK adults are expecting an above inflation pay rise, a quarter fear they will suffer a fall in annual income, while  per cent think they will have to look for a new job. A consequence of this is a transformation in the way savvy-spending Brits buy their food. Cost-cutting is key for many, with  per cent planning on using the same supermarket but being more bargain conscious, while a fth will be opting for cheaper stores to do their food shop. Fewer than halfof those questioned by OnePoll said they would go back to how they shopped beforehand.  But  per cent are going to use supermarket delivery services more - which could be a welcome shot in the arm for Britainaposs van manufacturing sector, particularly among firms which produce zero emission vehicles. The property industry can also expect a boost, with  per cent of respondents saying they will relocate or move to a new house. This figure is highest among - years olds This is tempered by a fear that house prices will fall. Twice as manyBrits expect to see a drop in prices than those who think property in their area will increase in value . However, this could be a positive development for first-time buyers and those looking to climb the property ladder.

Student nurse Louise Kerton, from Broadstairs, Kent, was last seen in Germany in July , where she was supposed to be catching a train from the city of Aachen, near the border with Holland and Belgium, before taking a ferry to Dover. Her father Phil Kerton has never given up hope of finding out what happened to his daughter, who was then , and he is following the fresh developments in the McCann investigation closely. Mr Kerton, , said of the latest news: It just confirms that the family have been right to keep persisting, there was something to find out there.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email. Certainly the German police seemed confident they are onto something there. It gives one some sort of hope that the truth is out there to be found. Mr Kerton, of New Ash Green, Kent, added: I have sort of given up getting too excited I am afraid. We have just got to keep calm but keep the pressure on.  In a separate interview, Mr Kerton told the Sun: Christian seems to have gone after all ages, despite preferring the very young. I would urge police to make sure his whereabouts and his activities at the time of Louise’s disappearance are properly investigated.” He added: I have read that the German police are taking an interest in finding out where Christian B was in relation to unsolved cases, so I hope Louise’s gets drawn in.” He said his daughter had been really careful about travelling around and that it seemed very unlikely that she would have come to harm on a train somewhere.  Louise was a school friend of air hostess Lucie Blackman, who was found murdered in Japan in February . There is no direct evidence of anyone having seen Miss Kerton in Aachen or on the train she was due to take, nor at her intended destination of Ostend. Mr Kerton says he would love Kent Police to be involved in the latest investigationit might help shine a light on his daughteraposs case, but said he is not going to push German authorities while they are looking into what happened to Madeleine. He added: I am letting the authorises get on with investigating the Madeleine link, I do not want to distract them . Mr Kerton says he just wants them to ask about what happened to his daughter when Brueckner is questioned. Prosecutors are examining any links between the suspect and the disappearances of several children across Europe. Investigators believe there are victims of related sex crimes who have not come forward.  Police were already taking another look at the disappearances of Inga Gehricke, five, in Germany in May  and Rene Hasee, six, in Portugalaposs Algarve in June  to find outBrueckner was responsible. It emerged on Tuesday that police were also probing whether the suspect was responsible for snatching and killing nine-year-old girl Peggy Knobloch almost two decades ago. She was previously dubbed the German Maddie by British tabloids and her death has been called Germanyaposs most mysterious criminal case. The youngster vanished on her way home from school in May  and her remains werenapost discovered until July , when mushroom pickers found human bones in a forest nine miles from Peggyaposs home in Lichtenberg, Baia."},{"url":null,"title":"dad transforms scrubland garden love","story":"NewsDad transforms scrubland garden into Love Island villa replica with fire pitDad-of-two Derry Green decided to use his time in lockdown to give his garden a makeover - and as the weeks stuck inside grew, so did the size of his projectShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video dad-turns-garden-love-island-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news dad-transforms-scrubland-garden-love-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The -year-old said he decided to tackle the garden to make use of his time stuck at home, but weeks quickly turned into months as he continued to add to the project. He initially took inspiration from the Mallorca based villa seen on the UK version of Love Island after wanting to incorporate its outdoor fairy lights. Roping in his children Sophia, eight, and Noah, five, to help, the makeover slowly expanded and Derry says heaposs now inundated with requests from friends and family to visit the garden on sunny days. He said: It wasnapost supposed to be as big as this, it just ended up that way because Iaposve had time on my hands as the weeks turn into months. It all started around this fire pit in the middle which we already had and it just expanded from there. It wasnapost my original idea to turn it into the Love Island villa but I did steal the idea for the lights from the show because my missus watches it and Iaposve seen them on the television and I thought they looked really nice. Now everyone tells me it looks just like the Love Island villa. Thereaposs people that I havenapost spoken to for  years from school but have been messaging me about it.  I never expected it to blow up like this, itaposs been crazy. Handyman Derry did all the manual labour himself, ordering the equipment online and using sites like Pinterest for inspiration.With foreign holidays unlikely this year, Derry also wanted to create a holiday space at home for his two children to enjoy in the warmer weather."},{"url":null,"title":"how much parents spending babys","story":"NewsHow much parents are spending on babys first birthday party - and its not cheapA poll found mums and dads are spending the most money on personalised cakes for the first birthday party, along with a new outfit for the baby and balloon archesShareCommentsByRichard Jenkins:,  JUN NewsParents spend a whopping £ on their childs first birthday\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

This is more than any other milestone birthday party during childhood despite it being a birthday most boys and girls wonapost even remember. In comparison, the average sweet sixteen costs £, while th birthday parties see parents spend £ and £ on th parties. The poll, of , parents of children aged -, commissioned by social money app Pingit, found personalised cakes are the most expensive items parents buy for a first birthday party, along with a new outfit for the baby and balloon arches. Party props, such as a fake snow machine or glitter blaster, a childrenaposs entertainer and personalised party favours also see the budget blown. However, as lockdown and social distancing measures have caused havoc to party plans, one in five parents would cancel a childaposs birthday celebration completely rather than go ahead with a scaled back version. Just under a thirdwould reschedule so the party could happen at a later date - while  per cent would attempt a aposvirtualapos bash. Pingitaposs jar , which allows users to save in up to five aposjarsapos at a time, helps parents easily manage their money and budget for several occasions at the same time - helping them to avoid blowing the birthday budgets. Pingit director Clare Francis said: We have seen a noticeable trend in Pingit customers naming savings aposjarsapos after birthday parties.  And it is clear the UK is spending big when it comes to celebrating their childrenaposs big day. Being a mum myself, I understand how much you can end up splashing out before you know it. The study also found parents spend an average of three months budgeting and saving in order to pull off the perfect first birthday party for their baby. But many are split on what they would do as a result of the lockdown.  While a third would keep a tight grip on their budget amid financial insecurity at the moment,  per cent admit they would splash more cash than they planned to make sure their child has an extra special birthday at home. It also emerged parents feel under pressure to put on the perfect party from celebrity culture , other parents on social mediaand family members . Before the lockdown restrictions put a stop to their extravagant plans, twenty per cent even tried to copy bashes hosted by social media influencers and celebrities. Ten per cent admitted to throwing lavish affairs to outdo other parents while a further  per cent only put on a big party to show off to other family members.  But four in  of those polled, via OnePoll, admitted they spend more time stressing about the party than celebrating. More than a third, however, believe it to be worth the hassle to pull off a party better than another parent in their playgroup. To help relieve the party planning stress - virtual or otherwise - Pingit has partnered with pop star and mother of two, Jamelia, to help parents plan a memorable and stress-free birthday party. Jamelia said: We have all been there, t-minus two weeks to b-day and the party entertainment serves you with an unexpected and early invoice.

Janet Kearns then cleaned the blade, put it back into the kne block and walked away, leaving her victim bleeding to death outside his flat. A key artery in his right arm had been cut through but his le was saved thanks to the actions of paramedics and doctors. A court heard Kearns, who had two children from a previous relationship and worked as a cleaner, terrorised her partner for almost two years. He had previously threatened to call police, but she had told him: Youaposll be dead before they get here. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here When he finally dumped the -year-old, she went to his third-floor flat in Wythenshawe, Manchester, in May last year and flew into a rage because he hadnapost called to wish her a happy birthday. She stabbed him during a furious bust-up and then left him for dead. Today Kearns, of Minehead Avenue in Withington, was jailed after she admitted GBH with intent. Manchester Crown Court heard, Kearnsapos behaviour aposbecame increasingly erraticapos over the course of the next year when she aposbecame aggressive on occasions over apparently trivial mattersapos.  She would complain he didnapost pay her enough attention and sometimes aposthreatened violence against himapos.Her partner aposbecame unhappy with the relationship but decided to persevere with it, in the hope that it would improveapos, Brian Berlyne, prosecuting told the court. But by April  the relationship deteriorated further and he began to discuss ending it.The pair argued over the phone on Friday May , , and he told Kearns it would be the last weekend of their relationship. The next day he sent her a text wishing her a happy birthday - she was  - and she thanked him in another text about three hours later. CCTV seized by the police showed Kearns used her key to enter his flat at Edwards Court at .pm when she aggressively asked him why he had not called her. The pair aposgrappled with each otherapos and she tried to poke the flat key into his eye and face, Mr Berlyne said. Kearns followed him out to the landing as he began to call police but went back inside to fetch a serrated six-inch kne from his kitchen. Armed with the kne, she caught up with her victim at the lobby door.With the phone in his left hand, he tried to keep Kearns away with his right hand but moments later felt what was the blade being drawn across the inside of his right arm. He looked down and saw that he was bleeding profusely.The defendant was holding a kne, which he recognised as the smallest of a set of six from a kne block in his kitchen.This kne had a blade about  inches long with a serrated edge, said the prosecutor. The victim told the  operator to call an ambulance and he watched as his ex ed to his flat where she cleaned the weapon and placed it back in the kne block, according to the prosecution.He could feel the blood continuing to pump out of his arm and realised that his artery had been severed. He began to feel faint, so that he was unable to stand, said Mr Berlyne. As he weakened due to the loss of blood, at .pm the defendant ed through the same lobby door. He noticed that she looked at him in a way he interpreted as looking as though she wanted him to die.Despite the fact that by now she must have seen that there was a large pool of blood on the floor and he was no longer able to stand, she offered him no help, made no attempt to summon help, and left the building immediately. He collapsed and police arrived at .pm followed later by paramedics. The victim, by now sweating profusely and very pale, was taken to hospital where medics realised he had become seriously ill through blood loss. He had suffered a deep wound cm up to his elbow, with damage to muscles, an artery and severed nerve. Mr Berlyne said the victim was aposunlikely ever to regain completely normal sensation andof his handapos. When Kearns was arrested she claimed to have grabbed the kne aposto feel more secure in case he attackedapos, alleging she had stabbed him accidentally and had aposintended just to scare himapos. Later she admitted she had seen him bleeding on the floor when she left and that she had apospanickedapos.She said she loved him but she admitted she had lost control and she was sorry. In a victim impact statement read out to the court, her former partner said: That day is a day I can never forget. If it wasnapost for the quick response of the police officers and the paramedics, I would not be here today, as with the medical staff at the hospital. I cannot thank them enough, he said. Of Kearnsapos actions he said: How could she be so cruel after what she did  He said medics told him he could lose his hand but doctors saved it. I have no doubt how lucky I am to be alive, said the man.

He got involved with the wrong crowd. to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email. The media couldnapost name Power in  because at the time he was only  and subject to reporting restrictions. He was back in court yesterday for dangerous driving on a scrambler bike - described by a prosecutor as one of the worst examples heaposd ever seen. Because he has now turned , the yobaposs identity and the litany of crimes he has already committed can be revealed. Power, of Wilburn Street, Walton, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court via video link from HMP Altcourse, where he is being held on remand. Police caught him riding a stolen KTM motorbike on streets including Elderdale Road in Anfield, at around pm, on May  this year. He admitted dangerous driving, driving without insurance and driving without a licence before city magistrates on May . Power was accused of being part of a gang who robbed the £, bike from a man at his home in Rockfield Road, Anfield on January . However, Iain Criddle, prosecuting, explained this charge was discontinued, because the complainant was unwilling to cooperate. Judge Gary Woodhall said: The defendant is named by the complainant as being one of the group who attacked him, is he not  Mr Criddle said the man said the proceedings were affecting his health and he didnapost wish to attend court. He said the case was carefully considered by a senior Crown Prosecution Service lawyer, who decided not to proceed. Judge Woodhall said it was a very serious allegation involving group violence, and confirmed Power was riding the same bike. He said: Heaposs riding the bike stolen in a robbery, in which the complainant has named him as the offender taking it, and thataposs not been pursued  Judge Woodhall asked why the man had not been summoned to appear, but Mr Criddle said he indicated he still wouldnapost attend. He said: The principal consideration was the indication that heaposs given, that the thought of attending at court and having the case hanging over him was having a very negative impact on his health and well being, and he just wanted the hearing stopped. Judge Woodhall said it was the prosecutionaposs decision and he had no power to force the CPS to review it. However, he said the CPS had a public interest duty to ensure where necessary reluctant witnesses do cooperate. Michael OaposBrien, defending, accepted Poweraposs criminal record did not paint a happy picture. He said: Your honour I simply state that heaposs just turned  years of age and for no other reason the court may be assisted by a pre-sentence report, but his record may indicate that may not be helpful here - I ask simply because of his age. I observe heaposs pleaded guilty at the very first opportunity - those are probably the only two features of mitigation open to this defendant.  Mr Criddle said police had not yet provided CCTV footage, but a description of Poweraposs riding was absolutely appalling. He said: Itaposs one of the worst pieces of riding of a motorcycle Iaposve come across in my career. Mr Criddle said the Crown was awaiting the results of a drug test, to see whether Power had cannabis in his system. He said: The officers were satisfied he did smell of cannabis and he appeared to be under the influence of some sort of substance because of his demeanour. Judge Woodhall adjourned sentencing until June  to obtain the CCTV and for the report to be made. He told Power: Understand this, Iaposm not directing the preparation of a pre-sentence report to consider direct alternatives to custody. Iaposm directing that report because of your age, so the court has the fullest information possible about you. Given your previous convictions, the breaches of previous court orders and given the nature of the driving that appears to be described in the papers placed before me today, you should be expecting on the next occasion a custodial sentence - the court will be determining on the next occasion how long that should be. Power has already served  days in custody for failing to attend three Probation Service appointments last June. That was after he was released from a young offenders institution having served half of a sentence for burglary, possessing a lock kne and possessing cannabis. Power was involved in two chases with police in , the first involving a stolen Audi A taken in a £, raid at We Buy Any Caraposs depot in Vauxhall.

Usually, the site is used as a park and ride facility, with the car parks always crammed with vehicles, but not now. As I pulled in, all I could see were people wearing hi-vis jackets or in white protective suits, and dozens of traffic cones scattered across the place. I followed the directions accordingly, and stopped as two men approached my car and asked: Are you here for the test  to which I nervously laughed and replied: yes. One man then instructed me to follow the cones around to the other side of the car park, where I would be told what to do next.  I followed it round, baffled about how quiet the site was - there was one other car in sight taking part in the testing and that was it. I approached the next stage and was greeted by another two people in hi-vis jackets, both wearing face masks. One was stood on the side, and another stood right in front of the car, and began to give instructions via laminate sheets. I was told to keep all windows closed at all times, asI was entering a safari park. The man on the side then tapped the window and asked me to show him my QR I had received as part of my appointment confirmation.  I showed it to him, through the window, of course, along with some ID which I needed to take along. Once the code was scanned and ID checked, I was then told to drive up the slope to the next checkpoint. I proceeded, slowly, the speed limit was mph. It felt like I was on some sort of roller coaster as I drove up the slope, not knowing what would be waiting for me on the other side. And then, it sunk in how big an operation this was. There were several portable buildings all lined up and plenty of gazebos setup, ready for people to be tested. I was met by a woman in a white hazard suit and a face mask, who also had some written instructions for me. I had to show my QR code once more, before being askedI wanted to carry out the test myself or for someone to do it for me. The thought of someone shoving a cotton swab down my throat was not pleasant, but I felt it would be better than me attempting it, so I opted for the trained people to do it for me. I told them, even more nervous than ever, that I would allow them to test me. The woman then went into a cabin, and ed shortly after with a clear plastic bag with swabs and tubes inside.  I quickly worked out this is what would be used to perform the test. She placed it under my windscreen wipers, and I was then told to drive to bay five. So I proceeded onwards, past several of the empty portably buildings, before my destination arrived. I pulled in very slowly, with a cabin to my left, but no sign of anyone. By now, my heart was racing and the nerves really set in. I calmly switched my car engine off and waited like I had entered a car wash. A few moments later, a man dressed in military unorm emerged from the cabin, wearing a white face mask and plastic gloves. He approached my window, which I very slowly opened. Hi there he said, before going through what would happen next. I was askedI had any bleeding from the nose or mouth or any mouth ulcers. I shook my head, before he removed the long swab from the bag and told me he would use both sides of the swab - one for the throat and one for a nostril. My immediate thoughts were how I had seen some diagrams online of how far back the swab goes down the throat, before the man said I may gag. So, I opened my mouth as wide as I could, like I was at the dentist, and was asked to say aposaaaaaahhhhapos before the swab entered my mouth and touched my tonsils.  It went on for a few seconds, as I hoped I would not gag. Thankfully I didnapost and it wasnapost as bad as those grim graphics make out. Next the swab was to be inserted up my nose. It may make you cry a little, the man said as I again chuckled nervously. It didnapost go too far up my left nostril, but boy, did it tickle, and sure enough, a tear ran down my eye. Thataposs great the man said as he placed the swab into the plastic bag and headed back inside the cabin.  He ed shortly after with a small card, which was my aposreceiptapos. Thank you for attending today and completing the test for Covid-, a message on the card read. And that was it. I rolled my window up and proceeded to follow the exit signs. I breathed a huge sigh of relief. It was done. It was such a simple process that was well managed by all involved at the test centre, but I could not help but contemplate how empty the place was. All I wanted to do now was go home, where the painful wait for the test results to come through would begin.  I was told that most people would receive their results within  hours but it could take up to five days. In fact, it was six days. Six long days, which, to be honest, I had almost forgotten that I still hadnapost received my results. But, on Saturday night, my phone buzzed as I had received a text and an email. I opened the email first, which said in capital letters: NHS COVID- NOTIFICATION. I scrolled down. Your Covid- test has come back NEGATIVE. You donapost have the virus at this time.

Dad-of-three Margaritis Xhindi, , was trapped inside a lock-up when a blaze broke out on the Premier Trading Estate, in Leys Road, Brierley Hill, West Midlands. Emergency services rushed to the scene at at .pm last Thursday and pulled the Albanian national from the building along with a second man. Both were rushed to hospital in a serious condition but Mr Xhindi died as a result of his injuries on Friday afternoon.

Detectives believe both vulnerable men had been trafficked into the UK from abroad and were being criminally exploited by a drugs gang. West Midlands Police said the unit, which was being used to grow cannabis on an industrial scale, was locked meaning neither men had a way to escape the blaze. The family of Mr Xhindi have paid tribute to a loving and wonderful man. They said: Margaritis was a loving son, brother and wonderful father of three children. He had worked very hard most of his le to provide for his family. Margaritis has touched the hearts of everybody who knew him and we are devastated with the sad news.Police say a full forensic examination of the scene is taking place while they work alongside the fire service to establish the cause of the fire.

Weaposre also in the process of carrying out a detailed forensic examination of the scene to try and identy who was involved in the cannabis grow and as part of this, weaposre carrying out an extensive CCTV trawl of the area. A drone was flying over the unit when the fire first broke out and weaposve now spoken to the owner who is assisting us with our investigation.

Until Prince Andrew answers detailed questions about the sex offender, his name will forever be dragged through the mud and there is zero prospect of ato public le. When the tales from a young woman who claims Epstein made her have sex with the Prince – which the Prince denies – are so disturbing you’d think he would be hammering on the FBI’s door to clear his name. So let’s end this war of words between the US Ministry of Justice and the Prince. Andrew’s lawyers insist he’s made three offers to help. Well let’s see a no-strings fourth and arrange for an interview in London. We criticise the US for shielding Anne Sacoolas, wanted in the UK over Harry Dunn’s death. The Duke must lead by example, and co-operate fully. Virus farce Quarantine is another failed policy. Forcing those arriving at airports to shut themselves away for two weeks is a blunt instrument riddled with holes. To work, this strategy should have been applied at the start of the pandemic, not now. It also makes no sense to impose this on people from countries with much lower coronavirus rates than our own.  And thirdly, allowing use of public transport, accommodation changes and shopping trips are holes big enough to fly a jumbo jet through.

Among the speakers delivering words of comfort were Mr Floydaposs brother Philonise Floyd and former vice-president Joe Biden. It was Brooke Williams, Mr Floydaposs niece, who stole the show and moved the crowd with her storming speech however. Directing her words to former officer Derek Chauvin, charged with Floydaposs death, she said: He begged and pleaded just for you to get up. But you just pushed harder.

But when has America ever been great  Those four officers were literally on him for nine minutes and none of them showed they have a heart or soul. This is not just a murder, but a hate crime.

Kathy Sullivan, , who reached a depth of ,ft known as ­Challenger Deep, is the eighth person to complete the feat. The first two were Don Walsh and Jacques Picard in , as well as film director James Cameron in . She was joined in the western Pacic Ocean by Victor Vescovo, an explorer funding the mission. They spent about hr min . miles down in the Mariana Trench,  miles southwest of Guam. After taking pictures from the deep-sea research submersible, the Limiting Factor, it took them four hours to resurface. The sub is the first to go repeatedly to the deepest point in the ocean.

But sheaposs said she isnapost going to tell the organisationshe goes under the kne again, saying she wants to step away from the book. Since , Cindy, who is American but now lives in London, has had  operations including three face lts, two nose jobs, implants and a chin reductions. Sheaposs had a series of other non-surgical procedures - including chemical peels and semi-permanant make-up. Cindy, who is now in her s, explained that unfortunately people see the Guinness World Record events as a freak show, and said that while all the other holders were lovely she felt she didnapost belong there.  She now hopes Rodrigo Alves, AKA the Human Ken Doll, will take her record. Speaking in , she told the Sun: I have had more work since setting my last world record, a neck lt, a few tweaks and dozens of non-surgical procedures - I can’t remember all the procedures. It’s like asking someone to remember how many haircuts they’ve had in the last  years. I won’t be officially logging them because I’m sick of being known as a Barbie doll. I don’t want to be involved in a competition. I think some people – like Rodrigo – have procedures just to win the title.“I went for the natural look. There have been claims he is addicted to surgery, I don’t know whether or not he is, but I most certainly am not - the dferences are endless. For me, surgery that isn’t as natural-looking as possible, is a failure. Speaking before her decision to step away from the world of records, she spoke about the honour of being in the famous book. She said: Everybody knows the Guinness World Record book, and when I was a child I used to find it in the news agent every year when it came out and go through it - we all did. We all looked forward to seeing what person was going to be in it. I never dreamt of being in it because didnapost come from any sort of extraordinary background.

With the big cats seemingly happy to mind their own business as people inside the vehicle capture the moment on cameras, footage shows one man sitting within touching distance of the lions with the window wide open.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

swim and kayak, is part of the proposals revealed by the local authority with a series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the

other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek

This proves that Chloe can manage her workload on her own and keep good routines.ldquoShe has been a joy to work with.Chloe is also very pleased with her achievements and claims that the lockdown actually made it easier for her to work on her assessments.She said: ldquoIt is quite relaxing to study during lockdown.ldquoI have been able to do things at my own pace and it has given me something positive to focus on which can help me move towards my future, she added.In addition to her Animal Care units, the former Ross High School student has also completed a self-evaluation course.Through these courses, she says she has met new friends and been able to talk to people she wouldnrsquot have talked to before.She said: ldquoBridges Project has helped me become more confident, especially when talking in front of other people and when expressing what I want to say.Ms Kerr added: ldquoEast Lothian Works and her counsellor have helped Chloe a lot, and done a great job.East Lothian Works has also organised for Chloe to volunteer in Oxfamrsquos Haddington shop. This has been another good experience which has given the teenager more responsibility and an insight into the retail world.Even though she has been enjoying her volunteering experience, Chloe still hopes that she can continue to work with animals in the future. She already takes care of her dogs, and also has a rabbit.Ms Kerr said: ldquoChloe is absolutely devoted to her rabbit and it must have a lovely time with her. She is very caring and loves animals.The teenager is now hoping to study something related to animals at college in the near future.ldquoI believe I will be nervous going to college but it will be much more enjoyable than it would have been before.

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county. But this journey has been very painful and costly.There has been a clear campaign against The Catrsquos Pyjamas to the point of it being a vendetta.Objectors have ly contacted the police to report noise when there was none ndash veried by Police Scotland ndash just to get it on the record ahead of the licensing board hearing. I need to take time to reflect on everything that has happened, to reflect on the impact that it has had on myself and my family. I need to investigate whether another location would be better orthe business model should change.At the moment all I can say is sincere thank you to everyone who has supported this venture from the outset and especially to my family for all the blood, sweat, tears and cash they have put into creating this very special place.Ross Hardie,The Catrsquos Pyjamas,Belhaven,Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"kids-create-chain-key-workers-tesco-superstore","story":"They were asked to create a window display for the store by its community champion, Jane Shepherd, and were rewarded with some treats.The hub, based at Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, provides learning and childcare.

They are a giant of nature, yet also incredibly intelligent. They feel emotion like we do, in fact possibly more so as the emotional part of their brain is even more developed than that of humans.The old saying that ldquoan elephant never forgets is rooted in this fact. An elephantrsquos emotional intelligence comes from its ability to remember and recall distant memory. Like humans, an elephantrsquos way of being is mostly learned in early le, rather than just based on instinct.They are therefore highly sensitive creatures, influenced and affected by what they experience just as we are.Irsquove heard dferent versions of this tale, and here I have peppered it very slightly with my own style:Once, a king in ancient India owned an elephant. This royal elephant was the joy not just of the king, but also his people.The trainer would ride the elephant every day along the streets. She was a magnicent sight, and children would run out to wave and watch the elephant go by. The trainer took a dferent route each day so people in dferent neighbourhoods all had a chance to enjoy the spectacle.The people felt a real love and affinity for the elephant. Despite her size and strength, she was gentle and affectionate with the people. She would pat children carefully on their heads with her trunk and took care in where she walked.The elephant made people feel safe. More than once she had saved a child from drowning in the nearby river, or from a predator from the jungle. She was a sacred animal to the people.But then people began to notice a change in the elephantrsquos behaviour. She became aggressive and unpredictable. Instead of being patient with the children she knocked them out of her way with her trunk. Instead of being careful where she walked, she deliberately trampled on peoplersquos gardens.The trainer tried his best to control the elephant, but she seemed like a dferent animal. He couldnrsquot understand why she was behaving so dferently.It just got worse, until one day the elephant suddenly set off on a charge and rampaged through the streets, trumpeting loudly as she charged at the terried people, almost killing some of them.The king was horried and ordered the elephant to be confined to her stables. With dficulty she was finally brought under control and locked in.ldquoWhat is going on  asked the king to the trainer.ldquoI have no idea your majesty he replied, ldquoitrsquos asshe is a dferent elephant.ldquoPerhaps the elephant is ill in some way  suggested one of the kingrsquos advisors. But the vet found nothing physically wrong.Then the trainer suggested asking an old man who lived in the jungle as ldquohe is known for his wisdom in understanding animals, perhaps he will know what the cause of this is.So the king sent a messenger and the old man came to the royal palace.ldquoCan you help  asked the king.The old man asked to be left alone with the elephant for a while.When he ed he looked at the king and said: ldquoWhatever is wrong is something that cannot be seen. I must spend some time with the elephant to understand what is troubling her.And so the old man decided to watch over the elephant that night. He smeared himself in mud to mask his scent and hid in a corner of the stable.It was late evening when he heard voices.A group of men had entered the stables from a small side door. They were a gang of murderers. They were using the royal elephant stable as a place to meet and plan their activities. And in so doing they recounted stories of their deeds.Their leader was a man with a cold and ruthless heart. He told stories about his le and deeds, of how hersquod murdered and tortured people he didnrsquot like. Members of his gang laughed and shared their tales too, likewise full of hatred and cruelty.The elephant slumbered as these tales were told, but they were unknowingly heard by her. When the elephant woke the following morning, the tales of hate and violence still swirled in her mind.The old man went to the king.ldquoYour majesty, there are two things you must do to cure the elephant.ldquoThe first is to remove the murderers who meet in the stables at night. The second is you must find the kindest people, who live their lives with love and understanding. Then ask them to meet at night in the stable as the elephant sleeps and tell each other stories from their lives tales of love and understanding. If you do this, then the elephant will be cured.The king looked bemused.ldquoI will most certainly remove the murderers, he said, ldquobut are you saying that stories will cure the elephant ldquoYes, your majesty, replied the old man, ldquobut the right stories. You see we are made from the stories we hear.He went on: ldquoIf we constantly hear tales of hatred and violence then those stories paint our vision of le with fear, loathing and cruelty.ldquoButwe mostly hear tales of love and understanding, then our mind is coloured with kindness for others, and for ourselves.ldquoWe are affected by the stories we hear, evenwe donrsquot realise we have been listening to them.ldquoYour elephant was unknowingly listening to tales of hatred and killing every night as she slept. So her mind was filled with hate and distrust her vision of the world changed and so did her behaviour.ldquoIf she hears good stories then she will eventually become her kind self again.The king nodded in understanding and agreed to act on this. Within a few weeks the elephantrsquos behaviour had changed for the better.ldquoYou are indeed wise in the ways of elephants, the king said to the old man.ldquoThe truth in this is not just for elephants, the old man replied.ldquoPeople are like your elephant the stories they hear will paint their world and affect how they live in it.The king nodded once again.ldquoMy job is done, said the old man, ldquoI will nowto the forest.ldquoBy the way, your elephant will have a calf, and her calf must hear good stories too.ldquoHow can I pay you for your wisdom  asked the king.The old man thought for a moment, then said: ldquoBe a king who tells good stories tales of kindness and understanding. And be a good listener to the stories told by your people.ldquoThen you will be a truly great leader and your kingdom will flourish and be a happier place.ldquoIf you do that, it will be my greatest reward."},{"url":null,"title":"strawberry-moon-2020-time-see-skies-uk","story":"The Strawberry Moon coincideswith summer solstice once every  years when the moon is situated on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun - whichfully illuminates its round shape.Unfortunately, despite its fruity name, the moon may notappear in warm colours as we would expect.The lunar event got its name fromNative American tribes, who used the moon to help them indicate when fruit would be ripened.What does NASA say about the Strawberry Moon As described by NASA: ldquoThe Maine Farmers Almanac first published Indian names for the full moons in the s.ldquoAccording to this almanac, the full moon in June or the last full Moon of spring is known as the Strawberry Moon, a name universal to just about every Algonquin tribe.ldquoThe name comes from the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries in northeastern North America.The Strawberry Moon has also been referred to as the Hot Moon.So, when can I see it You can expect to see the spectacular lunar event at about .pm BST tonight .According to the Royal Greenwich Observatory in London, the Strawberry Moon will last for up to three orfour days."},{"url":null,"title":"black-lives-matter-donate-help-get-diverse-books-primary-schools","story":"The fund -which has raised over pound, since it was created on Wednesday, June  - aims to help black, Asian and minority ethnicstudents to feel represented by their school libraries.The initiative was inspired by protests that have taken place across the world calling for justice after the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May .Who created the fund Scott Emmons, who created the fund, told the PA news agency:ldquoTherersquos a lack of books in primary schools where not only can teachers teach the white students about these issues, but also the BAME students are severely under-represented in the books that they have.\"Mr Emmons, , who lives in Wanstead, added: ldquoI went to the protest on Wednesday in Hyde Park and came away feeling so energised.

The First Minister has taken control of the management of the pandemic in Scotland. She has stated on many occasions that she takes the decisions and the responsibility and she has fronted every daily press conference, a feat of stamina and leadership that is admirable in itself. Butthe ldquoelite has failed, so has the First Minister.Its not aswe were not warned. There were at least four reports, three specically for the Scottish Government, that told of lack or equipment and processes to handle a pandemic, but it appears that the warnings were ignored, and the necessary preparations were never made. It is also obvious that the UK did not lock down quickly enough, but the first signicant outbreak was in Edinburgh and it was covered up by the First Minister. Had it been known to the public, pressure for an earlier lockdown would have been likely. Instead concerts and sporting events were allowed to continue, including the Scotland-France rugby on March . The Old Firm game of March  was cancelled by the SPFL, not the Scottish Government. BBC Scotlands Disclosure programme calculated that a two-week delay could have cost , Scottish lives over the following month.The lack of preparedness and delayed lockdown affected the UK and the devolved administrations in equal measure, resulting in lack of PPE, hospital beds, ventilators and other necessary equipment. The urging of the WHO to ldquotest, test, test was ignored in Scotland as much as England, and current testing levels are lower in Scotland. Infections are at the same rate in Scotland. The death rate from the virus is the same. Excess deaths are the same. Deaths in care homes are slightly worseanything. Discharging potentially infected people, and therefore the virus, from hospitals into care homes is the same. There is the same callousness in refusing to move the elderly sick from care homes to hospital. The result in all of the UK has been more infections and extra deaths.A good comparator of success or failure is New Zealand, with the same population as Scotland but with  deaths compared to our ,. It is dficult to see how such breath-taking levels of incompetence bolster any case for ldquoindependence except with those obsessed with it in the first place. Andthe failure of an ldquoelite is the cause, as Mr McKenna suggests, then the Tory elite in Westminster and the SNP elite in Holyrood would seem to be more or less equally culpable.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.READING Kevin McKennas column on Saturday made me wonder: able writer for your paper that he is, does he ever read your paper Your front-page lead story in the very same editionhad already demolished his assertions. Tom Gordonrsquos compelling exposures showed that the Scottish Governmentrsquos suppression of information Scottish people are entitled to know, as well as the damaging untruths we had been fed, are a cause for great concern.The fact that an incompetent elite in charge of the Covid- virus in London is leading to lack of trust, hardly confirms that similar ldquoelites are not mishandling the crisis where.Your revelation that the Scottish Government shared the Iris Report in February  with the UK Governmentshowed that both Tory and SNP Governments are jointly culpable of a disastrous lack of preparations for a pandemic that was predictable and predicted. You rightly report the view that ldquoalarm bells were ringing for both the Scottish and UK governments. Surely objective readers have concluded that both administrations failed catastrophically, resulting in a huge number of lives being lost.Elsewhere in the same edition the impact on Scottish education was exposed in David Bolrsquos coruscating article headed ldquoPupils have been left severely traumatised\". Again an indication that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos handling of these matters is no better than Boris Johnsonrsquos.Moreover, Saturdayrsquos Herald was not a one-off. Switching scores of frail elderly patients from hospitals into care homes, without their or their familiesrsquo agreement, is surely beyond defending far less a case for independence.The consequences of the Nike Conference in Edinburgh and the cover-up which followed will not go away.Boris Johnsonrsquos appalling handling of the Dominic Cummings affair remains without justication. But anyone who followed Ms Sturgeonrsquos attempts, for a whole day, to seek to retain her hapless adviser, until her own career was clearly in jeopardy, will hardly be convinced that the First Ministerrsquos motivation was at all laudable.Mr McKennarsquos repeated description of the many who disagree with separatism as ldquoUnionists is offensive to those who understand its connotations. The clear majority of Scots ndash amounting to an almost  per cent majority ndash to reject the ldquoonce in a letime choice should not have their views distorted. We choose to love our country, Scotland, and to work with others in the United Kingdom to achieve a better society and continue to hold to account an ldquoelite ldquowhether it exists in Holyrood or Westminster.Lest I am thought to be over-critical of Kevin McKenna, I welcomed his recollection that a Labour leader, Clement Attlee saved Britain, including Scotland, from the horrors of fascism by rejecting Lord Halax. I imagine Sir Starmer would agree wholly with that,not the rest of the article.Tom Clarke, Coatbridge.TOM Gordonrsquos exposeacute lays bare the damage being done to the relationship between the people of Scotland and those who govern us.His revelation that almost , patients have acquired Covid- and more than  have died after being admitted to hospital for other conditions is deplorable. But the attempt by Jeane Freeman, the Health Secretary, to appear to camouflage this and to speak instead of  ldquoincidents of Covid- on other wards is despicable.AC Grayling has previously written that ldquoin the related arts of politics and government, judicious economies with truth are a stock in trade, and the learned philosopher may well be right, but onlywe let them get away with it.When dealing with the impact of this pandemic, we need our leaders to tell us in plain language exactly how it is, no matter how bad. If they do not, and others have to speak truth to power, then our government has failed us.Bob Scott, Drymen.AN active No campaigner in  I now find myself unable to bear the thought of being subjected to a future of relentless mis-governance by such second-rate politicians as make up the current Westminster Cabinet.On the other hand, my principal concern about independence has always been the impact of the inevitable financial turmoil on those in poverty and otherwise deprived and powerless after a decade of Conservative austerity. The Yes SNP Green coalition has been unwilling to acknowledge, far less address, that issue.And so I believe that the Government and people of Scotland must find a way of addressing the issue of how we can deal with the consequences of being part of the Dystopian DysUnited Kingdomwith its architectsrsquo rejection of the UK values its citizens once believed were at least implied in its unwritten constitution.I find myself thinking that a resounding vote for an SNP Green alliance next year with a correspondingly overwhelming rejection of Jackson Carlawrsquos Conservatives would be the only way to put the necessary shot over the bows of the DDUK. A risky strategy for a non-nationalist  Probably, but presently I see no alternative when faced with a Government determined to create an ldquoindependent England founded on closer ties with a Trumpian United States.John Milne, Uddingston.THE political consequences of Brexit have so far been more rapid and lethal than its economic damage, leaving Britain with a Gilbert-and-Sullivan style leadership of spectacular incompetence during one of the worst public health crises in recent history.Out of , excess deaths, , could have been avoided had we acted like any other European and East Asian nation. On a single day last week,  people died from coronavirus in the UK ndash more than in all  EU countries over the same  hours.North and south of the Border, as government failures multiply, the default position is evasion and denial. In the past it didnt really matter who was nominally running the country as we had one of the worldrsquos most effective administrative machine.Today a weak, politicised civil service outsources to incompetent companies while co-ordinating existing organisations, such as NHS laboratories or local public health departments, is far beyond an organisation which is afraid to speak truth to power.Rev Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.AM I the only one noticing the disparities between how the UK Government deals with the EU trade deal talks compared to those with the US There seems to be no real will to engage with the EU: accusations of truculence and blocking deals are branded on both sides. Time is running out, yet there seems no political will on the side of the UK to extend the talks despite the Covid crisis.On the other hand, trade talks with the US are going swimmingly: the firm promise of Boris Johnson not to open the UK market to chlorinated chicken has already been broken hormone-fed beef will no doubt follow. All the rules, regulations and in particular: protections that our membership of the EU brought with it will be broken, one by one.

So both in my role as Commissioner and as a member of the public, Irsquove been considering how public authorities have adapted their approach to sharing information of all kinds since the impact of this pandemic began to be felt ndash and how they will do so in weeks and months ahead.Inevitably we all have questions about the decisions being made by our leaders and public services, and never more so than at a time when those decisions, sadly, may mean the dference between le and death. This is why it is so vital that Scotlandrsquos law ensures everyone has a right to seek information from public authorities, and ndash with only very few, limited exceptions ndash to receive it.For some public authorities, changes brought about by the current disruptions will make this challenging . However, not all will be impacted by the pandemic in the same way, and every authority must continue to respond to FOI requests promptly, and in any event within the  working day timeline.The Scottish Parliament has, however, acknowledged the challenges faced by authorities and has accepted that sometimes, even when responding promptly, it will not be possible to meet this timeline. The current emergency legislation therefore allows me, in certain circumstances relating to the pandemic, to decide that an authority has not breached the law evenit has failed to respond to a request within  working days. I have issued detailed guidance on the emergency changes to FOI law on my website, and will continue to enforce these provisions firmly and fairly.Crucially, FOI law also places a duty on public authorities to publish information about the work they do, the decisions they take and the services they provide ndash in a proactive way and not just when requested. This duty remains unchanged but is more important now than ever.Since we are all coming to accept that the disruption caused by the pandemic will continue for some time, I hope and expect that public authorities in Scotland will respond by adapting their ways of working, learning from this challenge, and updating their practices to ensure that people can easily access the information that matters to them ndash during this dficult time and beyond.By publishing key information proactively, clearly and speedily, authorities can both reduce the time they spend responding to requests for information later, and promote the transparent culture we all want and expect in our public services.The importance of this point was clearly highlighted by MSPs in the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Public Audit and Post-Legislative Scrutiny Committee last month, in their report on the current state of FOI law. Although the Committeersquos report was agreed before the outbreak of Covid- in Scotland, many of their recommendations highlight the real opportunities we have not only to maintain, but to improve, access to information for people in Scotland, and I look forward to helping them become a reality.Ultimately, we ndash citizens, public authorities and regulators ndash are in this together. In the face of all the disruption and uncertainty we are living through, we have a chance to change the way we understand and interact with one another about key decisions and services for the better. I hope and believe that with some determination, hard work and open dialogue, we can make a real dference.Daren Fitzhenry is Scottish Information Commissioner.

And to be fair to Mr Blair, who had only just become Prime Minister, the terms of the settlement were largely set by the negotiations during Margaret Thatcherrsquos time in government which were initially led by Sir Edward Heath, with his stellar record of undermining UK interests. Standing up to China, admittedly, wasnrsquot an easy task then ndash when Deng told Mrs Thatcher he could ldquotake the whole lot in an afternoon she admitted there wasnrsquot anything she could do to stop it ndash and it may be even harder now.Fat Pangdid try to do something to safeguard the interests of the citizens of Hong Kong by expanding the democratic franchise but, as is now apparent, you canrsquot really do a great deal to protect human rights when the incoming government is a dictatorship.So the current Governmentrsquos proposed provision that,China imposes its national security law ndashwith extradition to the mainland ndash all Hong Kong holders of a British National Overseas passportshould be entitled to come to the UK with the right to work for at least  months is a welcome step.Of course, it would have been betterwersquod simply offered that ndash as some of us argued at the time ndash to all Hong Kong residents about  years ago, just as it would have been betterwersquod extended a similar offer to other Commonwealth citizens, rather than Theresa Mayrsquos policy of illegally deporting members of the Windrush generation. But itrsquos not just a question of it being the right thing to do it would very obviously be in the countryrsquos best interests.One result of Brexit is that opposition to immigration has fallen: according to some surveys, from about  per cent a decade ago to about  per cent now. Though I regret the end of free movement with the EU countries, it at least has the consequence that the UK can control immigration. That shouldnrsquot mean limiting it on the contrary, it should allow us to open our borders to necessary workers, and the best talent from anywhere in the world.The current population of Hong Kong, one of the wealthiest and healthiest on the planet, looks a particularly attractive prospect. But itrsquos no accident that a lump of rock in the Pearl River Delta, with no advantages other than a good natural harbour, should have become so successful.Hong Kong exists because of trade. Any place without natural resourcescan only survive through trade. As Tai-Pan, James Clavellrsquos fictionalised version of its origins, depicts it, that was initially smuggling, piracy, tea and opium.What a boon its industrious and inventive population would be to our economy. But we should go further. There is the opportunity not only to accommodate the people of Hong Kong, but to replicate the conditions that made it so successful.The obvious thing to do is to set up some new jurisdiction within the UK, but modelled on Cowperthwaitersquos principles: the Isle of Man, Gibraltar and the Channel Islands are already precedents for such a distinction. A low-tax freeport and financial centre right on our doorstep would have obvious benefits for the rest of the country, while,it were very lightly regulated, it would create housing and employment opportunities not just for immigrants, but for UK citizens.It could potentially create exactly the sort of major, galvanising transformation of the economy that would lt us out of the recession that is certain to follow our current crisis, and to provide a shot in the arm and signal of intent that ought to follow our departure from the EU. The fact that the EU would hate the idea might also be a useful point in trade negotiations.Whatrsquos more,located in the right sort of area, it could realign the whole country, balancing the disproportionate dominance of London. Ideally, for trading reasons, it should be on the coast and near a major airport. For unionist reasons, but also in the interests of geographical spread of wealth from London towards the north and west in general, it would be particularly goodit were located in Scotland.You wouldnrsquot need much space: Hong Kong island is only about  sq km, and the new free city could start off quite a bit smaller. A modest start would be to transform Millport into something more along the lines of Singapore, exempting it from UK and Scottish taxes. If that turns out to be so successful that it outgrows Great Cumbrae, the next step would be to annex Rothesay.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

In one, an enslaved man is whipped by another man wearing a turban - an attempt at whitewashing the extent of Scotlands involvement while pointing a bloody finger at middle eastern and north African slave traders.The propagandist statue was built to distance Glasgow from its slaving past - here was a Scot who not only discovered the continent but saved Africans through Christianity in the process, so the story goes. Except, he had a \"tour guide\" says Ms Njenga, who cleared the explorers path through the undergrowth, as seen on the statue. \"He discovered nothing.\"Its vital to be clear-eyed about this history, she says. There lies real threat in \"the lingering stereotypes that the conditions of slavery were better than living in Africa\".In the th century, Scotland saw the grotesque wealth England was amassing as a result of the triangular slave trade - enslaved people exchanged for goods then sold into servitude and their crops ed to be traded.Scots were so well regarded for their cruelty they were in high demand to run plantations where the average survival rate for enslaved people was three to five years, they were worked so hard.The proximity of tobacco merchants Andrew Buchanan and Richard Oswalds graves to the Cathedral - one directly outside the entrance, the other in the nave - show exactly how much clout they held in the city. These men, and the others like them, wielded political power, Buchanan as Lord Provost and Oswald, as one of the brokers of s Treaty of Paris.:Every Scottish street linked to slave-trade revealed - find your addressDespite media publications at the time of Abolition in  professing that \"not one brick of Glasgow\" was built on the broken backs of enslaved people, the history books beg to dfer.A sum of pound million, or pound billion in todayrsquos money, was paid to the slavers - despite their offensive wealth - to compensate for lost trade. A tax only paid off in  by all of us.Ms Blake says she balks when she hears the citys slogan, Let Glasgow Flourish.She said: \"Let Glasgow flourish on the children thrown as bait to the crocodiles, on the women being raped and torn away from their breastfeeding children. When people say there were not involved, they were involved. They were involved up to their neck.\"It was not only the wealthy merchants the streets are named after, Ingram, Glassford, Buchanan and Dundas, who were culpable, but the Glaswegians who worked in administrative roles and processed the tobacco and sugar that passed through.: Boris Johnson does not believe UK is lsquoracist countryrsquoThe city had a \"disproportionate\" involvement with the slave economies, despite its calculated cover up.The Stirling family who held the estates of Keir, near Dunblane and Cadder, in the north of Glasgow hastily changed their family crest post abolition, removing the silhouette of a Black mans head signying their trade and replacing it with a gleaming white swan, as can be seen in the stained glass windows of the Cathedral.The main thoroughfares built by merchants so they could have comfortable passage from their palatial homes to the counting rooms that totted up their wealth, the parks built as play areas for their wives and children and the commercial buildings rising from the piles of bodies of enslaved Africans are all a legacy of Glasgow, and Scotlands, heavy involvement in the slave trade.It is a history that needs to be remembered, argue Ms Blake and Ms Njenga. Particularly in a cultural climate that is leaning to the right and elevating politicians and commentators that trade in racism, hatred and misogyny.Ms Blake said: \"Slavery is not in the past because even today people are benefitting from it.\"If this history was known a lot of stereotypes would not be as strong. These stereotypes are harmful to everybody\"After visiting the site of the Tontine Heads, where sugar was traded, the Old College, Glasgow Universitys first incarnation, and the Merchant City area, the tour comes to a close outside the Gallery of Modern Art, built as an extension to sugar and tobacco trader William Cunninghames mansion.Ms Njenga said: \"Glasgow used to be  streets but because of the wealth of the slave traders it expanded. Without slavery, Glasgow wouldnt exist. The fabric of this pace is weaved by these people. We have to push for institutional change and change how we think about race.\"This article was written in October  during Black History Month."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-nicola-sturgeon-optimistic-easing-lockdown-next-week","story":"The First Minister said the disease was ldquoin retreat, meaning it should be possible to move to the second stage of her four-phase exit strategy on June .Phase  could see two households meeting indoors again, subject to social distancing, larger groups meeting outdoors, and the re-opening of beer gardens and outdoor restaurants.Professional sport could also restart, marriages and civil partnerships resume, and smaller stores re-open, subject to physical distancing.However Mr Sturgeon had tougher news for the , people most at risk from Covid, the shielding group, who may have to observe a tighter lockdown to July .Although the group, who have been told to stay indoors throughout the outbreak, will be able to go outside for exercise, they are still advised not to socialise with other households.The measures are more restrictive than for those shielding south of the Border.At the Scottish Government daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the number of people known to have died from a laboratory-confirmed case of Covid was ,, the same as on Saturday.Northern Ireland also recorded a second day without deaths, while the number of fatalities in England fell to , the lowest daily increase since March , just before the lockdown started.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"No coronavirus deaths in Scotland for second consecutive day\",\"description\": \"No coronavirus deaths in Scotland for second consecutive day\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media MWrfcf poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests MWrfcf.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoThis is the second day in a row that no deaths have been registered in the preceding  hours.

It is absolutely devastating.ldquoThatrsquos why Irsquom so determined that we go forward in a way and at a pace that gets the economy back into operation as quickly as possible.ldquoBut the point I canrsquot escape is thatwe get that pace wrong andwe go more quickly than we should, then we risk setting things back.The Scottish Retail Consortiumrsquos David Lonsdale said: ldquoThose stores still to be allowed to re-open are working hard to get ready to do so safely, putting in place the necessary social distancing and hygiene measures to protect customers and staff.ldquoWhenever that day comes, retail will be ready to play its part in getting Scotlandrsquos economy moving again.

It only came to light following a BBC investigation last month.Dr Smith said genetic analysis had linked a further three possible cases to the conference, but two have now been discounted while the third ldquoshows similarities with those associated with the conference, but no direct or indirect link to the conference has been established.He added: ldquoAll show similarities with a viral lineage found in continental Europe.ldquoHowever, this particular sub-lineage has not been detected in Scotland since the end of March.ldquoThis suggests that the actions taken by the [infection management team] were successful in curtailing spread and have led to the eradication of this particular viral lineage, with no evidence of any wider outbreak associated with it in Scotland since that time.: Edinburgh doctors see big drop in broken bones from assualts and road collisions since start of CovidIt comes as a study from Hard Medical School suggested that the new virus could have emerged in Wuhan, China as far back as September or October last year, based on a ldquodramatic increase in traffic to the cityrsquos major hospitals around that time, and a spike in queries on a Chinese internet for ldquocertain symptoms that would later be determined as closely associated with the novel coronavirus.China did not formally noty the World Health Organization of the new disease until December .Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stressed that Scotland is continuing to see a ldquoclear downward trend in Covid deaths. It came as she reported seven new deaths in patients known to have the virus, after two consecutive days with none.

We are rightly proud in the Northern Isles of having some of the highest standards of produce in the world. Farmers and consumers alike deserve peace of mind about fair standards and fair prices for the food we produce and eat.He continued: “I am astonished that the government has leapt directly from denying earlier this year that lower food standards would be permitted to defending this policy turn wholeheartedly. Undercutting farmers and crofters is not what was promised about the “brave new world” of future trade deals.“It is concerning that the government seems more interested in carrying water for Donald Trump and his #America First# mentality than in supporting our farmers. The government should be accountable to the people they represent, not the whims of US negotiators.”Speaking in the House earlier in the week, Mr Carmichael highlighted the potential impact to farmers and crofters in the Northern Isles: “I would like to hear what the Government’s response is to press reports today that the Government are set to open British markets to food products produced to lower US standards as part of the trade deal with Donald Trump. This was the rhetoric we were given by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: he told us that there would never be chlorinated chicken on our plate.“Now, in fact, we hear that as a consequence of the so-called dual tarf process it is quite possible that we will see such products being imported to this country. In fact, we are told that the Secretary of State for International Trade is arguing that these tarfs should be reduced to zero over  years, giving farmers time to adjust to the new “normal”.“For the farmers and crofters in my constituency, it will be a hard reality for them to survive in. Because we are a long distance from the market, we have not gone for mass-produced food. We have sought to improve the quality of the products we have and put into market with a view to export. Tarfs on those export markets will be absolutely fatal to the agricultural interests of the highlands and islands.”Responding for the government, the Paymaster General, Penny Mordaunt MP, said: “I fully understand why he may be sceptical about trusting the government, but trust the people. They value animal welfare, we should trust the consumer and there are massive opportunities for our farmers for rest of world trade.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the Sandwick Manse, he kept a daily record for  years, beginning in , and became a recognised expert on Scotland’s weather.After Clouston’s death, the station moved around Orkney but kept going right up until WWII. Magnus Spence ran it in Deerness for almost thirty years,  – . His son, Magnus Thorfinn Spence, was Chief Meteorologist for Bomber Command during WWII. With very neat symmetry, the story now moves to the other end of the world # to the South Orkney Islands. Base Orcadas is an Argentinian weather station but it was founded in  by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, led by William Spiers Bruce. His grandmother was Charity Isbister, whose father Caleb owned Ness Farm, Stromness. Spiers Bruce went to the Antarctic as a scientist on a whaling expedition in  and became fascinated by the polar regions. He went on expeditions to the Arctic and, when he couldn’t get there, he went to the top of Ben Nevis, which had snow cover for  days of the year. An Observatory had been built there in  by the Scottish Meteorological Society, to try to learn more about weather patterns. The first Superintendent was RTOmond, the son of Robert Omond from Kirkwall, who became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Mary Traill, daughter of Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, . Omond was involved with the Observatory right from its planning stages. Ill health forced him down from the summit after seven years, but he remained in overall charge until the Observatory closed in . William Spiers Bruce had applied to join Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic. When, despite being one of the most experienced Polar scientists in the country, his application was rejected, he raised the funds for an expedition supported by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of - is not as famous as those of Scott and Shackleton but it has been described as one of the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientic expeditions of the age. As well as establishing the weather station, the expedition brought back a large number of botanical, biological, zoological and geological samples. The house built for the men and their instruments was called Omond House. As well as giving Spiers Bruce a lot of practical and scientic advice, Omond had given a very sizeable donation to the expedition.The Ben Nevis Observatory only lasted eighteen years and only had three observers so it is strange that there is still more Orcadian involvement.

The minister has agreed to look at Mr McArthur’s suggestion and highlighted that the government is looking at a range of ways to offer support to farmers.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “The COVID- outbreak has forced ious initiatives planned by SNH and the Orkney Greylag Goose Management group to be put on hold. As a result, local farmers have been faced with having to spend more time and resources trying to keep resident greylag geese numbers under control.“I know from seeing first-hand the impact that greylag geese can have on crops and farmland. Over recent years, as the resident Greylag population has increased, so too has the damage and the cost of trying to address the problem. “It would seem sensible, therefore, to use any funding earmarked for the earlier control measures to help reduce the financial burden on farmers having to take steps themselves. This could include contributing to the cost of cartridges, but there may be other options available.“I’m pleased that the minister responded positively to this suggestion and agree to explore the options for providing such support, as well as wider efforts to bring Orkney’s resident Greylag goose population down to more sustainable levels.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After the Republic announced bars can operate as restaurants from June , and all will be allowed to open on July , there is pressure on the Stormont Executive, which met on Monday, to reveal a timeline. It#s expected to announce further rule relaxations on Thursday.But according to some publicans, it is logical for Northern Ireland to operate in tandem with the south. While pub owners have received no advice and guidance on re-opening, they have their own thoughts on how it can happen, and what the experience will be like.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseHow pubs could work when they reopen.  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappHow pubs could work when they reopen. Pedro Donald, who owns the Sunflower and the American Bar in Belfast, said the lack of guidelines makes it dficult to plan ahead, other than knowing staff will have to keep their hands clean and sanitised, and that there will be social distancing.As far as putting structures up, including screens, we are not going to do that unless we know we need to, said Mr Donald.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePedro Donald of Sunflower Bar FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPedro Donald of Sunflower BarHe added: We will not be doing sessions initially as they would need to be spread out and space is going to be a premium. The hospitality industry has warned that pubs and restaurants may be unable to reopenthe two metre social distancing rule is not reduced. The two metre rule will not work inside Mr Donald#s bars, both of which are small two-floor spaces, although the Sunflower also has a popular large outdoor area. If that rule remains in place, he said would be able to host about four people.Mr Donald said he will not be inviting or encouraging crowds to come to his premises, but he is not sure whether there will be a big rush to the pub. A lot of people might see how it is working, while others will want to go right back, he said. The Belfast bar owner expects to have the same number of staff, with less behind the bar but more on the door and policing the toilets.Willie Jack, owner of the Harp Bar, the Dark Horse and the Duke Of York, among other establishments, believes it makes sense for bars north and south to open at the same time, rather than potentially see pubs in Londonderry and Bundoran working on a dferent schedule.He believes Monday, July  is a sensible date as it would be better not to open on a pay day at the end of the month, a weekend, or a holiday like the Twelfth. A wet Monday or Tuesday night when there is no pressure, he said.The publican expects no standing or sitting at the bar, and customers being served at certain points then ing to their table. He noted that certain countries and the World Health Organisation have endorsed the one-metre rule.There will be no live music in his venues initially, then possibly single singer songwriters. Mr Jack expects capacity to be reduced to between  and % depending on what rules are put in place by the Executive.Prices might have to go up, he said, adding that he does not want to see customers partitioned by screens.A number of his establishments are in the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast, and he wants to work with the City Council to pedestrianise the area in the evening and at weekends. Managing taxi ranks and portable toilets will be vitalthat happens, Mr Jack added. Otherwise, staff are likely to be washing hands every half hour, using sanitiser but not wearing gloves or masks, the publicans said.On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the two-metre rule and said businesses may have to rely on their ingenuity to operate within the restriction. He said the rule was under review, but, ultimately, it isn#t the rule that#s the challenge to the opening of hospitality in a safe way, it#s the virus. And in the Republic, Business Minister Heather Humphreys said yesterday that the two-metre rule may be changed provided that coronavirus figures go in the right direction and the transmission rate remains low.

now heading up over half of Northern Ireland#s  councils - holding the top positions in seven local authorities.DUP councillors will wear the chain of office in four councils during  , and the UUP in three, while Sinn Fein and the SDLP have two each.The last fortnight has seen the election of mayors and council chairs across Northern Ireland.The Local GovernmentAct states that councils# annual general meetings must take place in June.However, this year the Covid- pandemic means mayors and deputy mayors begin their year in office in unique circumstances as the first to be inaugurated through a virtual meeting streamed live online.Councils are permitted to postpone their AGM up to September  but only one - Antrim and Newtownabbey - has chosen to wait until the autumn to elect its new UUP mayor and a deputy from the SDLP.Ulster Unionist Chris Smyth, a psychology researcher at Ulster University, was selected as the new chair in Fermanagh and Omagh and at  is the youngest councillor to take on the role this year. Read More Frank McCoubrey, first single dad to be Belfast Lord Mayor, vows to build bridges across cityLike many incoming mayors, he made his maiden speech to an almost empty chamber while his council colleagues followed proceedings remotely at home due to coronavirus restrictions. His deputy for the coming year is the SDLP#s John Coyle. The pandemic also meant the usual traditions were abandoned when DUP councillor Frank McCoubrey was installed as Lord Mayor in Belfast City Hall. His predecessor did not place the chain of office around Mr McCoubrey#s shoulders rather, the city#s new first citizen removed it from a plinth and did so himself.There were no handshakes from fellow councillors but a round of applause as SDLP councillor Paul McCusker was also installed as Belfast#s Deputy Lord Mayor. Ards and North Down has elected two DUP councillors - Trevor Cummings and Nigel Edmund - as mayor and deputy mayor respectively for the coming year. It#s a similar story in Lisburn and Castlereagh, which selected former Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble#s son Nicholas as its new mayor alongside his deputy and party colleague, Jenny Palmer.Mid and East Antrim will be represented by a Carrickfergus duo - DUP member Peter Johnston will be mayor with Ulster Unionist Andrew Wilson his deputy. Causeway Coast and Glens held its AGM last night when the DUP#s Mark Fielding took over the chairman#s role, while Tom McKeown of the UUP will be the deputy.Meanwhile SDLP councillor Brian Tierney took over the reins in Derry City and Strabane and he will be supported in his role by the DUP#s Graham Warke.The SDLP#s Laura Devlin heads Newry, Mourne and Down, assisted by the UUP#s Harold McKee as deputy chair. Councillors from Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists take over the top roles on two councils - Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, and Mid Ulster - with Sinn Fein mayors Kevin Savage and Cathal Mallaghan working alongside UUP members Kyle Savage and Meta Graham.

Aisling Quinn and Danielle Harkin from Carndonagh, both completed the Adult Learning University Access Diploma in Combined Studies at NWRC, which provides students who have been out of education, a pathway to Higher Education and University study. Aisling now works as a nurse at Buncrana Community Hospital, while younger sister Danielle is working overseas as a Cath Lab nurse in Australia. NWRC is currently accepting applications for the new college semester in September , and both sisters, who went on to study Nursing Degrees at the University of Ulster at Magee, said it was the perfect stepping stone to help themto education after a gap of several years, and go on to their dream careers. googletag.cmd.push Mum of three Aisling, who now lives in Malin, said she always wanted to be a nurse. She explained: “After school I did not feel ready to start my nursing journey and went on to do a pre-nursing course, but I always knew I wouldone day. As a mature student I researched courses to help me gain entry, and the Access Diploma in Combined Studies in NWRC kept popping up. After not studying for  years it was the perfect course to get me back into learning mode and prepare me for the Degree course I wished to pursue. googletag.cmd.push “The lecturers were very hands-on, helping in every way they could to ensure you performed to the best of your ability. The constructive feedback from peers and lecturers was particularly helpful. The course content allowed me to develop new skills and encouraged me to become more confident in myself academically. “Before completing the course I enrolled in the BSc Hons Nursing degree. One of the lecturers helped me through this process and ensured all relevant information was included in my application before being sent. I passed the interview and commenced the course in . In December  I graduated with a ’ honours degree, said Aisling. Aisling worked in Altnagelvin Hospital but last year moved closer to home and got a post in Buncrana Community Hospital. She added: I am thankful for the Diploma as it enabled me to pursue a career that I love. I would highly recommend this course to anyone seeking to further their education whatever path they are planning to take.” Little sister Danielle, who completed the Access Course a year before Aisling, is now working in Australia as a nurse. Danielle said: I decided to do the course as I thought it would be the perfect stepping stone to get into the nursing degree I desired. I did not get enough points from my Leaving Certicate so this was another path available that enabled me access. “The course was very good and I would highly recommend to others looking to pursue their career in Nursing or further their education in any way. As a mature student I found the course eased you back into doing assignments and got your brain working academically again. The tutors were very helpful and really wanted you to do your best. “I got into Magee nursing the same year I finished the access course. I would totally recommend this course to others and I have already recommended it to many of my friends in the past.” The Access Course in Combined Studies at North West Regional College offers an opportunity for students normally over  years of age, who have been out of full time education for at least one year, a chance toto study. NWRC offers Access Courses in Health and Welfare, Science, and Combined Studies, which are all validated by local universities.

Seldom would you attend a Lavey game without bumping into him. He was never far from the effort needed to keep the wheels of the club turning. Every management team he was involved with, benefited from his diligent efforts. And he never walked past without speaking. Ians gone. And we are devastated, read the words on Laveys social media. In our club, Ian Hendry was peerless - as passionate Lavey man as there has ever been.

He ferociously protected all things Lavey footballs, hurls, sliotars, jerseys and above all, club pride. Two seasons ago, Lavey Us played in the final of the Paul McGirr U tournament, in the teeming rain. A game they almost wrestled back from Carrickmores clutches. In defeat, the team bounced back to win the Ulster minor tournament. On that day in Dromore, in the midst of the Us disappointment, a football went missing. Ian wasnt defeated. Not yet. When Lavey ed in for an Ulster league game with Dromore the following, he went looking again and found it. googletag.cmd.push It typied the unyielding determination of Ian Hendry who was above all a kind hearted and generous man, a loving husband, father and devoted grandfather, Laveys statement added. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ians we Agnes, daughters Orla, Mairead and Dymphna, sons Cahal and Eunan and all the wider family circle and friends. Like the story of the lost and recovered football, Ian never forgot. And Lavey will never forget Ian Hendry. Ar dheis Deacute go raibh a anam uasal.

The plan was to bring entertainment to the war weary inhabitants of the town.This meeting would lead to the formation of St Patrickrsquos Operatic and Pantomime Society and their first production was Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter mdash a title that has dated somewhat.The public responded by volunteering as actors, stage hands, working with costumes and music.Principals and chorus rehearsed separately. Only one week before opening night did they merge, coming together for the first time on the stage of St Patrickrsquos Hall.It was advertised as lsquoA Feast of Music, Song and Dancersquo boasting  voices. Rehearsal took place in the McLean home, the cast rehearsed upstairs, while machinists and costumiers worked downstairs.Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter was performed on Sunday, May , and Monday, May , .It proved successful enough to be followed in  by other productions such as Tangles, The Enchanted Rose and Quest of Olwen.The performances, in the absence of film footage and photographs, appear to be lost in the haze of time.Tangles, described as a grand musical comedy, was performed in St Patrickrsquos Hall on Monday, June , the night before the Normandy Landings. The performance was in aid of the Down County Infirmary.The programme included cast and production notes. The actors, credited as lsquoMortalsrsquo included Michael Tomelty as Lollipop, Sally King as Princess Pansy, Lillian Lundy as Dame Mouldy, Leslie Rice as Lord Humbug and Master Michael Rea as the Inn Keeperrsquos Son. lsquoImmortalsrsquo included Peggy Halloran as Titania, Maura Blaney as Nona and Mary Gilmore as lsquoCinderellarsquo.Also included was an array of guardsmen, a chorus of fairies, village chorus, court dancers, innkeeper chorus, fairy partners, bunnies and a chorus of gnomes, who included Maureen Dorrian, Annie Murphy and June Doyle. In all, the cast numbered .The scenic artist was Mr James Maguire and the costume designer was Mrs OrsquoKelly. In charge of actors make-up were Mrs Maguire, Kathleen Branf and Mrs Gilmore.But, what was the story  With appearances from gnomes and Cinderella it may have had a little to do with fairyland.Is there anyone out there who remembers  At this distance, it is just a forgotten show, one of many that enter-tained people at a most dficult time in history.Around Lecale and where, there were a number of amateur dramatic companies, many more than today, who performed many shows. Here are but a sample.Old King Cole by May King, with nine scenes and a chorus of , was a three-hour show, staged in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, at pm on Sunday, February , .Reserved tickets were on sale from Mr Breen, Mr Fox and Mr Doris.Ballykilbeg Dramatic Society gave the public a production of Paul Twyning by George Shiels on Sunday, March , and Tuesday, March , , with a repeat performance in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, the following Sunday.Kilclief Parish Amateur Dramatic Club staged Shielsrsquo new comedy, The Fort Field, in St Malachyrsquos Hall in the village on Sunday, May , . They also performed it in the Stella Maris Hall in Strangford the following Friday.Killyleagh Dramatic Society presented St John Ervinersquos lsquoBoydrsquos Shop at the Belfast Dramatic Festival during the first week of September , having staged it during the late summer of that year in Strangford.On the night of Sunday, November , , you could treat yourself to Stars over Ballynoe, an all-star iety concert in St Patrickrsquos Parochial Hall, Ballynoe, with Alister Dick, the famous Irish tenor, Alfie Donnelly, Irelandrsquos funniest comedian, the Legamaddy Dancers and the Portaferry Hawaiian Band. The compere was Joseph Caher.Woodgrange Platoon Home Guard presented The Lilac Ribbon by Downpatrick born playwright Lynn Doyle in the Woodgrange Orange Hall on Friday, January , .The Whip Hand was performed by the Stella Maris Players in the Parochial Hall, Saul, on Sunday, May , .The Bryansford Players staged The Rale True Doctor and Professor Tim in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Bryansford, on Sunday, April , , and in St Maryrsquos Hall, Newcastle, on Sunday and Monday, April  and .The Pikemen Orsquo the Ards, described as ldquothe grand Irish drama in five acts, was presented in Dunsford Hall on Sunday, April , , by the Cruachan Cowey Dramatic Club, with Irish selections by the Silver Star Band, Portaferry.With television, the internet and computer games there appears to be less interest today in local drama groups.

Hopefully, therersquos more to come, he said.Joersquos latest work is QUINN - No Place to Hide, a standalone follow-up to a successful launch of the first in the series. The title is dedicated to his great grandfather, Sam Quinn, a man Joe admired for the way in which he dealt with the harshness of le in Downpatrick at the turn of the twentieth century.ldquoHe worked -hour shts, six days a week, as a yard foreman at the Rearsquos bottling plant in Market Street, Downpatrick. It was backbreaking work for which he earned a pittance to feed a large family. He never complained, never took a holiday, and never ventured outside the confines of the town. He lived through two world wars, the creation of the Irish Republic, and countless other momentous times, yet he kept his head down and simply got on with his own le.Joe is quick to point out that the character in his latest book is nothing like his ancestor. ldquoAll Irsquove taken is his name. My version of Quinn is that of an international assassin who leaves Downpatrick to join the Irish Rangers and later becomes a gun for hire in America. Talk about two dferent worlds! Perhaps though, therersquos a bit of parallel in that I transferred old Sam Quinnrsquos stoicism and relentless nature into a make-believe cut-out who lives his le by those very ideals.With a -year background in journalism, it was hardly surprising that Joe wanted to keep writing when he switched careers in  to head up Down Business Centre, a support enterprise agency to help promote start-up businesses.He said: ldquoI loved the interaction with local entrepreneurs, but the writing bug doesnrsquot go away. I had always an idea for a book and couldnrsquot stop scratching the itch. After a few years, I decided to put it into action.That first book mdash SOMEONE HAS TO PAY mdash was a product of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It is set in the unlikely surroundings of Bishopscourt, a former RAF base just outside Downpatrick, and features a British government elite squad assembled under the relative anonymity of the old complex for the purposes of waging a final shoot-to-kill war against the IRA.Joersquos own assessment of the story brings a wry smile. ldquoItrsquos a far-fetched idea, isnrsquot it  It couldnrsquot have happened, could it  Thatrsquos the essence of the storyteller and I guess itrsquos why I love doing it.A recurring theme in Joersquos books is that he likes toin a mention of his hometown whenever possible. Yoursquoll find Downpatrick cropping up a lot in background narratives, or as the setting for a few hair-raising episodes that attempt to weave their way into the history and fabric of the area.ldquoItrsquos just something I like to do. Irsquom a Downpatrick man and I have the urge to shout about it when the chance arises. Wersquove a lot going for us in this area and it can only do good to let the world know wersquore here.One of his other books SPENT FORCE, which was a crime thriller set in the West of Ireland and featured a fading Garda detective, attracted praise from two signicant sources. One was Ken Bruen, the international bestselling author of the Jack Taylor Irish crime series, who wrote: ldquoSometimes a book comes along that you instantly know......damn, I am now going to have to read this all over again for the sheer joy of the narrative. It means that I will have to swear off other books for a time as very few can provide the utter joy and delight of Joe McCoubreyrsquos superb novel.Another unexpected source was a serving Garda sergeant who posted a glowing review on the Amazon . ldquoA top-class novel which deserves high praise. I am from Irish law enforcement and this novel is as close to a real-le investigation as you can get. Gripping from start to finish, totally believable characters, strong storyline, Highly Recommended.Joe admits he was floored by the feedback. ldquoOn the one hand there was an endorsement by perhaps Irelandrsquos foremost crime thriller author, while on the other there was vindication from a policeman that the research and effort to get things right had paid off. Itrsquos what any author craves, and itrsquos what makes you want to get back over the keyboard and start into the next adventure.That next adventure is taking Joe back to the West of Ireland to team up again with his favourite Garda detective. The sequel is provisionally titled FORCE OF NATURE which delves into the murky world of a serial killer. Not surprisingly, Downpatrick features heavily again.ldquoYes, the killerrsquos first three victims are young girls from Downpatrick. The story will move from here to Westport and back again. Irsquom still not sure how it will end, and thatrsquos as much an appeal to me as it is to the reader.Joe explains that hersquos not a dedicated story plotter. ldquoI use a broad brush. I get an idea and just run with it. I donrsquot like to be confined to structure from start to finish, with the result that Irsquom not quite sure where Irsquom going from one chapter to another. I think of it as being spontaneous, which means I usually go off on tangents that keeps things fresh and moving along.

What happened last Friday is the final straw as far as I am concerned, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe only sensible solution is to remove the hedge in its entirety. To do so would not cost a lot of money, but would save lives as at this time of year as people would not have to walk on a busy main road to pass.Cllr Walker says he has raised the issue with the telecoms company over the years, but was told the hedge could not be cut back as it was the nesting season.ldquoMy biggest fear has always been that someone could end up getting killed or seriously injured at this part of Killyleagh. While I am thankful the woman who stepped off the footpath last Friday was not seriously injured, this must be the last incident of this kind, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI am appealing to BT to do the decent thing and finally remove the hedge. We have been fortunate up until now no one has been injured, but I shudder to think what could happen at this location.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThis situation is a major accident waiting to happen, but it can be avoided by simply removing a hedge. It is s no brainer and I hope BT will agree to my request.A BT spokesperson said the organisation was sorry to learn of the distress that the hedge may have caused and would be in contact with Cllr Walker directly.ldquoThe hedge is scheduled to be trimmed back this week.

Ride hill repeats on any hill anywhere in the world mdash or on Zwt, the virtual cycling simulator mdash in a single activity until you climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest.The concept was created by Hells , who also control the induction into the Everesting Hall of Fame. Website Everesting.cc contains the rules to follow.Well, call me crazy, but I did it. No, I didnrsquot fly to Nepal and climb the actual mountain. Irsquom not a former pro athlete or extraordinarily gted human, nor am I an adventure adrenaline junkie looking for a fix. Irsquom just a  something mdash  to be precise mdash son of God who has a family, a job, a dog, a bicycle, and I landed myself in the Everesting Hall of Fame. And you can too.I decided to use the challenge to help raise funds for mental health organisations Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Service, or The Hub, as itrsquos known locally. My initial target was pound but I was astounded and humbled by the generosity of people. In the end donations totalled pound,.I chose to start at am so I could have family support at the finish. Despite the early start I was joined by my we, Jennie, and through the day she was a great support, bringing me fresh drinks and relaying messages of support.I turned on my favourite music playlist and hit the hill with a measured effort that I thought I could sustain for hours. I planned a bidon of sports drink for each ascent, as well as -g carbs per hour. Real foods early in the ride and gels and sugary drinks for later in the ride.The first three or four ascents felt strangely comfortable, averaging  minutes up each time. I was almost an hour ahead of my estimated -hour schedule by midday. I later noticed some friends,, who were tracking my progress, were saying how strong I was riding and hoped that I wouldnrsquot pay for it later.They were right! Ascents six and seven were so tough, even to the point where I felt physically ill, and my times were now over  minutes per climb.vEveresters add the tag lsquovEverestingrsquo to their Zwt profile name which means anyone on the course that sees it knows you are vEveresting and many will ride with you, congratulate you, give you a thumbs up, or just encourage you to keep going.These wonderful sherpas made it a much more enjoyable experience, especially during the sixth and seventh ascents when it was dficult to want to keep riding and my butt was telling me that I was crazy to push on.Despite wanting to reach the finish as soon as possible, I had to listen to my body, and so I stopped for some food and a bit of a rest. Another quick shower, kit change and application of chamois cream, and I was ready to continue.I was joined online this time by good friends Nathan Mullan and Stephen Hanna, both from Dromara Cycling Club, and Sam Carmichael and Nigel Bradley, from my old club, Northwest CC. Seeing them there gave me a real boost and that combined with knowing I had the end in sight really spurred me on to the finish.The final  metres of climbing were the best - I was getting messages of encouragement from Zwters from places as far away as Germany, USA and Colombia. I finished shortly after pm, over  hours after I first leapt into the saddle and boy did I sleep well that night.So to finish, Irsquod like to say a huge thanks to everyone for their support, to those who donated in such hard times mdash Irsquom so grateful and Irsquom hopeful we will make le that little bit easier for others.I havenrsquot put any thought into the next challenge mdash on Sunday I said never again mdash but the beauty of cycling is therersquos always the next time.

Thatrsquos something our whole extended family embraces.ldquoItrsquos going to be bittersweet but we are happy for Mary and the lovely couple who are adopting her. Itrsquos good to know that she will be going to her forever home and will have a lovely little le. Thatrsquos always the ultimate aim for a child, particularly a younger child.ldquoHowever, one of the challenges is trying to teach her about adoption. How do you teach a three year-old that she will be leaving us and going to a forever family  We had to be creative and came up with the idea about the Christmas elf. Like many houses, we had Bauble the elf at Christmas, who was then lsquoadoptedrsquo by Mary and now lives with us all year round and is part of our family. We even made an adoption certicate to show her it was real.ldquoWhile Covid- has put a hold on this for now, we still have to prepare both Mary and ourselves, as it will be hard to say goodbye. But, as our daughter keeps saying, itrsquos part of foster care and what is right for Mary.ldquoEveryone has been writing their goodbye letters to her. We have prepared a book about her time with us and videos so that she wonrsquot have any gaps when shersquos looking back on her le.The Dicksons have been fostering since  and have looked after eight children so far, ranging in age from one to eight. They do respite fostering ndash temporary childcare for another fosterer or family ndash and short-term foster care.Itrsquos something that the couple have wanted to do for a long time.ldquoI wanted to foster for as long as in my early twenties and my husband felt the same, said  year-old Tanya. ldquoWe both came from family backgrounds where close relatives were in the caring professions.ldquoWe were very united in knowing that we would foster one day, even from the day we were married. However, when our daughter Hannah came along, we wanted her to be part of it, obviously, and to wait until the time that we were sure she understood the impact of it.ldquoWe waited until she was about  before we contacted the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Thatrsquos where our journey started, and we havenrsquot looked back once. The Trust has been with us every step of the way. The only regret we have had about fostering is not doing it sooner.The Dicksons have also been supported by their nearest and dearest in doing something that many other people consider doing.ldquoWe were lucky that our families were always on board with us regarding our fostering, Tanya said. Our employers have been amazing, our church family and even the village family of Crossgar. Everyone has really embraced our fostering journey.After making contact with the Trust Tanya, who works at Kilmood Early Years Playgroup, said that after a period of assessment and training they began to foster six months later.ldquoI think the assessment can put people off, but I believe itrsquos an invaluable tool as you come out of it knowing yourself better, she explained. You know your own personal qualities better and your skill base.ldquoItrsquos also essential as it helps the Trust match children with dferent needs with dferent foster carers. The only thing we stipulated is that any child we cared for would be at least two years younger than Hannah as we wanted her to be the eldest child in the house.Hannah, who is a student of Saintfield High School, has been integral to the couplersquos success as foster parents and has relished her role as lsquobig sisterrsquo.Mrs Dickson said: ldquoHannah has been so great with the children. With Hannah maturing, she is showing her experience of fostering in a very positive and beautul way by showing empathy to others.ldquoThatrsquos something she would never have experienced had we not fostered and she feels more grateful for her family le. She wants to be a nurse and I can see that great caring spirit being fostered in her care of Mary. Itrsquos been so rewarding and has changed us completely for the better.Unlike many first-time parents, Tanya said foster parents always have help and support available.She said: ldquoEvery child that comes through our door is dferent and you adapt accordingly for whatever that child needs. We have the support of a link worker, who has had a lot of training. Yoursquore never on your own.ldquoWe have learnt to take things at a childrsquos pace. Some children who have been looked after before are used to being more independent and self-sufficient. You have to walk a fine line at the beginning with each child to know what they want you to do for them.The Dicksons hope to continue fostering for as long as possible and to do their best for any child that comes their way.ldquoCaring for a toddler has kept us young. You are on the ball from the crack of dawn until bedtime. I would like to think we could continue fostering for as long as we want as therersquos no age limit to fostering, she added.If you are interested in becoming a foster carer, like Tanya, or just want to find out more about what is involved, visit the HSC Northern Ireland Adoption and Foster Care website or call    to find out more.* Maryrsquos name has been changed to protect her identity..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Dean pops the question at open air gig  ","story":"A KILMORE man enlisted the help of local musician Eddie Booth when he got down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend recently.Dean Campbelland his girlfriend of ten years Laura Walters, have been big fans of Eddiersquos lsquoLive at the Lamplightrsquo gigs which he performs from his garden in Kilmore each Saturday night during the Covid- lockdown.However, unbeknown to Laura, who is a care worker for the NHS, Saturday, May , was about to become the most memorable of them all.Dean, who works for a local quarry company, says keeping the proposal a secret from Laura was the hardest thing he ever had to do.ldquoI had spoken with Laurarsquos parents, who live in England, to let them know what I was planning and arranged for them to be tuning into Eddiersquos gig via Zoom, he said.While Laura, who is also , was excited about seeing her family, she remained oblivious to the fact Eddie, was in on the delightful conspiracy.ldquoTherersquos just so much sad news around at the moment, I thought it would be a wee morale boost for the community to pop the question, so I approached Eddie to ask for his help.

Republicans are already planning a memorial on council property in Castlewellan and it is believed that loyalists in Ballynahinch may erect a memorial to dead UVF terrorists on council land at Langley Road.KILLYLEAGH ndash A new community forum, to represent the interests of a wide range of groups in the Killyleagh area, is to be set up.The umbrella organisation will represent what has been described as the ldquoimpressive level of community activity in the area.The idea to create the new group was floated at last weekrsquos annual meeting of the Killyleagh, Shrigley and District Town Committee by secretary Peter Bryson.He said the new group is vital to enable better communication and planning and help with the compilation of joint funding applications to a range of funders.He said the creation of the new group could provide the perfect  on which to develop partnerships of shared interest in the Killyleagh area.SAINTFIELD mdash As the controversy over the dangers of mobile telephone equipment continues, Saintfield residents have found themselves at the centre of the most recent debate.Parents and councillors met in the local library last week to discuss their fears of two telecommunications masts at Comber Road, which they believe are casting a shadow over the local high school.The public meeting was called by mother-of-three Laura Bill in the wake of the independent Stewart report which advises parents not to allow their children to use mobile phones, and pointed to children as being most likely to be affected by possible health risks.Leukaemia is one illness which reports have suggested could be caused, or aggravated by, radiation from mobile phone masts.One woman told Thursdayrsquos meeting that a pocket of seven children under  years of age suffer from childhood leukaemia in the Saintfield area, leading to parental fears that this could be aggravated by the existence of the masts.BALLYGOWAN mdash A shooting incident in Ballygowan during the early hours of Monday is being linked to a paramilitary feud.The house at Comber Road was sprayed with automatic gunfire by four men who smashed a number of windows.

Indeed, the safety of those working in the sector, as well as that of the wider public, will be paramount in all of this.Ms Rogan said that the reopening of tourist accommodation will depend on the

guidelines and stay safe and save lives then we can get our tourism economy open for business again.Cllr Curran said he was pleased that a major part of the tourism sector was scheduled to reopen and echoed calls for people to continue following public health advice, suggesting aldquochallenging world awaits all aspects of business in the months and years ahead.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one product and, prior to the pandemic, generated hundreds of thousands of pounds for the local economy, helping sustain thousands of jobs, he continued.ldquoClearly, the safety of staff and the public is paramount moving forward and I have every confidence that those who run our hotels, guesthouses, caravan parks and other tourist accommodation will have this at the top of their agenda.Cllr Curran said he concurred with the economy ministerrsquos contention that enabling accommodation businesses to generate essential revenue will help to protect iniduals and livelihoods which support families and communities across Northern Ireland.He said hoteliers and tourist accommodation providers will be seeking clarity of exactly what services they will be able to offer, so that they can plan for reopening with confidence.Cllr Curran recently called for the umbrella group that represents Northern Irelandrsquos  councils to have a role in helping the tourism industry recover from

of a major town centre site in Downpatrick were discussed at a key meeting yesterday.A steering group overseeing the redevelopment of the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and a Newry, Mourne and Down Council-owned car park met to discuss a new brochure which has been designed for the near two acre site.While it was suggested that the coronavirus pandemic is likely to delay the redevelopment of the huge site, traders and politicians are keen to see work starting on the eagerly-awaited economic regeneration of this historic part of the town.The local council and the Department for Communities are spearheading an ambitious regeneration project with the new brochure mdash understood to be still in draft form ndash designed to provide potential developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquospotential and secure expressions of interest.A number of Irish Street businesses have already invested in upgrading their respective shop fronts while the former police base was recently given a fresh coat of paint as part of a revitalisation scheme.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the pubic virtually.Described as a strategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential.While the imposing former police station enjoys protected status and cannot be razed to the ground, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come with an imaginative plan for the building.It has been identied as a development opportunity site in the Down Area Plan, with the area to the front included in Downpatrickrsquos conservation area.While it has been suggested that housing could form part of any redevelopment proposal, the building has been touted as a potential base for offices.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.They are keen to retain Irish Streetrsquos uniqueness where residents and traders live and work alongside each other and ensure that there is adequate parking. There have already been suggestions that an underground parking facility at the current Irish Street car park would allow retail units to be built on top.Work was recently completed on a protracted public realm scheme in Irish Street and it is hoped that the redevelopment of the former police base will complement this project, which resulted in the provision of new granite paving, street furniture and lighting.Downpatrick councillors are keen to see the redevelopment proposal increase the number of shoppers to the town to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the townrsquos economy for many years.It is also hoped to regenerate the town centrersquos night time economy with politicians eager for the Irish Street scheme to create a number of much-needed new jobs.Earlier this year, a number of Downpatrick councillors were given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear.Local council officials say they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site and had been planning to meet with them to discuss the way forward prior to the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, the local authority aims to work alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have previously expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre. However, it remains to be seenthat interest remains given the current economic climate.Downpatrick councillors say that they recognise the Irish Street regeneration project provides an opportunity to regenerate the town centre and provide a boost for existing businesses and hope that the project can be progressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Minister asked to give assurances on bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been asked to make it clear that delivering Ballynahinchrsquos multi-million pound bypass remains one of her key priorities.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former minister at the Department of Infrastructure mdash who is keen to see work starting on the poundm project.When he was at the helm of the Stormont department, Mr Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December .Since then, there has been major progress to deliver the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The bypass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with major new roundabouts proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Mr Hazzard said while the coronavirus pandemic has consumed much time for all government departments, he does want to diminish Ms Mallonrsquos role in working constructively with her executive colleagues in mitigating the worst effects of the global emergency.But he said since that taking over the reins at the roads department five months ago, the minister has issued statements on electric bikes and hydrogen buses and what he described as ldquoplenty of positive soundings on other capital projects, but there hasnrsquot been a single word on the long overdue Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready. Yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead since taking office in January, said Mr Hazzard.ldquoIt is unsurprising then that local businesses and commuters are beginning to question the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to deliver this scheme.The MP says he has once again asked Ms Mallon to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department and set out a timeline for commencing construction.He added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the successful delivery of this project will be a vital step in improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our local community in these dficult times.In a letter to Ms Mallon, the South Down MP said the bypass scheme is at an advanced stage and is as close to ldquoshovel ready as any other project in the government departmentrsquorsquos capital programme.He has asked the ministerthe Ballynahinch scheme remains a ldquopriority capital project, what stage is it currently at and when will construction work be signed off Responding to Mr Hazzard, a spokesman for the roads minister said that while she is currently faced with ldquoserious and challenging budget constraints, she has already stated that she is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for communities and improve lives across the North.ldquoShe very much recognises that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch, the spokesman continued.ldquoIn finalising budget decisions, the minister is focused on addressing the need to fund essential infrastructure work, promoting a green recovery and getting other strategic projects underway.The spokesman said that in particular, Ms Mallon is considering her long term priorities for strategic road improvement schemes and how they might facilitate complementary improvements to promote sustainable travel choices, connecting people and communities, creating thriving and liveable places that enhance opportunities and our economy.The spokesman added: ldquoThe minister understands the frustration among the people of South Down at the failure of previous administrations to deliver important projects.ldquoShe has already set out her ambition to address regional imbalance with the delivery of projects and hopes elected representatives from across all parties and across the Executive will support her in securing the money to deliver strategic projects which improve both our economy and the wellbeing of our local communities in South Down and across the North in these dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"National Trust sites reopen  ","story":"A NUMBER of local National Trust properties reopen from today.The National Trust has confirmed that Saintfieldrsquos stunning Rowallane Garden and Castle Ward and Mount Stewart mdash both on the shores of Strangford Lough mdash will be welcoming visitors after being closed for a number of weeks as part of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.In total,  properties are reopening across the province, with Trust officials confirming that advance bookings will be required in order to limit numbers and maintain public safety.

That name, of a fine police force that was respected in policing circles internationally by the time it was disbanded, had to be ditched, to placate nationalists. Then the injustice of - recruitment was introduced, in which less qualied and less suited candidates from Catholic backgrounds for officer positions in the force were preferred for admission over better candidates from Protestant and other backgrounds . This persisted until Catholic levels of recruitment reached a certain level. Yet this is not now enough for nationalism. As the Catholic percentage of recruits slides, there is a fresh clamour to introduce positive discrimination, aslower Catholic levels are always the fault of everyone . \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...But not only that, now there is push to re-brand the PSNI to downplay the Northern Ireland element. Remember that this comes at a time in which republicans have been getting civil servants to use the phrase north of Ireland in documents.Such terminology de-legitimises the fact of Northern Ireland, which exists under the principle of consent in the  Belfast Agreement — yet those who roll their eyes and insist that terminology does not matter typically depict themselves as defenders of that deal.The PSNI insist that they are not trying sideline the Northern Ireland part of their name. So why are they doing it The chief constable Simon Byrne’s answer is not impressive. He says that the new logo, which bafflingly makes the Cross of St Patrick colourless and thus immediately un-recognisable, and which gets rid of the word Northern Ireland on the lower part of the crest, will “better reflect the breadth and depth of what we do and to improve our connection to our communities”.There is no need for this change. In fact we need a better explanation from the PSNI how such a plan has got far.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They decided they would do a Zoom competition instead and we thought it would be great to enter some of our teams in a way to keep spirits high, keep training, keep motivated and most importantly - have some fun.“We have been doing weekly Zoom rehearsals every Tuesday with the mini, junior and intermediate competition teams, which has been amazing. I have been brought to tears on many occasions by seeing their beautul, smiling faces that I miss so much.“As the restrictions started to relax - where you could meet six people outdoors - some of the dancers have started to meet up outside for their Tuesday Zoom classes, which has been really special for them. I still haven’t seen any of them in person yet but am very excited to.”Victoria revealed that a productive collaboration with Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council and the Riverside Theatre was key to making the event happen.The Ulster Dance Championships Zoom competition will feature Victoria Lagan dancers on Friday“I spoke to a member of the Council during a weekly FaceTime meeting I have with them regarding re-opening the studio and discussed the idea of us being able to do our Zoom competition together outdoors and they went through some of the legalities around it,” she said.“Once I realised this could be an option I contacted Roseanne Sturgeon, Manager of the Riverside Theatre, who was over the moon with the idea. She then had Megan Sheeran, who is the Technical Coordinator at the Riverside, to contact me to go through possibilities.“Megan has been such a huge help with this and has really gone above and beyond the call of duty in helping me do all the risk assessments so we could put it forward to be approved by Ulster University, Coleraine.“Thank goodness the Uni said yes! So we will be meeting on Friday outside at the back of Riverside - weather permitting - to compete in the Ulster Dance Championships via Zoom.”Victoria Lagan dancers will perform live on Zoom on FridayDancers and parents will have to adhere to a number of strict regulations to make sure the event passes off safely.Each dancer must use personal hand santisers, bring their own labelled water bottle, practice social distancing and have no physical contact at any time with other competitors or equipment.There will be security on site to check names of the children participating and only one parent per child will be allowed to spectate.First aid and fire marsahals will also be present and there will also be a special isolation room in the theatre should anyone develop symptoms.Markings on the grass outside the theatre will assist social distancing and no toilets will be in operation.Victoria added that anyone ignoring the safety measures will be asked to leave the site immediately.“It’s a lot of rules and regulations but we are eager to follow them and make this work so that we can give these kids a great day,” she added.“Our dancers are known for being well disciplined and I have the utmost faith that they will follow all regulations. Dancing means the world to these girls and I know how grateful they are to everyone at Riverside for allowing them to perform.“It’s going to be an amazing day!

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id
