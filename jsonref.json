[{"url":null,"title":"CHRISTOPHER STEVENS reviews years GBBO final","story":"    Rahul Mandal holds up the trophy alongside judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith after winning the Great British Bake Off          Rahul\u0027s final showstopper this series was an edible rock garden made from nearly 200 elements, the bake which won him the competition          The final was not without its controversies, however, as the eventual winner had to be given 15 minutes extra time after a storage jar shattered on his worktop. Pictured: Presenter Sandi Toksvig consoling him after the incidentWhether viewers will recall the name of last night’s victor a year from now is anyone’s guess. But one thing is certain: if it takes a nervous disposition, a slightly nutty character and a disarming lack of self-confidence to make a Bake Off hero, then Rahul Mandal, who emerged blinking and victorious at the end of this series, fits the bill perfectly.So did his closest rival, super-shy Kim-Joy Hewlett. The third finalist, Ruby Bhogal, revealed she had to bolster her self-belief by scribbling inspirational quotes on Post-It notes and plastering them over her fridge.With so much attention focused on the finalists, all of Asian heritage, judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith were almost by-standers. Sandi Toksvig and her co-presenter Noel Fielding had more to do, mostly comforting the contestants and talking them out of their panics. But it’s a shame that in 2018 some television personalities still feel they have to flash their cleavage to get themselves noticed.Noel spent the whole weekend with his psychedelic shirt open to the solar plexus, displaying skin as white as an albino rat with a tuft of limp chest hair.It wasn’t an appetising sight. He looked like a tubby Dracula, in need of a spray tan and a waxing.          Rahul, pictured with his mother as a baby in Kolkata, India, only took up baking two years ago having never made a cake before          Close-ups of the smashed storage jar show it had shattered all over Rahul\u0027s bench, making it impossible for him to finish the challengeTry as he might to distract the cameras, all the attention was on the search for the Most Overwrought Baker. King of the Nervous Nellies was Rahul, who appears to be a frightened 11-year-old boy trapped in the body of an undersized man aged 30. During the technical challenge, when the finalists were sent outside to bake pitta breads on open fires, Rahul flung his arm up in the air like a schoolboy desperate to be excused games. ‘I need help, am I doing it right?’ he pleaded.A nd after presenter Sandi gently explained that she wasn’t able to give advice, he muttered sadly, ‘I’d better just not come tomorrow. Just utter disgrace.’Rahul began each morning with a glass of milk. I suspect this is because his mother told him to do this when he was four, and he is still an obedient boy.But all that calcium doesn’t seem to have stiffened his spine: ‘I am very, very, very nervous,’ he admitted at the start of the final signature bake, featuring decorated doughnuts.Not that he’d ever been brave enough to actually try tasting one. ‘It looks like deep-fried bread,’ he fretted. ‘I’m not going to eat it.’ Quite right – harm could come to a young fellow.

And whilst all series we\u0026#39ve been obsessing over hosts Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig in their statement shirts, this time it was contestant Kim-Joy who stood out from the crowd! Her ice lolly print shirt couldn\u0026#39t have been more appropriate for a hot day in the tent, and we love the cutesy design and combination of colours.

But we all know that glass doesn’t simply explode on warm summer days, or tropical countries wouldn’t be able to have windows in their houses.That jar disintegrated because Rahul’s terror had set off a vibration of physical intensity.‘This is a sign from God that I need to stop baking,’ he wailed as he swept up the fragments.Kim-Joy tried to match his levels of eccentricity, by building a ruined temple in Atlantis out of gingerbread, and Ruby popped a unicorn on her profiteroles, but there was only ever going to be one winner.‘Oh no-no-no-no-no,’ he mumbled. But oh yes, Rahul – you’re this year’s Star Baker. Better get used to it.          Rahul took time out from celebrating to call his relatives in India who sounded over the moon at news of his historic victory          Kim-Joy Hewlett created a stunning ruined temple in Atlantis out of gingerbread in her attempt to claim the Bake Off crown          Flour power: Rahul\u0027s donuts are almost ready to eat as he removes them from the fryer during the  finale on Tuesday night          Talented: Receiving many Hollywood handshakes during the series, research scientist Rahul, 30, secured first place during Break and Cake Week"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/31/02/51D07DD900000578-6335433-image-a-27_1540951285390.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles reaction spots Instagrammer used follow New Zealand","story":"Take on the trench coat like Meghan wearing BurberryShop the current collection at NET-A-PORTERThe Duchess of Sussex has already proven her versatility when it comes fashion during the royal tour.

Although based on a true story, Steven Spielberg’s multi-Oscar-winning film was fiction. This was a tale of true, unvarnished tragedy – one which now goes to the heart of the modern Royal Family.The duchess had never seen photographs of her three great great uncles – Francis, Maurice and Lionel Lupton – until yesterday afternoon. She was particularly struck by the family resemblance in young Maurice. The boys’ mother Harriet had died in 1892.          Some of the mementos which were shown to Kate included a photo of a man called Maurice The tragedy that haunts Kate\u0027s family: How three young...Why was Kate Middleton not wearing a sash at the state...Share this articleThe letters from the men were placed next to their photographs, which have been stored at the museum           Just days ahead of the century of the Armistice the duchess attended the Imperial War Museum on WednesdayNor had she seen family heirlooms like the standard issue postcard from Lionel on July 16, 1916, telling his family: ‘I am quite well.’ Just hours later, he was killed by enemy shell fire.‘It’s all so sad,’ said the duchess, her words tailing off.Here, too, was the telegram from a certain Richard Noel Middleton, married to the brothers’ elder sister, Olive. He was serving on the same part of the Western Front as the eldest Lupton, Francis, when his brother-in-law went missing in 1917. Richard went out searching for him and, in all the mayhem, actually found his body.  The duchess was shown various letters such as this one (left) which started \u0027Dear Father\u0027, she seemed to enjoy rifling through the postcards and letters           One of the letters shown to the duchess had a postal stamp marked Chapel Town, Leeds (right hand corner)          This telegram was also shown to the duchess. The telegram said there was \u0027bad news\u0027 and that \u0027Francis body\u0027 had been found \u0027near Taylors\u0027He then had the grim task of confirming the news in a telegram to the family in February 1917: ‘Bad news. Francis body found. Killed instantaneously bomb.’The stark brevity of it stunned the duchess. ‘Hardly any words. It’s so bland,’ she sighed. ‘How sad.’Richard and Olive, who were married in 1914, later produced a son, Peter Middleton, who went on to serve as a fighter pilot in the Second World War. His son, Michael Middleton, is the duchess’s father.          The the duchess explored the museum and seemed intrigued at the letters and photos which were presented before herThe news of Francis’s death, confirmed in that telegram from Richard Middleton, was followed by a special letter on black-bordered paper with a very familiar letterhead.‘You might recognise the address, Ma’am,’ observed the IWM’s director, Diane Lees, lightening the mood.The duchess nodded. Here was a letter from Buckingham Palace, signed by the Keeper of the Privy Purse, to Francis Lupton Senior in April 1917. ‘The King realises that this is the third beloved son you have given in your Country’s cause,’ reads the typewritten letter. ‘His Majesty trusts that you may be granted strength and comfort in the further sorrow which you have been called upon to bear.’    Whilst at the museum Diane Lees (right) the director explained the poppy sculpture \u0027Weeping Window\u0027 as she arrived at the museum ‘I’m sure so many families had these letters and sad stories,’ the duchess reflected. In fact, as the IWM’s head of documents, Anthony Richards, pointed out later, the poor Luptons were actually extremely unfortunate. ‘To lose all three sons was fairly unusual,’ he explained.It may be more than 100 years since the brothers were killed yet there remains a timeless poignancy to this message of commiseration from George V to a bereft father in Yorkshire who would turn out to be the great great great grandparent of the future George VII.The family had been granted the flimsy consolation of knowing that the bodies of all three of their sons were found, identified and buried in marked graves – unlike the hundreds of thousands merely engraved on memorials to the missing. All three graves are lovingly tended to this day by the gardeners of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.    Kate looked fresh faced as she marvelled at the poppy sculpture situated on the outside of the museum Despite the sombre nature of the visit, the duchess and her hosts were keen to touch on some of the lighter moments contained in the letters. In one of them, Maurice wrote about a soldier adopting a magpie as a pet. In another, he wrote home requesting a consignment of vegetable seeds.‘A very Middleton thing,’ the duchess noted brightly. ‘My grandmother loved gardening. I’ve got a lot to live up to.’ Results have been mixed in the Kensington Palace vegetable patch, by all accounts. ‘You shouldn’t see my cauliflowers,’ the duchess added.She also read a letter from Maurice to his father, making light of life in the trenches – even though his trench occupied such a boggy bit of ground that ‘there is generally only about 18” actually dug and the rest is built up with sandbags or sods, to make a little place you can crawl into for protection from a shell or bullet’.      Francis Lupton (left) was killed in 1917, Lieut Lionel Lupton in 1916 and Captain Maurice Lupton in 1915Major Francis Lupton  (left)The eldest brother, he served with the 8th Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment and was killed by a bomb on February 19, 1917, aged 31.He had been married for less than three years and had a young daughter, Ruth. By the time he went to France in January 1917 with the Leeds Rifles to serve with the all-territorial 62nd (2nd West Riding) Infantry Division, his two brothers had already been killed.He was posted as missing after only six weeks. It was thought he might have been taken prisoner, but two months later his body was found. It was thought he was blown up on patrol.Captain Maurice Lupton  (right)The family’s first casualty of the war, Maurice was killed by a sniper on June 19, 1915, aged 28 – only two months after going to the front line.He joined the Leeds Rifles, became a captain in the 7th battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, the Prince of Wales’ regiment, and was shipped to the support trenches in Belgium as part of the all-territorial 49th (1st West Riding) Infantry Division.He arrived on April 19, 1915. He was one of 2,050 members of the Leeds Rifles to be killed on active service in France and Flanders during the war.Lieut Lionel Lupton  (centre)The youngest of the brothers to lose their lives, he was killed by a German shell at the Battle of the Somme aged only 24 on July 16, 1916.He served with 28th Brigade Royal Field Artillery and had spent a significant amount of time in the front line trenches in France, surviving the Battle of Loos in 1915.He was then wounded on December 1, sent to a hospital in London to recuperate and travelled home for Christmas, where his family was mourning the death of his brother Maurice, before returning to the Western Front.

Cabin crew are also refusing to hand over duty-free alcohol purchased on board to drunk passengers.In a separate move, the Department of Transport is considering plans to force retailers to put duty-free alcohol in sealed plastic bags.  Currently licensing laws that prevent the sale of alcohol outside permitted hours do not apply to \u0027airside\u0027 sales – once passengers have gone through security.Airlines have for years described this as a \u0027legal loophole\u0027 which enables retailers to sell alcohol irresponsibly at any time of the day or night.Unlike high street pubs and restaurants, they do not have the threat of being stripped of their licence if they behave irresponsibly – such as selling alcohol to drunk passengers.Some airside bars have encouraged binge drinking by selling \u0027two-pint measures\u0027 – even though it is a criminal offence to be drunk on a plane.           The changes mooted by the Home Office would see pubs, restaurants and duty free shops delay serving alchohol until 10am- ending the early morning pre-flight tradition of a pintLast year pub fi Wetherspoon, which has locations at airports across the country, said it \u0027did not believe extra regulation was needed\u0027 at airports and said staff \u0027understand their responsibility\u0027 not to serve drunk passengers.There are already tough penalties for drunkenness on an aircraft – a maximum of two years in prison or an unlimited fine.But airline Ryanair has previously called for more restrictions on alcohol sales at airports.It proposed a two-drink limit for passengers and a total ban on alcohol sales in airports before 10am.It said in a statement: ‘It is incumbent on the airports to introduce these preventative measures to curb excessive drinking and the problems it creates, rather than allowing passengers to drink to excess before their flights.‘It’s completely unfair that airports can profit from the unlimited sale of alcohol to passengers and leave the airlines to deal with the safety consequences.’In a separate move earlier this year the Department of Transport said it is considering plans to force retailers to put duty free alcohol – such as miniature bottles of spirits – in sealed plastic bags.This proposal follows concerns about passengers stocking up on duty free and binge drinking before they get on a flight.Last year a House of Lords Committee recommended airport bars and restaurants have similar trading hours rules under the Licencing Act 2003 after a spike in \u0027air rage\u0027.The Lords committee report said: \u0027No one travelling on an international flight can fail to notice that, once they have gone through customs, control of the sale of alcohol seems to be relaxed, and the permitted hours even more so.\u0027This is because the Licensing Act 2003 is expressly disapplied from such areas.\u0027The incidents occurring on flights are notorious, sometimes requiring flights to be erted, and more often than not such incidents are the consequence of alcohol consumed airside before the flight.The report added: \u0027Many also had the opportunity to drink heavily at the airport before they get on the flight.\u0027The Civil Aviation Authority report a 36 per cent increase in disruptive passenger incidents in the UK between 2014 and 2015. This is a large number of incidents for a relatively small airline.\u0027Alcohol Concern told us of a survey of holidaymakers which found that nearly 1 in 5 passengers said they began their holiday drinking at the airport.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Secret plan make Charles Prince Regent three years","story":"    The Queen (left) knows that even she cannot go on for ever.

Governors general, ambassadors and prime ministers will learn first. But in the world of 24-hour news it will not stay secret for long.Prince William clashed with Charles over whether Buckingham...Share this articleAll this, however, is jumping the gun. Given the Queen’s history of robust health, perhaps a far more likely scenario is that her great age will mean she herself will trigger a period of regency, thus ensuring safe stewardship of the great office she has held and worked so hard to secure.Senior former members of her household believe the Queen will grant her eldest son the full power to reign while she still lives because of the respect she holds for the institution of monarchy.Abdication, however, is not even a consideration. One senior aide admitted to me the ‘dusting off’ of the Regency Act. My understanding is that senior figures, with the Queen’s blessing, have been examining various scenarios.      Practical and unsentimental about her advancing years, the Queen, who is known around Whitehall as Reader No 1, has had Charles added to the distribution list of despatch boxes that she is sent. In the event of her death or inability to continue through illness, the Queen has ensured that her heir is fully primed and ready to take over.Some close to the monarch say that, if she reaches the age of 95, she will make a monumental decision and choose to officially allow Charles to take over the stewardship of her reign.She will, they say, officially transfer all executive powers to him as Prince Regent until her death, when he will become king. This would enable her to fudge the issue of her not fulfilling her Coronation Oath to God and her people to serve as queen regnant until her death.          Prince Charles (pictured) is effectively already our \u0027Prince Regent\u0027, a king in all but name Others, who claim to be equally well informed, say that such a move or use of the ‘Regent’ title is not really necessary. After all, as the Queen made clear to the unassuming 103rd Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, when he went to see her on the occasion of his resignation in her Golden Jubilee year of 2002: ‘That’s something I can’t do.’Times, however, do change. In truth, with the Queen now well into her tenth decade, senior officials within the Royal Household confirm that Prince Charles is effectively already our ‘Prince Regent’, a king in all but name.Granted, Her Majesty is a consecrated monarch who pledged in her coronation oath to serve throughout her life. But can she seriously remain as head of state if she lives to be a centenarian like her mother?The last time the Regency Act was invoked was in 1810 during the reign of George III, when the monarch became permanently deranged. It meant his eldest son assumed the title Prince Regent for ten years until, on his father’s death, he became George IV.Queen Elizabeth II has enjoyed remarkably good health, both mental and physical, and there is nothing to suggest that Regency would be necessary in the way that it was for George III.Behind palace gates, however, preparations have been made in recent months for all eventualities, with Her Majesty’s blessing.Strangely, until 1937, our constitutional law had no permanent provision for a regent to cover the situation of a monarch being incapable of performing his or her duties.It was the debilitating illness of the Queen’s grandfather, George V — who suffered from chronic bronchitis from 1935 until his death — that led to the reformed Regency Act including the intriguing possibility of a Regency if ‘the Sovereign is for some definite cause not available for the performance of those functions’. It is not clear what situations this covers.Perhaps it is vague enough to allow the monarch simply to pass the baton to her heir and effectively retire — thus effecting the smoothest of successions with the minimum of fuss.The Queen is au courant with the passage of time, and how her age impacts on the institution she serves. She has, impeccable sources have told me, already drawn a line in the sand, a date when, like Prince Philip, she will effectively retire from public life.          The Queen doesn\u0027t seem to be slowing down on her royal engagements. Earlier this month she met with Queen MaximaNobody has a crystal ball. But my knowledge of the monarchal system leads me to believe that, whatever happens, it will unfold naturally. It is clear, however, that Charles’s position as the driving force of the institution in the second decade of the 21st century, as he approaches his 70th birthday, is indisputable. He, not the Queen, is the firm hand on the tiller.In the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana, many long-serving staff at Buckingham Palace believed the public would never tolerate Charles becoming king.Since then, however, anger against Charles has subsided.Through hard work and consistency, and perhaps the popularity of his sons and their wives — and the goodwill they have generated — such fears have all but disappeared.He may still be blamed for Diana’s misery over his infidelity with Camilla Parker Bowles, but there’s no longer a groundswell of support for skipping a generation.It was the Queen herself who eventually urged him to resolve the ‘Camilla problem’ by marrying his lover. Mindful of his duty, Charles complied.This was a smoothing of the way forward to the next generation, not simply the glorious resolution of Charles and Camilla’s enduring grand romance.It was made clear to Charles that he had to fit in with the bigger picture and accept the shifting shape of the monarchy as envisaged by the Queen. It was a calculated risk and it appears to have paid off. The warm receptions given to Charles and Camilla when on tour, and the more positive Press coverage of Camilla, is increasingly gentle but never effusive.More recently, on her 90th birthday, the Queen took the key decision to elevate Camilla to her most senior advisory body, the Privy Council. As ever, this was all done very quietly. And, as ever, the Queen had her reasons.          Camilla is set to be Queen. Queen Elizabeth had urged Charles to marry herShe wanted her daughter-in-law to be at Charles’s side at the precise moment that he formally becomes King.This will now happen: as a privy councillor, Camilla can now attend the ceremony, normally held within 24 hours of a sovereign’s death.This leads to a more contentious question: will Camilla become Queen? Ever since the Prince of Wales married the Duchess of Cornwall in April 2005, the Royal Family have gone to great lengths to avoid any public uprising over the prospect of ‘Queen Camilla’.Indeed, the official wedding announcement stated: ‘It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH the Princess Consort when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne.’The critical word in this statement, of course, was ‘intended’. What Clarence House was doing was buying time — time for a hostile public to warm to Camilla.Prince Charles, however, has always intended her to become his queen consort.According to an inside source, he’d already decided that before their wedding.‘There was no doubt in his mind at the time about that, and I honestly don’t think anything has changed,’ said the source.‘In fact, I think he has hardened his resolve.‘For there to be any other outcome would, in his view, be to lessen his role as king.‘His marriage to Camilla is legal. She happens to be his second wife. That is it. Did any of Henry VIII’s wives not get the title?’Although Camilla has worked hard and proved a great support to her husband over the years, there is no escaping the lingering feeling that Charles’s greatest asset is also his greatest weakness.Camilla, as consort and Duchess of Cornwall, is a constant reminder of his personal failings of the past. However, more than a decade of marriage, and the fact that his second wife undoubtedly gives strength from their mutual and obvious love, should be taken only as a positive.But no matter how optimistic the palace try to be, the reality is that Charles and Camilla have both brought far too much baggage to the relationship, particularly that they committed adultery — which at the very least contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to Diana — for it to be presented as anything approaching love’s young dream.I am told that Camilla will be named ‘Queen Consort’ on Charles’s ascension.There would have to be a change in the law in Britain and several other realms before Charles becomes king for her not to be. There is little or no appetite for that.To alter her status would be a PR own goal, like insisting a president’s wife should not be allowed the role and title of ‘First Lady’ — especially when the Government plans to use the royals to bolster our status on the world stage.The Duchess, 71 at the time of writing, is said to have told friends previously that she would be ‘happy’ to use the lesser title when her husband ascends to the throne.The title issue will be decided in the court of public opinion and by the Prime Minister at the time.Clarence House has always claimed that the constitutional issue surrounding the title would be ‘a matter for the government of the day’.However, all previous wives of British kings have been known as queens.Camilla has assuaged Charles’s loneliness, but knows when to leave him alone.When on the public stage, their togetherness makes them a redoubtable couple.He is the most prepared heir to the throne the country has ever had — wise, funny, intelligent and connected to his people in so many ways.She rarely puts a foot wrong on tour while representing the Queen or when supporting her husband. The Queen acknowledged this in 2012 when she awarded her daughter-in-law her highest personal honour, Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, to mark the seventh anniversary of her wedding to Prince Charles.Camilla has earned her stripes through the love and loyalty she has shown to her husband and by devotion to duty to the Crown.She will, I am told, be deservedly given the correct rank when the time comes. Charles will rightly insist on it. ADAPTED from Charles At Seventy: Thoughts, Hopes And Dreams by Robert Jobson, published by John Blake on November 1 at £20. © Robert Jobson 2018.To order a copy for £16 (offer valid until November 4, 2018 P\u0026ampP free), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640.How he will be defender of the faith   Queen Elizabeth II, as we all know, is a devout High Church Anglican. Charles, on the other hand, has taken a great interest in other religions, studying both the Koran and Judaism in depth.In 1993, for instance, he said: ‘Islam can teach us today a way of understanding and living in the world which Christianity itself is poorer for having lost.’This was widely quoted as proof that he had abandoned Christianity, though he remains a practising Anglican. Clearly, however, our next Supreme Governor of the Church of England plans to do the job a little differently.‘He is an inidual who wants to chart new territory, and that will be very interesting indeed,’ says Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury. ‘He is very outspoken.’The Prince certainly caused a furore when he told Jonathan Dimbleby that he wants to be seen as a ‘Defender of Faith’ when he ascends the throne, rather than ‘Defender of the Faith’.Since then, Charles’s position on the wording to be used at his coronation has categorically changed. It has been made clear to me that Charles will ‘absolutely 100 per cent’ be named as ‘Defender of the Faith’ when he is crowned king.But he will also demonstrate in his reign that he believes wholeheartedly in the importance of his connecting with all faiths of the subjects he will reign over.  "},{"url":null,"title":"MPs approve Mays Brexit deal terrified David Davis admits","story":"    Former Brexit secretary David Davis (pictured at Tory conference earlier this month) said \u0027irrational fear\u0027 would win out in Parliament if the PM manages to get any kind of agreement with Brussels          Theresa May (pictured in Norway yesterday) has been struggling to thrash out a orce deal with the EU          Mr Davis tried to backpedal on his remarks today - insisting a deal would not pass if it was based on ChequersNo-deal Brexit would tip Britain into a long and damaging...Share this article    Almost as many applications for Irish passports were received in the first half of 2018 as in the whole year before the referendumDemand for Irish passports has surged amid mounting fears over the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, it emerged today.Almost as many applications were received in the first half of 2018 as in the whole year before the referendum.According to figures released to the Brexit committee in the Irish senate, almost 45,000 passport applications were lodged with the Republic\u0027s UK embassy in the first half of 2018.Fine Gael\u0027s Neale Richmond suggested that the \u0027looming disaster of Brexit\u0027 was prompting eligible Britons to reconnect with their Irish heritage.He said: \u0027Since the people of the UK voted, narrowly, to leave the EU in 2016, we have seen a continuing rise in the number of applications for Irish passports in the UK.\u0027Current rules entitle those born to Irish parents or grandparents to apply for an Irish passport through a claim to citizenship.\u0027At least 10 per cent of the UK\u0027s population, not including Northern Ireland, are estimated to qualify for an Irish passport and in light of Brexit, many including a number of my own family members are staking their claim to an Irish passport.

The letter was written on October 24, but has just been published by the committee.Downing Street also tried to pour cold water on speculation about dramatic movement in the talks.    Theresa May (pictured in the House of Commons today) has been struggling to thrash out a orce deal with the EU          Aides have tried to play down speculation about a breakthrough, and the letter was dated October 24Mrs May’s official spokesman said: ‘We want to get a deal as soon as possible.’He would not confirm whether Mrs May had presented her promised new proposals on the Irish backstop, but added the PM had told MPs the EU was ‘engaging’ with Britain’s ideas. Ministers are engaged in a desperate scramble to reach a settlement with the EU, as the clock ticks down to Brexit day.If there is no movement next month the government needs to trigger large-scale contingency plans to try to reduce the impact of a no-deal outcome. In a glimmer of light for Theresa May, David Davis has admitted that he expectsMPs to approve any Brexit deal she does secure because they are \u0027terrified\u0027 of crashing out of the EU.      Almost as many applications for Irish passports were received in the first half of 2018 as in the whole year before the referendumDemand for Irish passports has surged amid mounting fears over the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, it emerged today.Almost as many applications were received in the first half of 2018 as in the whole year before the referendum.According to figures released to the Brexit committee in the Irish senate, almost 45,000 passport applications were lodged with the Republic\u0027s UK embassy in the first half of 2018.Fine Gael\u0027s Neale Richmond suggested that the \u0027looming disaster of Brexit\u0027 was prompting eligible Britons to reconnect with their Irish heritage.He said: \u0027Since the people of the UK voted, narrowly, to leave the EU in 2016, we have seen a continuing rise in the number of applications for Irish passports in the UK.\u0027Current rules entitle those born to Irish parents or grandparents to apply for an Irish passport through a claim to citizenship.\u0027At least 10 per cent of the UK\u0027s population, not including Northern Ireland, are estimated to qualify for an Irish passport and in light of Brexit, many including a number of my own family members are staking their claim to an Irish passport.                                                    The former Brexit secretary said \u0027irrational fear\u0027 would win out in Parliament if the PM manages to get any kind of agreement with Brussels.Mr Davis tried to backpedal today by insisting no package based on Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan would get passed.But the comments, from a vehement critic of Mrs May\u0027s stance, will encourage Downing Street. Negotiating teams are working in Brussels as the clocks tick down and concerns mount about the consequences of Britain crashing out of the bloc. If there is a settlement, No10 is planning to force a crunch vote in the Commons within weeks - and effectively dare MPs to risk a no-deal outcome.But the outcome could be on a knife edge, as Labour has vowed that it will not back any proposals that do not pass its six tests.The Opposition could form an alliance with Tory Brexiteers who have promised to try to kill off the PM\u0027s Chequers blueprint for future trade with the EU. Mr Davis, along with Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg , are among the senior Conservatives leading the push for the UK to seek a looser Canada-style pact with Brussels.But speaking at a discussion event in Westminister last night, Mr Davis conceded that he thought Downing Street would eventually be able to force its will through Parliament.\u0027Terror will win, the fear of no deal,\u0027 he said. \u0027I think the irrational fear of no deal, a WTO deal – that will win and there will be a deal. \u0027It may take two passes – it may be a deal that\u0027s agreed in Brussels and fails in Westminster and comes back again, it may take two passes.\u0027       "},{"url":null,"title":"Startling moment cunning leopard pounces tree takes impala","story":"    This sneaky leopard hid silently in a tree before jumping on its unsuspecting prey from aboveWould YOU be able to spot a snow leopard about to pounce on...The cat who climbed a MOUNTAIN: Adventurer finds a ginger...Share this article    After leaping from the tree it quickly took the down impala grazing happily underneathThe leopard is then seen suffocating the antelope by latching its jaws over the animal\u0027s mouth.Phil Hankinson filmed the spectacle during a game drive in Ruaha National Park, Tanzania.He said: \u0027He was incredibly difficult to see but we had a few pairs of binoculars which helped tremendously.\u0027I\u0027m still in awe really of the spectacle which unfolded.

Although based on a true story, Steven Spielberg’s multi-Oscar-winning film was fiction. This was a tale of true, unvarnished tragedy – one which now goes to the heart of the modern Royal Family.The duchess had never seen photographs of her three great great uncles – Francis, Maurice and Lionel Lupton – until yesterday afternoon. She was particularly struck by the family resemblance in young Maurice. The boys’ mother Harriet had died in 1892.          Some of the mementos which were shown to Kate included a photo of a man called Maurice The tragedy that haunts Kate\u0027s family: How three young...Why was Kate Middleton not wearing a sash at the state...Share this articleThe letters from the men were placed next to their photographs, which have been stored at the museum           Just days ahead of the century of the Armistice the duchess attended the Imperial War Museum on WednesdayNor had she seen family heirlooms like the standard issue postcard from Lionel on July 16, 1916, telling his family: ‘I am quite well.’ Just hours later, he was killed by enemy shell fire.‘It’s all so sad,’ said the duchess, her words tailing off.Here, too, was the telegram from a certain Richard Noel Middleton, married to the brothers’ elder sister, Olive. He was serving on the same part of the Western Front as the eldest Lupton, Francis, when his brother-in-law went missing in 1917. Richard went out searching for him and, in all the mayhem, actually found his body.  The duchess was shown various letters such as this one (left) which started \u0027Dear Father\u0027, she seemed to enjoy rifling through the postcards and letters           One of the letters shown to the duchess had a postal stamp marked Chapel Town, Leeds (right hand corner)          This telegram was also shown to the duchess. The telegram said there was \u0027bad news\u0027 and that \u0027Francis body\u0027 had been found \u0027near Taylors\u0027He then had the grim task of confirming the news in a telegram to the family in February 1917: ‘Bad news. Francis body found. Killed instantaneously bomb.’The stark brevity of it stunned the duchess. ‘Hardly any words. It’s so bland,’ she sighed. ‘How sad.’Richard and Olive, who were married in 1914, later produced a son, Peter Middleton, who went on to serve as a fighter pilot in the Second World War. His son, Michael Middleton, is the duchess’s father.          The the duchess explored the museum and seemed intrigued at the letters and photos which were presented before herThe news of Francis’s death, confirmed in that telegram from Richard Middleton, was followed by a special letter on black-bordered paper with a very familiar letterhead.‘You might recognise the address, Ma’am,’ observed the IWM’s director, Diane Lees, lightening the mood.The duchess nodded. Here was a letter from Buckingham Palace, signed by the Keeper of the Privy Purse, to Francis Lupton Senior in April 1917. ‘The King realises that this is the third beloved son you have given in your Country’s cause,’ reads the typewritten letter. ‘His Majesty trusts that you may be granted strength and comfort in the further sorrow which you have been called upon to bear.’    Whilst at the museum Diane Lees (right) the director explained the poppy sculpture \u0027Weeping Window\u0027 as she arrived at the museum ‘I’m sure so many families had these letters and sad stories,’ the duchess reflected. In fact, as the IWM’s head of documents, Anthony Richards, pointed out later, the poor Luptons were actually extremely unfortunate. ‘To lose all three sons was fairly unusual,’ he explained.It may be more than 100 years since the brothers were killed yet there remains a timeless poignancy to this message of commiseration from George V to a bereft father in Yorkshire who would turn out to be the great great great grandparent of the future George VII.The family had been granted the flimsy consolation of knowing that the bodies of all three of their sons were found, identified and buried in marked graves – unlike the hundreds of thousands merely engraved on memorials to the missing. All three graves are lovingly tended to this day by the gardeners of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.    Kate looked fresh faced as she marvelled at the poppy sculpture situated on the outside of the museum Despite the sombre nature of the visit, the duchess and her hosts were keen to touch on some of the lighter moments contained in the letters. In one of them, Maurice wrote about a soldier adopting a magpie as a pet. In another, he wrote home requesting a consignment of vegetable seeds.‘A very Middleton thing,’ the duchess noted brightly. ‘My grandmother loved gardening. I’ve got a lot to live up to.’ Results have been mixed in the Kensington Palace vegetable patch, by all accounts. ‘You shouldn’t see my cauliflowers,’ the duchess added.She also read a letter from Maurice to his father, making light of life in the trenches – even though his trench occupied such a boggy bit of ground that ‘there is generally only about 18” actually dug and the rest is built up with sandbags or sods, to make a little place you can crawl into for protection from a shell or bullet’.

By the time he went to France in January 1917 with the Leeds Rifles to serve with the all-territorial 62nd (2nd West Riding) Infantry Division, his two brothers had already been killed.He was posted as missing after only six weeks. It was thought he might have been taken prisoner, but two months later his body was found. It was thought he was blown up on patrol.Captain Maurice Lupton  (right)The family’s first casualty of the war, Maurice was killed by a sniper on June 19, 1915, aged 28 – only two months after going to the front line.He joined the Leeds Rifles, became a captain in the 7th battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, the Prince of Wales’ regiment, and was shipped to the support trenches in Belgium as part of the all-territorial 49th (1st West Riding) Infantry Division.He arrived on April 19, 1915. He was one of 2,050 members of the Leeds Rifles to be killed on active service in France and Flanders during the war.Lieut Lionel Lupton  (centre)The youngest of the brothers to lose their lives, he was killed by a German shell at the Battle of the Somme aged only 24 on July 16, 1916.He served with 28th Brigade Royal Field Artillery and had spent a significant amount of time in the front line trenches in France, surviving the Battle of Loos in 1915.He was then wounded on December 1, sent to a hospital in London to recuperate and travelled home for Christmas, where his family was mourning the death of his brother Maurice, before returning to the Western Front.

Writers including Joyce Maynard and Olivia Sudjic consider how this can be resistedWhat does exposure mean for a female writer? It’s a question with which the novelist Olivia Sudjic grapples in a new book-length personal essay, Exposure, just released by the crowdfunded publisher Peninsula Press. In this blend of memoir and critical analysis, Sudjic interrogates her own anxiety around the issue, reflecting on the social media age and critically appraising some of the most urgent contemporary writing by women. In doing so, she references a new canon of sorts, encompassing fiction and non-fiction (and the autofiction that resides between), which includes work by Rachel Cusk, Roxane Gay, Sheila Heti, Chris Kraus and Elena Ferrante.“Although I didn’t want it to be writerly, there wasn’t that much in the way of very contemporary essays about writing,” Sudjic tells me. “There are lots of books and essays about what it means to be a writer in, say, the 1980s, but not many from the social media age.”Yet social media have transformed the way we communicate. They are blamed for an increase in anxiety and for ushering in a culture of “oversharing”, while also providing everyone – not just writers – with the opportunity to create and blur multiple identities.Female writers battle against a range of assumptions. So much of the criticism of women’s writing is explicitly personal – the words on the page aren’t always the only thing reviewed – the author’s mothering, her sexual experiences, her emotional responses all come under “literary” scrutiny. No wonder Elena Ferrante’s refusal to reveal herself is such an affront to some. “Using fiction as a form of defence is very much a symptom of the way that the internet means that we are always having to publicly stand by or defend ourselves even from the threat of attack,” Sudjic tells me.To an extent, categorising the work as fiction or non-fiction isn’t especially helpful. “Novels are never impersonal,” Sudjic says, though she notes that there is sexism at work in how frequently female fiction writers are assumed to have secreted their own lives on the page. Even with memoir, we see the creativity and agency inherent to storytelling stripped from female authors, as though they are merely diarists (not a charge, as the writer Roxane Gay has noted, ever levelled at Karl Ove Knausgaard). Autofiction, meanwhile, is nothing new, arguably just a voguish term for the sorts of roman a clef that have always borrowed heavily from personal experience. Authors such as Virginia Woolf and Sylvia Plath experimented with blurred boundaries long before the current fashion. Yet however you categorise the work, some of the most interesting female authors writing today are similarly experimenting, from Deborah Levy’s two “living autobiographies” to Sheila Heti’s Motherhood.In some ways it couldn’t be more timely. #MeToo has provided a vehicle for women to tell their stories. Though the price they pay may not be as severe as it once was, it still requires bravery to speak the truth of your experience with your real name attached (and, in the case of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, may even get you death threats). It has also seen memoirists such as Joyce Maynard and Mary Karr, who were unfairly blamed for a boom in confessional writing in the 1990s, reappraised.Maynard’s 1998 memoir At Home in the World, which told of her relationship with the much older JD Salinger, was excoriated in the press at the time. In a recent essay for the New York Times, Maynard recounted how she was shunned by the literary establishment, and how one critic used the phrase “that busy Maynard mouth” in reference to a recounted experience of forced oral sex. As late as last year, the Atlantic called Maynard “The Queen of Oversharing”.“I have yet to hear of a male writer (or, simply, a man) accused of ‘oversharing’,” Maynard tells me. “When a male writer exposes raw personal truths (let’s take Knausgaard, for example), he’s simply courageous.”She added: “We certainly pay lip service to the concept that a woman’s stories are now respected and heard. Sadly, this did not occur in the recent Senate judiciary committee hearings over the supreme court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, accused of attempted rape.”Perhaps it’s no coincidence that less than two years after the New Yorker declared the personal essay boom to be “over”, the medium is thriving, with Sudjic’s Exposure being just one example. “All these other systems are failing us,” Sudjic says. “The personal essay is the only medium in which you are trusted, or given the space if you like, to speak directly and not through any of those filters. So you can’t be let down in the same way.”“Obviously you have to be braced for the impact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f6d82c1b3d1a332a9b7f296ba3572c84fdf3099/0_185_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19387a606cffbca120bd068d1ce2a287","title":"lee child joins authors auction names charity margaret atwood julian barnes","story":"In aid of Freedom from Torture, bids invited for a place in new work by the Jack Reacher author and others including Margaret Atwood and Julian BarnesA good number of Jack Reacher fans will have dreamed of joining one of the crime-busting hero’s plots.

Reacher’s creator Lee Child is among a number of well-known authors offering the chance to name a character in their latest books as part of a charity auction in aid of survivors of torture.Man Booker prize winners Margaret Atwood and Julian Barnes are also offering naming rights in forthcoming novels alongside other leading writers including Marian Keyes, Joanna Trollope and Women’s prize 2018 winner Kamila Shamsie.In aid of Freedom from Torture, money raised from the auction will be used to help survivors of torture rebuild their lives. “Torture victims are the most damaged and demoralised people among us, so any move to embrace, console and help them is to be applauded and supported,” Child said of his decision to choose this above other charity requests he receives.He added that the winning bidder will name a character to appear alongside Reacher in Blue Moon, due for publication in 2019. Of the character’s likely personality, the author said he or she will “no doubt be dispensing justice”.Atwood said her involvement in the event, which takes place on 15 November under the name Freedom: Not Just Another Word, was prompted by concerns for the political crisis engulfing the world. “In my novels, I often write about a world that is without liberty and human rights. This fiction is a cruel reality for the torture survivors who are supported by Freedom from Torture.” She added: “This year’s auction is a timely reminder that while the world is an increasingly scary place, our voices are powerful, and we still have the freedom to use them.”As well as naming rights, the lots on offer will include a signed screenplay and other memorabilia donated by Helen Mirren, the chance to commission a large work of art by Quentin Blake and a portrait by political cartoonist and former children’s laureate Chris Riddell.Riddell said he was looking forward to fulfilling his pledge. “I enjoy drawing portraits because most of my children’s book illustration involves drawing imaginary characters, so it is rewarding to draw from life sometimes, especially for such a good cause,” he said.Authors do not guarantee named characters will resemble the winning bidder, although Julian Barnes, who has been involved in the biennial event for a number of years, said two years ago that it was likely they would be sympathetic “unless, of course, you’d like it otherwise in which case you are allowed to specify - though no promises can be made”.Luke Squires’s winning bid from 2004 gives a flavour of what’s in store for successful participants. His money won him the right to appear in an Adam Mars-Jones’s next book. He eventually gave his name to a “sexually precocious schoolboy” in the 2008 novel Pilcrow.Although opening bids are placed at £150 to £250, lots are expected to far exceed these amounts. In 2016, £30,000 was raised for the charity, which has centres across the UK. The highest bid was £2,500, to be a character in Ian McEwan’s next novel.Auctioning off naming rights has become a popular means of fundraising in recent years. As well as helping authors in search of inspiration, the world of botany has used it with great effect.In 2007, an auction to name a new butterfly species held by the Florida Museum of Natural History raised $40,800 (£32,000) after the butterfly was named Opsiphanes blythekitzmillerae, in honour of Margery Minerva Blythe Kitzmiller of Ohio on behalf of her five grandchildren. In June this year, money raised to name a group of newly discovered snail-eating snakes was used for the serpents’ conservations.Game of Thrones creator George RR Martin killed two birds with one stone in 2014, when two fans paid $20,000 each to have a character in their name meet a violent and bloody end in the fantasy saga. The money went to a food bank and a wolf sanctuary. Should the fans tire of waiting for Martin’s next book, eight other bidders were on a waiting list to replace them.Tickets priced £50 each for the Freedom from Torture event, which will be held at the Savoy in London, are on sale now. Would-be bidders unable to attend on the day can submit bids online."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538b6c45a1a764c6dd252583e2c272980bbe8417/0_522_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ede4f2cd3f24602d3a5f048f02e7b202","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Halloween approaches and tiojo has been doing some appropriate reading:I’ve just put down Andrew Michael Hurley’s second novel based in the countryside of the Bowland Fells and the Fylde, Devil’s Day. It follows on well from his first, The Loney. The countryside, which I know well enough, inspires him. But he sees things in it not many of us would. What to us are rolling moors, green valleys, sparkling streams, picturesque farmsteads, signify something else to Mr Hurley. He sees another world. Spiritual, demonic, folkloric, who knows. An unsettling mixture of real and imagined geography gives us the horror version of Le Grande Meaulnes. His novels are psychogeography in action. The moors will look different next time I walk across them.On the same theme, Veufveuve has enjoyed Mary Shelley’s Transformation:A slim collection of short stories (comprising the title story, The Mortal Immortal, and The Evil Eye). All three stories are in some way supernatural or uncanny and the writing, though obviously touched by the gothic and thus sometimes a little overblown, is often very good – she knew what she was doing. All three stories, like Frankenstein, explore what it means to be human and how we might live. For me, by the far the most effective was The Mortal Immortal (I probably don’t need to explain the subject matter), bringing home its great existential crisis very powerfully.A different kind of monster has entertained Kevin Dawson in Craig Brown’s Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret:That rare thing, a genuinely unputdownablelaugh out loud book. Difficult to tell who was the less appealing, Princess Margaret herself or the people who (as Brown notes) happily accepted invites to events at which she would be present, knowing how awful it (and she) would be. They attended seemingly only so they could then skip off home to describe how awful the event was. Increased my respect for George Harrison, though (who, on being told he couldn’t eat before she left a “do” simply went up to her and asked her to leave).This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson has impressed 17Luftballons:It’s about the captain of the Beagle and Darwin. Echoes of Patrick O’Brian’s naval novels but it’s the detail and description that really bring it to life, so vivid and well-described I almost feel like I’m watching a film, or that I’ve visited all these places I’ve never seen. The characters are fascinatingly nuanced and human. And their debates over theology versus their scientific discoveries are really bringing home to me the significance and impact of evolutionary theory at the time. Nice and long, too - I don’t want it to end any time soon!A forensic and very readable analysis of The Iliad and the different strands that informed its creation. Utterly fascinating and totally recommended for armchair Homer fans and general readers alike.Here’s a teaser from casaleiro:About 10 days ago the  carried an interview with a Spanish writer who recommended A High Wind in Jamaica by Richard Hughes. Never heard of it! So down the town I went and found a copy in a charity shop. It was a fabulous discovery, and I am currently following it by re-reading William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. What the two have in common is their view of childhood as a wild and potentially violent state of being. I guess most readers are familiar with Golding. Concerning the older novel by Hughes (1929), I will say nothing, I simply urge people to read it, preferably without knowing anything about it beforehand.I’m intrigued. Talking of suspense, franhunny has been reading Agatha Christie’s Mrs McGinty’s Dead:While I usually loathe Poirot because of his smugness, it was not as bad as in other Poirot novels so I could live with it as a quirk.Which made the book quite enjoyable. Oh, I knew the murderer after the second murder, but I did not know why yet and how the two murders were connected.A classic whodunnit, with the classic “all suspects into the same room” finale where Mr Poirot explains his thoughts.A few hours well spent.(I’m glad it felt like a good investment of time, because we’re going to be looking at Agatha Christie on the reading group next month.)Finally, Tropic of Capricorn by Henry Miller has done the trick for judgeDAmNationIII:I’m about halfway through rereading and my God is it the tonic I need at the moment. I remember being relatively unimpressed with it the first time around (at least compared to the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy and Black Spring, which I read first), and although there are parts that go on a bit, the rest of it just feels like it’s screaming directly into my soul.That sounds pretty good to me.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

A series of influential reports have said that avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way consumers can reduce their environmental impact on the planet, because farming animals is such a CO2-intensive process.“It’s extremely encouraging to learn how many Britons are choosing to reduce their consumption of animal products” said Nick Palmer, the head of Compassion in World Farming UK. “Science proves that the healthiest diet is one that is plant-heavy. By eating less meat, fish, eggs and dairy and choosing higher welfare when we do, we can all help animals, people and the planet.”The Waitrose report is based on research among shoppers across all British supermarket chains. The retailer’s executive chef, Jonathan Moore, said: “Vegetarianism has grown and evolved. More people dip in and out of it. There was a time when choosing a plant-based diet was about taking an ethical stand based on unwavering principles. For many, this distinction between vegetarians and meat-eaters still exists but for others the lines have blurred.”Publication of the findings represents awkward timing for Waitrose. It comes a day after the editor of its food magazine, William Sitwell, said he was stepping down after an email exchange with a freelance journalist emerged in which he mocked vegans and suggested they should be force-fed meat.The number of vegans in the UK, who shun all animal products including dairy and eggs, has grown fourfold in the past four years from 150,000 to 600,000, according to the Vegan Society. Waitrose was the first UK supermarket to install dedicated vegan sections in 134 of its stores in May. It has also launched a range of more than 40 vegan and vegetarian ready meals. Vegan dining out is also booming, the report notes, with the Good Food Guide highlighting restaurants with dedicated vegan menus for the first time this year after many high street chains and pubs increased their non-meat-and-dairy options.“This year, we’ve seen vegan food go mainstream” said Natalie Mitchell, Waitrose’s head of brand development. “Whether cooking at home, buying prepared food or trying the newly vegan-friendly restaurants, people are discovering that it tastes amazing.”Waitrose’s managing director, Rob Collins, said: “Being mindful of how we live and eat has become a priority in today’s world. As we become increasingly mindful of our own health, the wellbeing of our family and that of the planet, we’re reshaping how we shop, cook and eat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be714bb7d27b6c92dd25c0e5a3d601b1178d976c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2addebf86457b43361657fd4797c890e","title":"tories state force for good ghost thatcher","story":"The party has been gripped by the ghost of Thatcher. But as this week’s budget shows, many MPs still believe in the role of governmentAccording to WH Auden, all good dramas consist of two contrasting acts: “First, the making of a mistake then, the discovery that it was a mistake.” A similar corrective arc often also applies in politics. On the issue of the progressive role of the state, the late-20th-century Conservative party made a historic mistake. Now it is struggling with the dawning of discovery.The single most obvious thing to say about the Tory party in autumn 2018 is that it is split over Brexit. But the significance of the Tory ide on Brexit, and its tendency to dominate all aspects of domestic political coverage, masks another internal argument – one that is more important in terms of the party’s history, and may hold the key to its future too.This second argument is about the necessary role of government in shaping economic and social policy. One way or another, this is an issue that has woven its way through Conservative history since the late 18th century. Tory leaders from William Pitt the Younger to Theresa May have confronted it. Philip Hammond’s budget this week was a striking embodiment of why the issue is both enduringly important and still politically unresolved.His budget was not the end of austerity. But it was unquestionably a decisive move away from it. If the austerity doctrine of 2010-18 had still been in full force, the £68bn windfall in government receipts over the next five years announced this week would have been overwhelmingly used to get the finances back in the black by the mid 2020s as planned. Instead, the normally cautious Hammond chose to spend the lot, mainly on the NHS, but also in a cluster of short-term giveaways and to pump another £15bn into the economy next year.This would not have happened in the previous eight years. It has happened because May is trying to reposition her party more centrally on domestic policy in the aftermath of the Brexit deal she hopes to secure. May herself would probably have gone further this week.May and Hammond are not trying to “out-Corbyn Corbyn”, as former chancellor George Osborne put it this week in an interview in which he offered a mea culpa on the EU referendum but not on austerity. But they see the need to counter the Labour leader. This was in many respects a holding budget, but it placed anti-austerity options in tax and spending and in the role of government back on to the Tory agenda.May and Hammond are a bit like a couple circling a roundabout in their car, debating which route to follow, but clear which one they should no longer take.This is where Auden’s point comes in. Many times in its pre-1975 history, the Conservative party found its way, often against its supporters’ instincts and interests, towards strengthening the role of government in rebalancing the economy in favour of the poor and the moderately waged. From Robert Peel’s reintroduction of peacetime income tax in 1842 onwards, the one-nation tradition was the key to the party’s famous ability to reinvent itself.The problem the modern Tory party faces is not confined to the unpopularity of austerity. Its roots lie in the period after 1975, when Margaret Thatcher – massively aided by the press – captured the party with her rejection of postwar Keynesianism in favour of an agenda of privatisation, small government, tax cuts and inidualism. It won the Tories four successive elections. But it was also massively destructive and isive.The Conservatives have not won a decisive general election majority since Thatcher did so in 1987. John Major, David Cameron and May have all led weak governments. In spite of efforts by all three, the party seems unable to move decisively beyond Thatcherism or to reconnect fully with its one-nation past at a time when it is needed. As one senior Tory put it bluntly to me recently: “We will never win a clear majority while we remain in thrall to Margaret Thatcher.”Brexit is tightly bound in to this problem. Most ardent Brexiteers are ardent Thatcherites, just as most Thatcherites are Brexiteers. Many of the most threadbare of the Brexit fantasies – those about easy free trade deals, a no-deal break with the EU, Singapore-style deregulation and Britain’s supposedly enhanced standing in the world – contain ghostly echoes of Thatcher.But the central issue is political economy. In 1938, Harold Macmillan warned the Tory party: “Unless we can continue this peaceful evolution from a free capitalism to planned capitalism, or, it may be, a new synthesis of capitalist and socialist theory, there will be little hope of preserving the civil, democratic and cultural freedoms.” No Tory MP would write in such terms today. But the essence of this warning remains valid on many levels 80 years on.Today’s party contains more MPs who relate to Macmillan’s approach than you would ever guess from the constant publicity given to the Brexiteers. The most prominent of these is May herself, with her repeated – but unfulfilled – commitment to the section in the 2017 manifesto that said “government can and should be a force for good – and its power should be put squarely at the service of this country’s working people”.May is not alone. Justine Greening said this week that the Tories should “get into the centre ground” and that they had not properly connected with the public in more than 30 years. George Freeman wrote in September that aspirational professional voters under 45 are rejecting the old politics. “Unless the Conservative party reconnects with them, we risk becoming a rump party of nostalgic nationalists,” he claimed. Nicky Morgan wrote last month that “we cannot secure growth in the 21st century by following a 20th-century model”. Jesse Norman, in his recent book on Adam Smith, writes: “It is easy to forget the central importance of the state in his thought, as protector of the nation, adjudicator and enforcer of justice … provider of public works, infrastructure and local schools, and, yes, as regulator of markets.” Most of the 2010 and 2015 Tory intakes share these instincts.These MPs do not have identical views. But they all share the crucial recognition that government is, as the US writer Garry Wills puts it, “a necessary good not a necessary evil”. If Labour people tend to be too starry-eyed about government, too many Tories, influenced by Thatcher’s aberrant period of power, tend to be unduly distrustful of it. The public, who depend on good government, do not share either view.The most interesting current question in British politics is this: what comes after May’s Tories and Corbyn’s Labour? My guess is that a large part of the answer will depend on the road May and Hammond decide to take off the roundabout to which they have belatedly returned this week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/142de876de7810787470329977f262d9f1de142d/0_0_6690_4134/master/6690.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f9e82fc876eab32ff13b275a93ac640","title":"how to be cultured on the cheap budget arts schemes","story":"A seat in the gods is not the only way to get culture on the cheap. Card deals, theatre clubs and lunchtime gigs are all up for grabs … and you could even hang a masterpiece on your own wallOne of the founding myths about culture is that it’s inaccessible: barely a month goes by without a news story about opera being too exclusive or theatre-lovers being priced out of their seats. There’s a grain of truth to that, of course. Temporary exhibits at major museums such as the National Gallery in London have passed £20 and, according to recent research, top-price tickets for over half the shows in London’s West End go for over £100 (let alone associated costs such as transport and eating out).But it doesn’t need to be that way. Compared to many countries, we in Britain get a pretty good deal when it comes to culture, buttressed by schemes such as free admission for national museums, enshrined under the Labour government in 2001, and arts councils and National Lottery funding, which keeps prices down and many arts organisations alive.And there are ways to game the system, if you’re on it: membership or newsletter discounts on-the-day tickets and lottery systems at theatres pay-what-you-can events free festivals off-peak cinema deals. Major theatre and opera events are now screened in cinemas for a fraction of what they cost to see live, and nearly every arts centre in the country offers some kind of community scheme, so make sure to check (and of course support your local venue). If you’re a public-sector or key worker, you can often access discounts. And if you’re lucky enough to be aged under 26, most arts institutions are only too desperate to get you hooked – so make the most of it while it lasts.Below we list some of the best cultural deals available currently, area by area – but of course it’s only a fraction of what’s on offer.

Here’s the lowdown on Ontario – Canada’s natural playgroundCanadians don’t like to boast, but Ontario is bigger than Texas. Most of the province’s 14 million inhabitants live in its cities, so vast swathes of land, particularly in the north, remain a natural playground. World-class centres such as Toronto, Canada’s largest metropolis, and Ottawa, the country’s capital, make a great base to explore Ontario’s awe-inspiring destinations, including Niagara Falls, the many national parks, or the majestic Great Lakes …Wine lovers should head for the Niagara peninsula, to enjoy tastings amid the rolling vineyards on its scenic Wine Routes (there are approximately 95 vineyards that offer tastings). Few come away without at least a bottle of the region’s famous German-style ice wine from the likes of Peller Estates. Ontario also has cideries, distilleries and a lots of craft breweries. Pair local wines and beers with fresh local produce in “farm to fork” restaurants. Some of the best are in the Niagara region, around busy Niagara Falls and the historic town of Niagara-on-the-Lake try Treadwell Cuisine for dishes that use simple, tasty ingredients such as heirloom tomatoes and microgreens. Prince Edward County, another wine-growing area on Lake Ontario, is known locally as Ontario’s Gastronomic Capital embark on the region’s Taste Trail, which links restaurants, artisanal producers, and wine and spirits retailers. Mennonite farmers still bring their produce to market in St Jacobs by horse and buggy around the town of Elora, whose pretty, traditional main street is lined with restaurants. Local specialities include the maple syrup or cheeses of Ontario, German-style sausages in the Kitchener-Waterloo region, or fresh pickerel and smoked trout from one of the many lakes of the north. Northern Ontario can feel like a place apart, and it has its own delicacies. These include spruce tips, harvested in spring and added to salad or pesto for a citrus flavour, and birch syrup (yep, the local version of maple syrup). You may also like spruce beer the taste of pine works for Greek retsina so why not beer? Try it at Full Beard Brewing, in Timmins.The ethnic ersity of immigrants to Ontario has left its mark on the province’s culture, seen in local festivities such as the Scottish Highland Games in Fergus and Kitchener-Waterloo’s Oktoberfest. There are even deeper roots in the many Pow-Wows celebrating the music, dance and traditional culture of the Indigenous People. The Pow-Wow on Manitoulin Island is one of the most authentic, while the annual Canadian Aboriginal festival in Hamilton attracts thousands of dancers from all over North America. The Toronto Caribbean Carnival is regularly enjoyed by about 1 million revellers. Music festivals cover the range from classical to modern but jazz sounds a dominant note, with annual festivals throughout the province, from Orillia and Guelph, to Ottawa and Prince Edward County, as well as Toronto and its notable Beaches Jazz festival. Quaint Elora showcases classical, folk, pop and jazz music in its annual festival, while Ottawa also puts on a Bluesfest. Northern Ontario, around Thunder Bay and Sault Ste Marie, is host to Culture Days every September, highlighting local talent in the arts. Sault Ste Marie’s WTF festival in June also brings the best of Canadian comedy to the region. For theatre, lovely Stratford is (obviously) the home of a Shakespeare festival, and Niagara-on-the-Lake celebrates the work of George Bernard Shaw and his contemporaries. Ottawa’s National Arts Centre is Canada’s largest centre for the performing arts, with theatre as well as opera, ballet and contemporary dance. You’ll also find Canada’s impressive National Gallery in the capital, which features masterpieces of Canadian and Indigenous art.Much of Northern Ontario is a playground for lovers of the great outdoors, a place where bears, wolves and moose still roam wild. This great Canadian Shield landscape of endless forest is best explored by floatplanes. Fishermen, hikers, canoeists and campers are dropped off at remote lodges, such as Lodge 88, to experience nights around the campfire under epic night skies as part of a “fly-in” wilderness experience. More sedate visitors simply rent a houseboat and enjoy fishing in some of the 70,000 lakes of “Sunset Country” in the north-west. Nearer to Toronto are provincial parks such as Algonquin, 7,800 square miles of lakes and forests, with 1,000 miles of canoe trails. In winter, it’s time to break out cross-country skis, snowshoes, dog sleds and snowmobiles. Niagara Falls is a complete contrast, with its casinos and thrill rides. Ride a helicopter over the falls, get soaked by its thundering spray on a jetboat, or brave the MistRider zipline.Ontario’s hot summer and cold winter are the best times to explore the outdoors, with the spring ideal for enjoying its cities – autumn, with its magnificent colours, offers the best of both. In summer, locals escape the city heat for weekend cottages along the shores of the Great Lakes or by the water in Northern Ontario. This is when resort towns come alive with music and arts festivals, and vineyards and restaurants thrive. In winter, the first essential is to take in an ice-hockey game. If that inspires you, the Rideau canal outside Ottawa is the place to try ice-skating yourself. Be warned: pretty much every Canadian can skate backwards. Yes, that’s a dare.Discover how to experience Ontario and book your perfect holiday with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1894743a30428e19199ecb2ec227f94690777e1/674_63_1589_953/master/1589.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96fb136faccfc83d8aaca4cdd2568ac0","title":"eleven teachers sent home after refusing to teach violent pupils","story":"Kaimes school in Edinburgh at centre of row between local council and NASUWT unionA school in Edinburgh has sent 11 teachers home without pay for refusing to teach or supervise pupils they say are abusive and violent.The council has said staff should not be allowed to decide who they teach, but a union has accused local government of failing in its duty of care.The teachers at Kaimes school in Liberton, a special school for primary and secondary pupils with additional needs, said the eight pupils in question pose a risk to health, safety and welfare.The NASUWT union, of which the 11 teachers are members, balloted for industrial action on refusing to teach or supervise certain pupils earlier this year.The violent abuse against the teachers reportedly includes having chairs and signs thrown at them. It is understood that police were called to some incidents.Union representatives will meet with the Scottish education secretary, John Swinney, to discuss the disagreement after talks between the council and the NASUWT broke down.Chris Keates, NASUWT’s general secretary, said: “The teachers, and indeed other pupils at the school have, month after month, faced violent physical assaults, a constant stream of verbal abuse and threats and malicious allegations. Equipment has been smashed and classrooms trashed.“Rather than supporting the teachers to deal with these pupils, Edinburgh city council instead has embarked on a campaign of aggressive and punitive actions towards the teachers, simply because they have dared to stand up for what is right.“The council has sought to bully and intimidate the teachers in a meeting, has stopped all their salary and, despite the fact they are turning up to work each day willing and ready, not only to take their timetabled classes and teach the overwhelming majority of the pupils, but also to provide appropriate work for the eight pupils, they have been refused entry to their classrooms and told to leave the school premises.“Instead of allowing them to carry on their teaching and other duties, the council is apparently bringing in senior non-teaching staff, supply teachers and other staff from across the authority.“It quite frankly beggars belief that a council prefers to disrupt not only the education of the majority of pupils at Kaimes, but also potentially pupils at other schools, rather than dealing with the pupils who are at the centre of the teachers’ concerns.”She added: “Teachers are entitled to a safe working environment and pupils are entitled to learn in safety, free from violence and disruption.“This is one of the most disturbing cases I have ever experienced of an employer failing in its duty of care, not only for staff, but also for the pupils at the school.”A spokesman for Edinburgh council told the BBC: “An improvement action plan for Kaimes school has been developed in consultation with staff and subject to external expert scrutiny. This is in the very early stages of being implemented and we would urge everyone to work with us as we take this plan forward. The council has been trying to engage with NASUWT at all levels to discuss any concerns they have and we are disappointed that they have failed to respond positively to date and decided on this course of action.“We cannot have a situation where staff decide who they are and who they are not willing to teach as this would be contrary to their terms of employment.”The council said it remained committed to working with staff to improve attainment and deliver a positive working environment at the school."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddedb45b3127360fa949edd3434c0105bff31e23/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef8c8fe34bca986c7da11c77b82af2fc","title":"five countries hold 70 of worlds last wildernesses map reveals","story":"First map of Earth’s intact ecosystems shows just five nations are responsible for most of them – but it will require global action to protect themResearchers from the University of Queensland (UQ) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) have for the first time produced a global map that sets out which countries are responsible for nature that is devoid of heavy industrial activity.It comes ahead of the conference of parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Egypt in November where signatory nations are working towards a plan for the protection of bioersity beyond 2020.Conservationists are calling for a mandated target for wilderness conservation that will preserve the planet’s vulnerable ecosystems.The UQ and WCS study, published in the journal Nature, identifies Australia, the US, Brazil, Russia and Canada as the five countries that hold the vast majority of the world’s remaining wilderness.The data excludes untouched wilderness in Antarctica and on the high seas that is not contained within national borders.The paper comes after the team of scientists produced data in 2016 that charted the planet’s remaining terrestrial wilderness and in 2018 examined which parts of the world’s oceans remained free from the damaging impacts of human activity.“Two years ago we did the first analysis of wilderness on land,” lead author James Watson said.“In this new analysis we’ve created a global map and intersected it with national borders to ask: who is responsible?”The researchers say that the planet’s remaining wilderness can be protected “only if it is recognised within international policy frameworks”.He said the five countries responsible for most of the world’s remaining wilderness had to provide leadership and could act to protect these areas through legislation or by offering incentives to businesses that do not erode nature.John Robinson, the executive vice-president for global conservation at WCS, said wilderness would only be secured globally “if these nations take a leadership role”.“Already we have lost so much. We must grasp these opportunities to secure the wilderness before it disappears forever,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e534af84c0f2d03dc63a00c50c16a23a8119b101/0_316_1622_973/master/1622.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eedeb9001d11d586348253069d4e2a0a","title":"who belongs in the everyday cycling hall of fame","story":"As a new road cycling pantheon is launched, we ask who should be honoured for their efforts to promote cycling for all. Add your suggestions in the comments and we’ll select some of the best in a future postThe world of mountain biking has had a hall of fame since 1988. Road cycling has a few of them, including a UK-centric one from British Cycling – and now a new international one from Rouleur magazine launching on Thursday. But, to the best of my knowledge, transportation cycling has never had one.Nature abhors a vacuum, so here’s our chance to start the Everyday Cycling Hall of Fame. I’ve taken the liberty of suggesting who I think ought to be the first 10 inductees. Who would you include?He also suggested readers who witnessed an attack on a cyclist from a car should “beat the assailant up black and blue” and, despite being an animal lover, he also had some sage but brutal advice for a cyclist attacked by a dog: “Ram your entire arm down his throat. He will choke and die.”Ballantine’s book imagined a utopian future of cycleways, but he didn’t think this would be sufficient to get more people cycling. “Bikeways are not enough,” he wrote. “What is needed is the elimination of polluting transportation … the absolute elimination of internal combustion engines from urban areas is the practical solution which benefits everybody.”In 2007, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg appointed Sadik-Khan as his commissioner of transportation. An everyday cyclist, she took the city’s existing bicycle plan and made it flesh, installing cycleways and closing Times Square to cars.Her first success was with a semi-protected cycleway on Manhattan’s Ninth Avenue. Cyclists flocked to the route and businesses along the way saw their sales blossom. Today, the city boasts more than 120 miles of protected cycleways. Now a principal with Bloomberg Associates, a philanthropic enterprise that works with mayors around the world to improve quality of life, she’s still advocating for cycleways via her role as chair of Nacto, the US National Association of Transportation Officials.The Scouse cycling champion made his name winning Olympic gold in the Barcelona velodrome in 1992, kickstarting the success of Britain’s racing cyclists, but his most lasting legacy may be the 1,000 miles of safe cycling and walking routes he’s helping to install in Greater Manchester. The £1.5bn network will be the largest joined-up network in the UK. “We are reclaiming streets so that they work for people first,” Boardman said at the project launch.Many cycle advocates dream that Boardman will one day be made the UK’s “cycling tsar,” a role he could do in his sleep.She’s no longer involved in the day-to-day running of Newcastle’s Recyke Y’Bike recycling project she founded in 2006, but Craw is still a guiding light for the charity. The workshop – like a growing number of similar ones around the UK – takes in donated bikes, which are refurbished or stripped for parts. The bikes are then sold to fund the project, or they are given away to schools, community groups, and iniduals on low incomes. 500 or so are sent annually to development projects in Kenya and the Gambia. The UK bikes are often provided to refugees and asylum seekers who “get a very small amount to live on while their case is considered,” said Craw.“Typically they have to travel quite large local distances to register with local authorities, meet their caseworkers and so on. Some days it can mean making the choice between eating or buying the bus ticket to meet these appointments: a bike solves this.”Craw is representative of the likeminded recycling project leaders around the world who, with little fanfare, promote cycling as a viable form of transportation for otherwise disadvantaged iniduals.Breeze is already in one hall – he was a charter member of the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame. In 1977, the Californian designed and built what is considered the first modern mountain bike, the Breezer No 1, helping create the mountain bike market. “To us the mountain bike was a lark,” Breeze said “but, by golly, it got more people on to bicycles than any machine since the 1890s.”In 2002, way ahead of the curve, Breeze launched a line of transportation-specific bikes, and the company still has a wide range of practical, everyday bikes.When he was a junior engineer in the Ministry of Transport, Claxton helped design some of the 500 miles of protected cycleways that the UK government installed in the 1930s. The cycleways he worked on in London were sub-standard, admitted Claxton.In 2007, Canadian-Danish urban designer Colville-Andersen spawned the “cycle chic” movement by photographing people cycling around Copenhagen in their stylish civvies. The influential Copenhagen Cycle Chic blog led to copies in cities around the world and brought many new people into cycling. “So many people in other countries have been brainwashed into believing that cycling is just a sport or a hobby and haven’t entertained the thought that it could be a daily transport activity,” he said in 2008. “So many Copenhageners ride in style, on normal bikes, and in normal clothes. Even those who are not chic, ride with an ease and elegance that borders on poetry.”Colville-Andersen ended his early posts with the dictum “Copenhagenize the planet”, and in 2009 he founded the Copenhagenize Design Company to spread his everyday-cycling message. This grew into a large consultancy, advising cities on how to become more cycle friendly.Spanish-born Hidalgo recently tweeted a graphic of a cyclist above a car – the cyclist was the “solution” while the car was the “pollution”. This is the sort of tweet you’d expect from a velorutionary, not the mayor of Paris. But then Hidalgo is an outspoken champion of utility cycling in the French capital, mainly because of her virulent opposition to the air pollution spewed out by motor vehicles.Starting in 2016, she introduced “Paris Respire” (or Paris Breathes), a plan to ban all cars from certain areas of Paris on the first Sunday of the month. She also championed the creation of a walking and cycling route beside the River Seine, carved out of a former busy – and fume-filled – highway. The Berges de Seine park recently won a significant legal victory, and Hidalgo plans to get even more motors out of Paris.Urban anthropologist Adonia Lugo of Los Angeles has been a bike advocate for 10 years, including time spent lobbying in Washington DC. She co-founded Los Angeles’s open streets car-free cycling event, CicLAvia and recently wrote BicycleRace: Transportation, Culture, \u0026amp Resistance, a book dealing with transportation equity, mobility justice and racism.For Brexity reasons I’d rather not give Boris Johnson yet more oxygen but, from a transportation cycling point of view, he is unavoidably important.It could be argued that Johnson was a late and, at times, reluctant champion of kerb-protected cycleways (London’s first Cycle Superhighways were daubed with not-at-all-protective blue paint) but the then mayor later developed the zeal of a convert, and it’s unlikely London would now have its short but significant mileage of world-class cycleways if Johnson hadn’t been at the helm.That said, it could be argued that instead of Johnson it should be journalist Andrew Gilligan getting the charter status in this hall of fame. As Johnson’s cycling commissioner, it was gimlet-eyed Gilligan who thought big, planned with precision and wouldn’t take no for an answer. Johnson may have signed it off and fronted it, but the bold £1bn plan for transforming cycling in London was mostly Gilligan’s work.• Who would you include?

So should we stop enriching billionaires accused of bullying?I guess I should stop shopping at Topman. Those allegations against Sir Philip Green are completely shocking! Daniel, by emailUm, are they? That’s sweet, Daniel. For the rest of us, learning that the businessman at the centre of allegations of sexual harassment and racism is none other than Sir Philip Green – the Penguin from Batman Returns made flesh – was only mildly less surprising than hearing about the toilet habits of bears. (Blah blah, Green denies all allegations, says he’s done nothing more than “banter” and he’s sorry for causing any offence and yadda yadda yadda, which is official Jewish legal language.)Come with me, dear readers, as I take you back – back to the future! No, sorry, wrong direction: reverse DeLorean because we are going back to the past! Back to a year when I was a young, plucky reporter, and was packed off to Oxford Street to interview Green in his office, only to find him in full fury when I arrived.“Get her out of here, she’s an antisemite, she works for the fucking !” Green shouted from behind his desk before I’d said a word. Now, in case it is not clear from how I write, literally the only person who has ever looked and sounded more Jewish than me is Janice from Friends, so Green’s claim that I am an antisemite was a bit of a surprise, but in retrospect it should not have been. I have an exciting – and timely! – revelation to make to my readers: as well as being Jewish, I am a witch.Yes, I doubted this initially, too, mainly because I am very much a dog person, and there is not enough hair product in the world to deal with what flying on a broom would do to my Jewfro. But once it was confirmed that Green was the businessman at the centre of the allegations I knew my witchiness was undeniable, and that is because nearly every person who has ever been horrible to me has suffered terrible repercussions. There is Sir Phil, as we know. Then there was Harvey Weinstein, who threw me out of several parties in LA because someone once wrote something in the  he didn’t like. And then I wrote something he really didn’t like – that his parties are boring – and he was so outraged that he wrote an op-ed in THIS PAPER in which he described going through the  comments section to find disparaging remarks about me, which sounds like totally normal, sane and balanced behaviour. (He found only one seriously, try harder, Harvey. You have time on your hands now.) All I need now is some comeuppance for the A-list actor who walked out of my interview with him “because I don’t talk to the work-experience kid” (I was 27) and the celebrity chef who literally spat in my face (“Who do you work for?” “.” “I fucking hate the ! Pah!” Handy hint: it wasn’t Delia), and vindication will be mine, all mine. And, given how strong I think we can all see my witch powers are, that day is clearly nigh. So live in fear, Nigella (legal notice: it was not Nigella).Anyway, back to Green. What I find interesting about this saga is – after the many allegations that have come out this week – how few people (except you, Daniel) were surprised when the story broke. Indeed, the only surprise was at the prospect that Green might suffer repercussions. In that way, the public reaction was reminiscent of when the whole #MeToo movement erupted. Yes, many of those cases are very different from Green’s (yadda yadda yadda), but the point is, beforehand, rumours of Weinstein’s and so on’s behaviour were just kind of tacitly accepted because people didn’t think anything could change. #MeToo changed that: allegations of bullying and sexual abuse are now seen not as inidual cases but reflections of a serious, systemic problem. It is therefore a public obligation to speak out and to support the people who take it on.As for Sir Phil, then: yes, I think you should stop giving him your money. Whatever the allegations, whether he’s guilty or not, none of us should help enrich billionaires who slap their employees with NDAs and whack injunctions on the press. Also, let’s be honest, we all know he’s a schmuck. The British establishment may never be able to wrest his knighthood from his pudgy hands but your money deserves better than that. Anyway, Topshop and Topman are rubbish these days. Come at me, Phil. You know where to find me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c36febca6aa50da4c67953ac9d02af74b2c3a3/51_650_1927_1156/master/1927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=def936ca729a9b0c53dac354c5590572","title":"the big freeze what to wear in november in pictures","story":"It’s all change, weather-wise.

Nae Pasaran, a powerful documentary, tells their storyThe artificial spiders’ webs hanging in the windows of the Royal British Legion in East Kilbride, on the edge of Glasgow, are just part of the Halloween decorations. But they feel oddly appropriate on this bright, frosty morning in the company of men whose distant triumphs have recently had the cobwebs dusted off them. Sitting off to one side is the 41-year-old Chilean film-maker Felipe Bustos Sierra. Huddled around a table next to him are the former Rolls Royce plant workers whose bold statement of solidarity with the Chilean people in the mid-1970s is the subject of Nae Pasaran!, an inspirational documentary that proves principled acts can have positive consequences – even if they take decades to come to light.Six months after the bloody coup of 11 September 1973, which began the brutal 17-year dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, these four Scotsmen – Bob Fulton, Robert Somerville, John Keenan, Stuart Barrie – downed tools and refused to service and repair engines for the Chilean air force’s Hawker Hunter planes. “Down tools?” says Bob, a former engine inspector and the instigator of the boycott. “We hadnae time to pick ’em up!”Bob is 95 now, a gentle man with expansive hand gestures who sometimes holds on to the sides of the table while he talks, as if he’s planning to drive it away. He can still remember vividly the events of that March day in 1974: “I got to my desk in the morning and there was this compressor shaft up on the table ready for me to inspect. The first thing you do is check the card. Well, I turned the card round.” He acts out the scene, flipping a beermat over and staring disbelievingly at the underside. “And there it was: Chile.”“We had already condemned the Chilean junta,” adds Stuart, who is 74. John, the 78-year-old former assembly unit worker and member of the works committee, leans in to clarify. “The people being tortured and murdered, many of them were just like us: trade unionists. At our monthly meeting, Robert had made a motion condemning the actions in Chile. And then when Bob recognised the engines – well, you tell him!”Bob jabs a finger at me. “This is true,” he says, and I notice Felipe giving the fond smile of someone who has had that finger jabbed at him plenty of times. “I went to the foreman and said, ‘I cannae work on that.’ From there, I went to see Stuart, who was a shop steward, and told him there were bits and pieces of the Chilean engine possibly on the line already.” Stuart is chuckling: “I can hear him shouting, ‘There’s Chilean engines in here! The whole place is awash with ’em!’” Everyone falls about at his impersonation. “I would say you were somewhat volatile at times,” says Stuart.“I might’ve been,” replies Bob, in a voice softer than falling snow.“I told Bob, ‘Right. That’s it. We’ll black the fuckers.’” Blacking entailed attaching labels with the word “black” on them to each contested part, warning everyone in the plant to steer clear of them. The four engines – which had likely come from the Hawker Hunters involved in the attack on the presidential palace in Santiago – were eventually dumped outside in crates. Without protection from the elements, they were useless within a year.In theory, the men could have been sacked for their protest, but the strength of the unions made that unlikely. “The only reason we could do what we did was because we were organised,” explains John. “We took strike action for the NHS, the Shrewsbury pickets, you name it.” But this was something different: a high-profile international case that brought hope to people 7,000 miles away.Precisely how much hope, and to what end, had remained unclear until Felipe started researching his film six years ago. It was widely known that Hortensia Bussi de Allende – the widow of Salvador Allende, the democratically elected Marxist president killed in the coup – visited Glasgow in 1975 and expressed publicly her gratitude. Hundreds of letters of thanks poured in over the years, too, and Robert helped to resettle Chilean refugees in Lanarkshire as early as 1974.“It was perfect, perfect,” he says now of the community’s reaction. “The amount of help we got – from the council, who gave them houses, and Rolls-Royce, who asked for people to help out by donating white goods.” It sounds a world away from the hostility that can accompany the arrival of refugees today. “Aye,” says Stuart sadly. “There was no trace of what you see now.”The men always felt the story was unfinished, though, not least because of the way the boycott ended: after four years, the engines were mysteriously stolen in the middle of the night by vehicles with false licence plates. “It was as if the SAS had done it,” says Bob. “Obviously the government, no question,” says Stuart. “But personally, I’ve always seen it as a victory. They can only fly so many hours before they need to be overhauled – and we stopped that, didn’t we?”Indeed, the film tracks down Fernando Rojas Vender, the unrepentant former commander of Chile’s air force, who makes clear the extent of the damage done. The entire squadron of 29 Hawker Hunters was close to being grounded by the boycott. Although India, Israel and South Africa came to Pinochet’s aid, probably with spare parts, East Kilbride was the only place in the world where those engines could be properly repaired.The boycott was familiar to Felipe: as the son of a journalist exiled to Belgium after the coup, he remembered hearing East Kilbride mentioned at solidarity meetings. “I’d been told that many of the original guys had passed on, so I was intending the film to be fiction not documentary. Then, when I met them, I realised they’re natural born storytellers. That matches the way Chilean solidarity has been told over the years, as oral history.”Robert was wary of revisiting the boycott, though, having been stung in the past by inaccurate reporting, while Stuart harboured little affection for those days. “I was about as interested in anything to do with Rolls-Royce as I was in the location of my last shite.”When I ask Stuart what changed his mind, Felipe jogs his memory: it was the footage of Chilean political prisoners remembering how the protest saved their lives. Most government records were destroyed, but the film argues convincingly that members of the air force who had been sympathetic to Allende – and were imprisoned and tortured under Pinochet – may in fact have had their freedom granted in exchange for those Hawker Hunter engines.“I remember watching that with you,” says Felipe, “and you kind of lost your sense of humour a bit.” Stuart agrees: “When those guys discussed the impact it had, I was impressed. Some people would be broken after what they’d been through. But they had got up again. I was touched by that. And I make an effort not to get touched too much.” Bob is more forthright: “It was a bit emotional watching all that. I think it’s a cracker of a film.”Felipe says one of the first questions he was asked by the men was whether he could find out what happened to the engines. And one of the offending items does make a cameo appearance near the end of the film. How did it feel to see it again? “It was a good feeling,” says Stuart. “Ah, it was just an engine,” sighs Bob, to much laughter, though he brightens at the news that it will soon be on display permanently in East Kilbride. “I think it has affected Chileans more than these guys,” Felipe tells me, “because so much from Chilean history has been destroyed. Finding tangible evidence is quite a rare thing.”The men are long retired and the sprawling plant has fallen silent: it closed in 2015 and was demolished the following year. But the question raised implicitly by the film is whether something like the East Kilbride boycott could ever happen again. “Anyone today who wants to mirror what these guys did is taking a much bigger personal risk,” says Felipe, citing the lack of trade unions. “But considering what’s happening now, some of us are going to have to take that risk.”Bob gives it some thought. “I’m not sure.

Spurs’ plans to recoup the £850m construction costs include vaulting revenues from the 62,062-seat stadium itself and all its hospitality packages, two NFL games and six concerts a year, the “Tottenham Experience” visitors’ centre with Europe’s largest football club shop, a 180-bed hotel and 579 apartments in four blocks for which the club has planning permission.Already completed are regeneration extras Spurs have helped construct, as agreed with the London Borough of Haringey in an area blighted by severe deprivation and the 2011 riots: a large Sainsbury’s supermarket, a new sixth-form college, 256 new homes officially classed as “affordable” and a new primary school.Directly opposite all this rebuilding and activity is Tottenham High Road west, a densely packed neighbourhood of shops, small industrial estates and the Love Lane council estate, which is in a wholly contrasting standoff. Here, Spurs are in furious disagreement with Haringey council over development plans small businesses protest they are being forced out, and insecure residents live in fear of the future because of the borough’s severe housing shortage, with 10,000 households on the council’s waiting list and 3,000 families in temporary accommodation. revealed in 2013 that Spurs had been buying up fistfuls of properties in the High Road west area, including industrial units, shops – even flats dotted about. The properties were transferred to the ownership of TH Property Ltd, a company registered in the Bahamas, the offshore tax haven where the club’s majority owner, Joe Lewis, is based. Local garage and other small business owners, told they faced compulsory purchase orders (CPOs) if they did not relocate to make way for a new commercial and residential masterplan, assumed Spurs were planning to make further fortunes by being centrally involved in the redevelopment.The club’s chairman, Daniel Levy, had emphasised the need for further regeneration in a 2012 joint statement with Haringey council’s then leader, after announcing the club would remain in Tottenham following the failure to beat West Ham to the Olympic Stadium site. But since then, and a memorandum of understanding document agreeing to develop the area together, Spurs and the council have arrived at different visions for the redevelopment. That has infuriated Spurs, who argue the council has erged from the memorandum of understanding, which stated the club would take the lead. Asked about this, a council spokesperson did not disagree, but pointed out the document was not legally binding and left the council free to vary future decisions.The council says its plan was developed after extensive consultation with residents, to have “far-reaching benefits” for the local community: 2,500 new homes – including 191 council homes and 750 classed as “affordable” – new shops, business space and leisure activities, a new public park, square and modern library. Spurs argue the scheme is unambitious, comparing it unfavourably with the prestigious new developments at Kings Cross.A Spurs spokesperson told the : “The club is concerned that the current levels of aspiration for High Road west (centred on a replacement library and district energy centre) fall way short of the council’s own stated objective of creating ‘London’s next premier leisure destination,’ and will not deliver the scale or quality of regeneration the area and local residents deserve.”The council rejects that assessment, saying in response: “The proposals for High Road west reflect the aspirations of those living in the area. The council does not believe that this makes the scheme unambitious.”In 2015, against Spurs’ fundamental opposition, the council took the decision not to entrust the club with the development and held a competitive process to appoint a developer, which resulted in the selection of Lendlease in September 2017.Since then nothing much has happened, which has deepened the insecurity of the small businesses and residents in the Love Lane estate’s 297 homes, still slated for demolition. Outrage among many was sparked by the initial masterplan, which envisaged the whole council estate being knocked down, creating a clear walkway from White Hart Lane train station to Spurs’ gleaming new stadium. Secure council tenants have gradually moved out and been rehoused, so the council has moved in families who were in temporary accommodation, a precarious step up from homelessness. Paul Burnham, of the Haringey Defend Council Housing campaign, believes this is the largest number of people ever moved into housing already scheduled for demolition.Mark Panton, an academic at Birkbeck College who has chronicled the regeneration saga throughout, and with Amanda Lillywhite produced a graphic book “Tottenham’s Trojan Horse?”, hosted Love Lane residents for a day this summer.“There was a real sense of fear,” Panton says. “People are watching the stadium go up, but their homes are due for demolition and they have no idea what the future holds.”Despite the council’s 2015 change of plan Tottenham Hotspur or other Joe Lewis-owned companies have continued to buy more properties on High Road west. In April 2016 a company called Renland Ltd bought a small industrial estate known as the Goods Yard – for £4.05m, according to Land Registry records. Renland is a Spurs company its two directors are Levy and the club’s finance director Matthew Collecott. In turn, the company is owned by Tottenham Developments Ltd, which is not a UK-registered company. The club did not confirm where that company is registered but says the transfers of property to Bahamas-based companies are not being done to avoid UK taxes on capital gains or profits made from developing the sites.In April this year a company called Stanhope Tottenham Ltd bought another large site, on 867-869 High Road west, formerly occupied by the B \u0026amp M supermarket. The price paid was £14.55m. Stanhope Tottenham is a partnership between the developer Stanhope and Spurs companies Levy and Collecott are directors along with three Stanhope executives. Levy and Joe Lewis, who gives his address as Nassau, the Bahamas, are both substantial shareholders.These further property purchases demonstrate that Spurs are digging in for a share in the development and its profits. A club source said they do not believe the council can CPO Spurs’ land because the club will argue they are intending to develop it in the way envisaged in the masterplan. As development has stalled, Spurs have even made their own rival application to the Lendlease plans, to build 330 homes, with retail and leisure outlets, on the Goods Yard site. The council had not responded to it by August and Spurs have appealed against that inaction, a dispute which will be heard by the Planning Inspectorate. The Spurs spokesperson set out the club’s position: “The club remains open to partnership, working with Lendlease or any other developer and the new council administration, and is determined to ensure that the regeneration benefits arising from its investment are maximised for the benefit of the local area.”The council says its plans are subject to more consultation and will change specifically its spokesperson said: “The Love Lane estate is not being demolished to create a walkway to the stadium” and “new council homes at council rents” will be built on the site. The council also says it will aim to relocate some businesses within the new development and help others to move if that is not practical. Following new rules introduced by London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, the council must ballot residents on its plans, a vote due to be held in the spring.Yet the years of delay and dispute have caused many residents and businesses to fear losing out catastrophically. One Love Lane resident, Tash Bonner, 24, a recording artist and music business student at BIMM college, has lived in a Love Lane flat for four years with his mother and younger sister, 19. They ended up homeless, he said, after living in a rented house for 11 years, then in three different temporary addresses, before landing in the Love Lane estate.“It’s been tricky, a lot of insecurity and stress,” Bonner said. “We’ve always lived around here but we’re worried we could be moved out of London, to anywhere. It’s making life harder, it’s very stressful for my Mum there is so much uncertainty.”Faruk Tepeyurt, who runs Solmaz, an interior design company, and represents the businesses on the Peacock industrial estate, believes they are being set up to receive too little money for moving because the masterplan earmarks the site as a green space, not lucrative residential apartments. The old B \u0026amp M site borders DW General Wood Machinists, a thriving 70-year-old family joinery firm which employs 20 people. Its proprietor, Brian Dossett, said it is well known Spurs are buying land in the area but he didn’t understand why, because everybody assumes Spurs will be subject to the same council CPO threat as the small businesses.The past years have been highly stressful, Dossett said, as he faces removal from the area with no replacement site identified: “What else can you be but in limbo?” he said.Reverend Paul Nicolson, a veteran anti-poverty campaigner who lives in the area, has reported the plight of families in the Love Lane estate to the UN Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, describing as “life-crushing” their experience of living in temporary accommodation in London.Famously the Hotspur Football Club was formed in 1882 by young boys from two local schools, who held their inaugural meeting under a streetlight on Tottenham High Road. The Premier League’s newest 21st-century stadium will be a monument to the sport’s phenomenal growth since those beginnings, while condensed around the same High Road are the startling inequalities and complexities of modern-day London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a12d00936cec21657719bc11f1da18692a0cd8a/0_483_2850_1710/master/2850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59ced79a44af28b1b4a10e8442352647","title":"chelsea derby carabao cup match report","story":"There were times when this felt more like a celebration than a cup tie. Those present could rejoice in some encouraging storylines and almost comical subplots just as much as thrill at the wonderfully attacking football delivered by both teams with Frank Lampard, a beaten opposing manager, conducting a post-match lap of the pitch to applaud those supporters who will always count him as one of their own.Chelsea’s all-time record goalscorer has hoisted Premier League trophies in this arena but this occasion, spied from the vantage point of the opposition dugout, still left him brimming with pride.His only regret was elimination, as Maurizio Sarri’s unbeaten Chelsea progressed into a quarter-final against Bournemouth and Lampard aimed his frustration at the award of the home side’s winning goal after Davide Zappacosta’s apparent foul in the build-up.VAR was consulted before Jon Moss awarded that goal, Cesc Fàbregas’s snapshot having flown in via Scott Carson’s left glove with Derby’s players already mustering their protest. Would Lampard depart wondering whether the bigger clubs do, indeed, benefit from fortunate decisions at key times as was suggested so often when he was propelling Chelsea to trophies? “No,” came the response through a smile.There were other elements to this frenzy of a contest which felt unique, not least given Chelsea had 13 of their own players on the pitch throughout after their decision to permit the young loanees Fikayo Tomori and Mason Mount to feature against their parent club.Tomori would end up being taken to one side by David Luiz, the Brazilian offering the England Under-21 defender encouragement given it had been the youngster’s own goal which had edged the home side ahead within the opening five minutes. Slicing in Zappacosta’s cross was not how Tomori had envisaged scoring his first Chelsea goal in front of the Shed End.“But to deal with that and play as he did afterwards, his character was immense,” said Lampard.Yet if a Chelsea player representing Derby and still scoring for Chelsea was a surreal start, then add to that Jack Marriott, a boyhood supporter of the London club, netting the visitors’ swift equaliser. Or Richard Keogh putting through his own net to restore Chelsea’s lead, the third goal Carson had shipped to one of his own team-mates in five days.By the time Martyn Waghorn tapped home to draw Derby level for a second time just before the half-hour, after slick approach play from Mount down the left, the visitors had scored four times and still never been ahead. Indeed, Fàbregas’s shot late in the half was one of Chelsea’s first on target, even as it swelled their goal tally to three.All of which will have left Sarri dissatisfied. Gianfranco Zola bemoaned the slack pace of the team’s passing in that opening period and the panic which set in late on after Álvaro Morata and Gary Cahill, whose slip had presented Marriott with his early chance, had seen Carson deny them breathing space with saves from headers. The last quarter-hour was far too helter-skelter for Chelsea’s comfort as they imposed no control on frantic proceedings. “A lot of that was down to Derby,” said Zola of the opposition from the Championship. “They really played with a lot of quality and surprised us.”But, for all Mount’s elusive approach-play and Marriott’s energy, the third equaliser would not come. David Nugent went closest as full-time approached, wrestling himself beyond Cahill and on to another expertly weighted Tom Huddlestone pass before skimming his shot off the far post with the ball rebounding to a grateful Willy Caballero."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8bb49a8c9d867c452a577a52d8b459908cd8bb0/0_361_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=103da99f0c86f5eb4eba453de0d0674f","title":"chelsea women fiorentina womens champions league match report","story":"• Fran Kirby scores hat-trick in 6-0 triumph in Florence• Chelsea hit woodwork three times in 7-0 aggregate routChelsea stormed into the quarter‑finals of the Women’s Champions League on Wednesday night after a 6-0 win at Fiorentina, with Fran Kirby scoring a hat-trick for the away side to secure a 7-0 aggregate victory.Fiorentina, and in particular their Swedish goalkeeper Stephanie Öhrström, had restricted Emma Hayes’s side to a 1-0 win at home two weeks ago but any fears that the Italian side would cause an upset in the return leg at the Stadio Artemio Franchi were blown away in a dominant display.The London side, in fact, could have won by more as they hit the woodwork three times in the first half an hour. In the end it did not matter. Chelsea can now continue their quest to bring the trophy to England. Chelsea are the only remaining Women’s Super League side in the competition – despite their patchy domestic form – after Manchester City were defeated by Atlético Madrid in the round of 32. Hayes and her players will look forward to the quarter-final draw on 9 November with excitement.There are formidable obstacles still in Chelsea’s path if they want to go all the way – Lyon and Wolfsburg chief among them – but it was a hugely encouraging win for the London club. Kirby’s three goals arrived within 25 minutes on either side of half-time and put the tie out of reach for the Italians. Drew Spence had given Chelsea the lead in the 24th minute while Erin Cuthbert and Ramona Bachmann added the fifth and sixth goals in the second half.The Chelsea defender Millie Bright was sent off with 16 minutes remaining but so dominant were the away side that they still kept a clean sheet, Fiorentina having been sapped of all energy and hope.Apart from Lyon and Wolfsburg – finalists last season – Chelsea will be joined in the last eight by Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and LSK.Barcelona (against Glasgow City) and Slavia Prague (against Rosengård) are expected to complete the lineup on Thursday night having won their first-leg games two weeks ago.Chelsea, who secured the Women’s Super League title last season, will now attempt to maintain the momentum picked up in Florence as they face West Ham United away on Sunday in the league. Chelsea have drawn four of their opening seven games and are 10 points behind Arsenal, having played a game more than the leaders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8509c26e1d4b92f425be54e22af61f7c90c72f55/0_70_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fe7295858f1b021b6b32e33a6ea556e","title":"show us your underwhelming halloween photos","story":"It’s that spooky time of the year again and we’d like to see your efforts – or lack of – taking part in HalloweenWhether you’ve tried and failed to pull off a fancy dress costume, or taken a stab at carving a pumpkin only to be horrified at the embarrassing result, we’d like to see your photos.If you need any inspiration, take a look at our gallery of your underwhelming efforts from last year.You can share your underwhelming Halloween photos with us by filling in the form below.

This included four British newspapers, with the  top – ahead of the Times.The study concluded that while younger readers are highly unlikely to pick up a print newspaper “they often name established newspaper brands as their main source of news”, suggesting younger audiences are seeking out reliable news on websites associated with traditional outlets.The only exception to this rule is the Daily Mail, which has a higher trust rating among older Britons than younger ones.However, the findings of the research – which covered more than 16,114 adults across eight western European countries – also show a deep and growing unhappiness among younger people about how the media covers issues such as crime, as well as growing concerns about media bias.“Younger adults, those aged 18 to 29, largely agree with those older than them that the news media are important to the functioning of society,” said the report’s authors. “But when it comes to how the news media are doing, younger people in many countries are less keen on their performance than older adults.”Young Britons are particularly unhappy with how the British media performs at holding the government to account and how issues around immigration are reported in UK outlets.The research shows older Britons, in common with most western Europeans, continuing to place substantial faith in television news even as young viewers desert that medium.However, the research shows the BBC is used less and trusted less by younger audiences – which the BBC itself acknowledges and which has prompted internal discussions about how to reconnect with this segment of the population.The report finds that most trends in changing media consumption follow the same pattern across Europe, whether in the UK, France or Germany."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0361e7cd1d3d1dc7690f858ccbe13c3c7e107aa/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21a7912849bf8644cfba91207eb45c6d","title":"pop stars burnout ariana grande selena gomez justin bieber","story":"Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber are among the stars using social media to counter industry pressuresOur pop stars are burning out. Ariana Grande, after a hellish year marked by a cancelled engagement, a terror attack and the death of an ex-boyfriend, has hit back at fans angry over the delay to her latest music video: “Been thru hell and back and i’m doing my best to keep going”. Selena Gomez, currently receiving mental health treatment, posted on Instagram: “I am taking a social media break. Again.” Even Rihanna, widely perceived as impervious to industry pressures, became short with an interviewer last month when asked, yet again, when she plans on releasing new music. “Who sent you?” she replied.Why now? The pop industry has never been particularly kind to its artists. Derided as the most commercial (and therefore least serious) music genre, its stars are often regarded less as human beings, more as vessels for bangers. The factory-line churn of having to release an album every two years, with a promotional cycle followed by a world tour – all while maintaining a pleasant, marketable and “always on” public persona – has always been a pressure.Take Britney Spears’ breakdown in 2007, when she shaved her head and attacked a paparazzo’s car with an umbrella: a test case for how the media used to treat a stressed pop idol. Musicians had always “behaved badly”, but for Britney, international pop sensation, this behaviour seemed like a terrible bug in the machine. While bad boys could be bad ­­­­­– that was their brand, after all – the mental breakdown of a picture-perfect young idol was a blatant deviation from the standard script of pop marketability, so reliant on the image of an emotionally uncomplicated and sexually available ingenue. Spears’ erratic behaviour was treated as round-the-clock light entertainment by tabloids, setting a darker precedent: a pop star’s entire personal life is a public commodity.Stars now have tools to fight back, however. Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and Tumblr have become an integral part of the celebrity machine, connecting young, always-online music fans with their favourite stars, bypassing the publicist’s approval. While, to their famous users, social media offer a way out of the well-oiled respectability machine.It’s no coincidence that Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez’s breaks from public life were announced on their social media channels. They are seasoned veterans of the game. In the lead up to her latest album Sweetener, Grande was criticised for not being fully committed to the promotional cycle, with fans noting her absence from the usual roster of American talk shows. Facing mounting criticism, she tweeted that album promotion “destroyed my mental health and was horrible for me”, asking her fans to “stop coming for me and my team when I’ve never been better literally in any department.”Selena Gomez, hot off a major cover story with Elle magazine, voiced her displeasure with the journalist who wrote it on her Instagram, saying: “The older I get the more I want my voice to be mine.” She then hosted a 45-minute Instagram Live stream, in which she discussed her experience of depression, not being mentally ready for touring, and how fame decreases the “pleasure centres” in the brain. “I don’t feel like being on another magazine cover ever again”, she says in the unglamorous, DIY-style video “It just … it doesn’t matter.”While these posts may be a publicist’s nightmare – and irritate the casual observer, familiar with the immense wealth and privilege that comes with this level of celebrity – they strengthen the resolve of the audience that matters most: fans. They flood these posts with uplifting support. “We love u so so much, your happiness is the most important thing to us,” says an Ariana fan in a widely liked comment, responding to her decision to slow down her promotional cycle.“Protecting” your celebrity against public pressures is common among young fans. This curious impulse – perhaps kicked off by Chris Crocker’s exhortation to “Leave Britney alone!” in the wake of her breakdown – blends conventional celebrity fandom with awareness of the corrupting effects of fame. These well-meaning fans’ vociferous concern nevertheless adds to the cacophonous, stressful noise of fame. For pop stars who can endure it, though, this is a game changer. Failure to “work”, rather than being a career killer, has become a unique selling point: disclosing your own struggles in public, and an inability to live up to the fame game, only strengthens your appeal.It would be wrong to suggest that these young stars are fully in control of their lives. In every Instagram post or tweet that pushes back against commercial pressures, there is a naked, vulnerable plea for identification. The spectre of Britney’s breakdown lives on.But it is a start. Pop has always been an industry full of contradictions. It touts the public iconography of young women while being controlled behind the scenes by older men it courts X-rated sexiness while remaining conventionally marketable it emphasises the difference of its artists while pushing them through factory-line production processes. Now, pop is faced with its biggest contradiction yet: the sheer strength of artists’ star power has almost made the media machine behind it irrelevant. Pop stars have long been beholden to their public image, imposed on them from above now, with their social media accounts and steadfast support of their ride-or-die fans, they’re beginning to write their own scripts."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing today in focus","story":"Today in Focus is a new daily podcast that brings you closer to  journalism.

The services deal would give UK companies access to European markets as long as British financial regulation remained broadly aligned with the EU’s, it said.The pound jumped as much as half a percentage point against the dollar following the report.Global banks operating in the UK have had to reorganise their operations around Britain’s departure from the EU, due in March next year. Many have set up new European hubs and begun to move operations, senior executives and staff to ensure they can continue to serve their continental clients if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal.According to the Times report, EU will accept that the UK has “equivalent” regulations to Brussels, and UK financial services companies will be allowed to operate as they now do in Europe.EU officials have said the EU’s financial market access system, known as “equivalence”, under which Brussels grants access to foreign banks and insurers if their home rules converge with the bloc’s, is probably Britain’s best bet.“Equivalence” has so far had limited application because, under existing rules, market access can be withdrawn unilaterally with only a month’s notice, the Times said.Under the new deal, “equivalence” would be extended and fall under the governance of the wider trade treaty, allowing the EU and the UK to change or set new financial regulations after consulting each other beforehand, it was reported.May’s principal Europe adviser, Oliver Robbins, is continuing the negotiations in Brussels, according to the report.With five months to secure a deal before Britain is due to leave the EU, business leaders are demanding certainty over the kind of trade terms the orce will deliver.UK’s Financial Conduct Authority wants Britain to stay closely aligned with the EU, but without Britain’s having to copy all the bloc’s rules, the acting director of strategy at the FCA, Richard Monks, has said.Britain on Wednesday said there was no set date for Brexit talks to finish, backtracking from a letter by Brexit minister Dominic Raab that suggested a deal on the terms of its departure from the European Union could be finalised by 21 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc5f61ae66dd5ec3c1560ba08395d68650f9256e/0_277_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73c221873734b318814a09667d819721","title":"preston named as most most improved city in uk","story":"Labour-run council with localist economic policies tops Good Growth for Cities index Preston, the Lancastrian city labelled as a poster child for “Corbynomics,” has been named as the most rapidly improving urban area in the UK to live and work.Research carried out by the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and the thinktank Demos, which used a range of measures including employment, workers’ pay, house prices, transport, the environment, work-life-balance and inequality to rank 42 UK cities, found that Preston had improved the most in its 2018 Good Growth for Cities index.It said the city was better to live in than London on the index, which attempts to assess the quality of life in cities across Britain beyond traditional economic measures such as gross domestic product.The city in recent years has gained national attention for the way its Labour-run council has adopted an ultra-localist approach to economic policy. In an attempt to revitalise the local economy following the last recession, it attempted to encourage “anchor institutions” – such as the council, police, colleges and the university – to buy the goods and services they need from local businesses wherever possible.Although this predated the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, the lessons from the city have become central to the party’s economic thinking. It featured in a pamphlet on alternative models of ownership commissioned by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and has been described by the Economist magazine as the “poster child of Corbynomics”.Although the PwC and Demos report did not refer to the council’s localist economic policy as one of the reasons for the city’s recent revival, it may have helped it to rise up the rankings.Jonathan House, an author of the report at PwC, said: “It’s definitely a combination of the public and local private sector, providing the context for this good growth to take place. Some of the policy and business decisions have led to this improvement.”Matthew Brown, the leader of Preston city council, said the improvement in the ranking showed the success of “practical policies to build wealth for the whole community collaboratively with a number of partners”.He added: “We are proud to receive national recognition for the improvement in these areas that has been made in the city in the last 12 months.”Preston ranked 14th in the best cities list, ahead of London in 15th, with the capital held back by high housing and transport costs and higher inequality.

The 21st November was the date offered by the Chair of the Select Committee for the Secretary of State to give evidence.”Downing Street sources are still indicating in private they hope the Brexit talks will be concluded in November, although the two sides are yet to agree on the appropriate backstop to ensure a free-flowing land border in Ireland and how that backstop could be wound up.The UK wants the EU to agree to drop the Northern Ireland-only backstop in favour of allowing the entire UK to remain in a country-wide “temporary customs arrangement” with the 27-country bloc if no free trade deal can be concluded by the time the transition period ends in December 2020.Once a deal is deemed near to completion by officials from the UK and the European Union, a special European summit will be convened to reach an agreement. It will then have to be ratified by MPs, although it continues to be unclear if Theresa May will be able to force her deal through parliament.Others are hoping to propose alternatives to May’s final deal in the Commons, although the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told MPs that the government could ignore the result of votes passed unless they were carried as amendments. Natzler said “there’s not statutory obligation” for May to act if MPs were to vote in a motion for a second referendum.Shortly after the Raab letter emerged, EU ambassadors for the 27 member states were told on Wednesday that “nothing new” had emerged from recent contacts with Downing Street’s Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins.Sabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, told diplomats that they are in the “final stretch on the backstop talks” and “nothing has changed, there are no new ideas”. One EU diplomat added: “The negotiations are around the same concept.”The EU is continuing to insist that the Northern Ireland specific backstop, under which the province could remain in the single market and customs union, must stay in the withdrawal agreement, even if there is also a commitment to negotiate an all-UK customs union during the transition period.The prime minister has repeatedly said that this would be unacceptable. By contrast, Raab’s letter to the select committee suggested that EU has accepted the idea of the temporary customs arrangement. “We agree on the principle of a UK-wide customs backstop,” the Brexit secretary wrote.On Wednesday afternoon May addressed around 150 chairs and chief executives of UK businesses and business group leaders about progress in the Brexit negotiations and Monday’s budget, and sought to encourage them to support whatever deal she brings back from Brussels.A European commission spokesman declined to comment on the next steps in the talks, only confirming that “contacts continue on a technical level”.Ireland’s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said it was still possible that a Brexit deal could be done by 21 November but it would mean the British team removing “the remaining barrier” over the Irish backstop. He said that he had “frank and very long discussions” with the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, on Wednesday morning and the Brexit secretary on Tuesday night.“I think it is possible to get a deal in November, he said. But he warned there would “not be a new EU leaders’ summit on Brexit if there is not a signal from the negotiating teams that there is something for EU leaders to sign off on.”He said that if an emergency EU summit was to go ahead in mid-November, “a signal would need to come from the negotiating teams next week to be able to put the machinery in place for an EU summit in November”.Earlier, senior EU officials had said that if Raab’s timescale was real it would have required an “urgent” breakthrough on the backstop issue, with an agreement on paper well ahead of any Brexit summit in the middle of November.EU sources added, however, that the timings were tight and the UK government needed to be realistic about the period that would be needed for the heads of state and government to assess the situation ahead of a crunch summit. The two negotiating teams are due to go into “the tunnel” of confidential talks next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/954f53e2b355a2f774f5e58658b346886b04a56f/0_20_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d1989aa6d1181c1084bf89e5148e34f","title":"babies born to older fathers tend to have more medical issues","story":"Men who start families later in life should be aware of the potential health risks to their children, study saysMen who start families later in life should be aware of the potential health risks to their children, according to US doctors who found that babies born to older fathers tend to have more medical issues than those born to younger men.Michael Eisenberg, a senior author on the report, said that while the increased risks were modest, couples should not ignore the father’s age when it came to family planning. “This is something else to take into consideration,” he said. “There are potential risks with waiting. Men should not think that they have an unlimited runway.”But Eisenberg stressed that the increased risks for iniduals were small. After adjusting for the mother’s age and other factors such as education and whether she smoked, he found that children born to men aged 45 and over were born less than a day earlier on average, and weighed only 20g lighter (just over half an ounce) than those with younger fathers.More important, said Eisenberg, was the impact modest increases in health risks might have across populations as paternal age continues to rise. In England and Wales, the average age of first-time fathers has risen about a year per decade for the past 40 years, according to the Office of National Statistics.Eisenberg and his colleagues suggest changes in the DNA of older men’s sperm might explain their findings. The concern is backed up by previous work, including a Harvard study last year that found births through IVF fell as the fathers’ age increased.In a commentary accompanying the BMJ study, Hilary Brown, a perinatal epidemiologist at the University of Toronto in Scarborough, cautioned that despite the researchers’ efforts, it was hard to disentangle the effects of the mother’s and father’s ages. And she warned that damage to DNA in older mens’ sperm was only one possible explanation for the effects. “Studies have shown that advanced paternal age is associated with negative health behaviours such as smoking and frequent alcohol consumption, obesity, chronic disease, mental illness, and sub-fertility,” she writes, adding that all are linked to health problems in newborns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcf4a5bdc6b5d02afe3fd6f82bd26b58c841f95e/0_380_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1744e794acc4430ea14dbf00e0277055","title":"its important to feel connected companies share their co working experiences","story":"Achieving a true work-life balance is notoriously difficult, whether you’re a working parent, first-time entrepreneur or a senior business leader.

By Jake AndersonOne morning back in May 2016, my wife and I had a visit from a nurse, who had come to the house to discuss our daughter, Alice. We made coffee, put biscuits on a plate and sat around the kitchen table.“So,” said the woman, who was part of the local community learning disabilities team, “how can I help you?”My wife and I exchanged weary glances. We had lost count of the health professionals who had asked this very question. But perhaps it was going to be different this time. Our visitor was young and bright-eyed. Would she be the one to finally give us the support we needed? We started telling our story all over again.It began in 2003, when we adopted Alice, then four months old. For those first few years, you would have described her as determined, boisterous and noisy. In July 2006, we moved from Cambridge to the West Country, and everything changed. Alice would wake in the middle of the night and scream for hours on end. A new problem emerged when she started at the village primary school. She would wake up every morning in a state of high anxiety. If we asked her to put on any item of clothing that she found too tight, too itchy or the wrong design, she refused to get dressed. At one time, she would only ever wear knickers with a panda design on – when BHS stopped stocking them, I had to buy an indelible marker and draw the designs on myself. Many children do this at some stage, but Alice’s difficulties with clothing were prolonged and extreme by any measure.Some days, we would make it out of the door to walk to school, only for Alice to turn around and run home, go back in the house and lock us out. Only a visit from the headteacher, who would dash around the corner from school, would persuade her to come out. After school, Alice was agitated, hyperactive and difficult to control. She refused to go anywhere in the car. When we finally got her into the car, she could become angry and violent. Or she would simply remove her seatbelt.Alice could not settle at night, which meant one of us had to stay with her until she fell asleep. It often took hours. Hours of reading the same Horrid Henry stories or watching a film we had already seen dozens of times, which she found comforting. Such bedtime rituals are not uncommon with children, but this was the norm every night, throughout her primary school years, and beyond.We sought help from the GP, who referred Alice to a paediatrician. Following an assessment in October 2010, when she was seven, we were told she had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), foetal alcohol syndrome, auditory processing difficulties and pervasive developmental disorder (a diagnosis that acknowledged Alice had some autistic traits, but not enough to be described as autism spectrum disorder). We experienced a mix of shock and relief. Perhaps now we would get some help. But again and again, we came up against the same problem. If we managed to reach the head of a long waiting list and had Alice assessed for support, we discovered that there was none on offer.My wife is an occupational therapist who works with adults with disabilities. She understands much of the terminology used by services, and is a dab hand at filling in the long-winded forms. I am a psychotherapist, so I recognise some, if not all, of the phraseology used. I am also freelance and can therefore be more flexible than many parents who work full time, when it comes to attending appointments. But even with this head start, we were really struggling to get any support. For Alice’s sake, and for ours, we desperately needed someone who could help her to communicate her frustrations and help us develop effective strategies.The coffee and biscuits had all gone by the time we finished our story. The nurse from the community disability team had written copious notes. She looked up from her pad and smiled. “This must have been so difficult for you.” My wife welled up. We were both exhausted by Alice’s obstructive behaviour, by sleep deprivation and worry. When she wasn’t agitated or angry, Alice was a loving, funny girl who had friends. But she was now so often stressed that her anxiety was close to consuming her – and the rest of us.I will never forget the nurse’s parting words. “I won’t let you down. I promise to get you the support you need.”Two weeks later, a letter arrived. The nurse said she had spoken to her manager, and she regretted that Alice did not fit their criteria. Alice had specific learning difficulties, not learning disabilities, and therefore they were closing her file.Given that we had been referred to her department, this was not only disappointing, but also confusing. We were learning about these opaque definitions as we went along, but the nurse was supposedly an expert. So why had they assessed us if they knew we were never going to qualify for help?Yet another service had dangled the promise of support, only to whip it away. By now, beaten down by the system, we had come to the conclusion that children’s services, within both education and health, were impenetrable to families like us. The dense forms and long waiting lists amounted to a cruel bureaucratic wall built to keep people out. When we were assessed, we would almost always be discharged straight after. Which made us think: if a system exists to assess but never to provide intervention, then surely it is not a functioning system. It is merely the appearance of one.We constantly asked ourselves why. The only conclusion we could draw was that it was a funding issue. Providing therapy requires expertise and time. If we – and others like us – could be prevented from accessing support, then we would not become a cost burden.Alice has special educational needs. The Department of Education states that, as of January 2018, there are 1,276,215 children in the UK who can be described this way. That number has risen since 2017, although this doesn’t in any way provide a full picture. It is harder than ever before to get your child assessed for special educational needs, so the true figure is likely to be higher. Even with a diagnosis, because council budgets have been brutally slashed, it is hard to get support.According to Renata Blower, a director of the Special Needs Jungle, an information resource that helps families navigate services for children like Alice, there has never been a greater demand for support and knowledge. “Our website now receives around 200,000 hits a month – more than ever before,” Blower said.Families who struggle every day with children who are anxious, hyperactive, obstructive and at times deeply unhappy, come up against a wall again and again. The system that should be helping them appears to be channelling all its energies into preventing families from accessing support.Under the stairs in our house there are two bulging box files, containing the paperwork relating to Alice. Looking through the documents, the same pattern – of services batting us away – is painfully evident.The one exception was in August 2011, when Alice was nine. That was the year we secured her statement of special educational needs. A statement – or education, health and care plan as it is now known – is a legally binding document that sets out what extra provision a child with special educational needs has a right to.For the parent of a child like Alice, for whom school is a source of huge anxiety, a statement is a passport that should guarantee support throughout the school years. Today, they are incredibly hard to obtain. We set out to get a statement for Alice when it was clear she was struggling at school, not simply because of her ADHD and auditory processing difficulties, but because of suspected dyslexia. Through the headteacher, we requested a statutory assessment (a full investigation carried out by a local authority educational psychologist) of Alice’s educational needs. The process is free and, if I remember correctly, took about a year. Following the assessment, the local authority confirmed that her problems did merit extra support – and a statement detailing what she was entitled to, both within the classroom and through other services, was issued.The document said she needed four days a week of close support at school. It quickly became clear this wasn’t going to happen. Alice’s overstretched teaching assistant was often asked to look after another child with learning difficulties, in addition to covering the school’s front desk. I should add that although we live in the countryside, our village is not cut off. We are just 30 minutes from a city, and close to good road and rail links. What I am trying to say is, the school could without doubt have found iniduals to do the work, but they didn’t have the money to pay them. Alice had a statement setting out measures the local authority was legally bound to provide, but austerity was making a mockery of it.The speech and language service in our area is run by Virgin Care, now one of the UK’s largest private providers of healthcare. Virgin Care has accumulated almost £2bn of NHS contracts over the past five years, although precise details of what children’s services they run are hard to find because neither the Department of Health and Social Care nor NHS England keep centralised records.Following an assessment in November 2013, we received a letter from Virgin Care. We found it baffling. It read: “As Alice’s language skills are delayed but in line with each other, her needs can be best met within the school environment and her case is now closed.”My wife attempted to translate for me: Alice was significantly behind in her cognitive development. Not only did this diagnosis feel incorrect, but also, for reasons that were never fully explained, it absolved Virgin Care of any duty of care and handed the responsibility over to Alice’s school. This seemed utterly ridiculous, not least because the letter then detailed all the specialist strategies that Alice’s teaching assistant was obliged to deliver.By December 2013, when Alice (then 11), was in year 6, we could no longer ignore the problems. Her reading levels were four years behind her peers. We had asked repeatedly that the teaching assistant be allowed to do her job, rather than be constantly pulled away to work elsewhere. Again and again, Alice, very distressed, told us that she got no support in lessons and felt completely lost. Eventually we cracked and had her transferred to a larger, better-resourced school. Disruptive though this change was, for the final year of her primary education, Alice at last received the dedicated support her statement demanded, and her test scores improved dramatically.It was a rare moment of triumph. Our social worker from the post-adoption team would visit once a year. She was always sympathetic, but made it very clear how strapped for cash her department was – and indeed how worn down by the system she was.The post-adoption team did find us places on a parenting course early in 2014, aimed at helping frazzled couples like us acquire the skills we needed to manage our children’s challenging behaviour. Delivered by a wise, empathetic psychologist, it was insightful, sometimes revelatory stuff. But given that our lives had already been consumed by a quest for support, the 12-week course, delivered every Monday in a town an hour from home, often felt like another sap on our depleted energy and time. We needed specialist support, not to become the specialists. It was also harrowing. Hearing the stories of other adopters, many attempting to cope with situations just like ours, was traumatic.By the time Alice started at secondary school in September 2014, she had received just four hours of therapeutic support in total (in the form of strategies to calm her down). She was more anxious than ever. In addition to obstructive behaviour and sleep difficulties, she had also developed a head tic – jerking of the neck, caused by stress. In 2015, we approached our GP again, asking for a referral to the child and adolescent mental health service (Camhs) for help with her anxiety. Camhs, which offers counselling and other psychological support across the UK, is run in our area by Virgin Care.After sitting on a waiting list for more than six months, we were offered an assessment in February 2016. We were seen by a kindly psychotherapist, who listened carefully to our concerns, taking time to hear Alice’s perspective, even as she squirmed under the spotlight. We dared hope that, finally, some meaningful help might be provided. A week or so later, a letter informed us that Alice was to be offered therapeutic support.On our return visit to Camhs for a follow-up appointment a few weeks later, we were astounded to hear that there had been a change of decision. Alice was now ineligible for support. Without a diagnosis of autism or psychosis, she would not be offered help. So Alice’s symptoms were considered serious enough for her to be placed on a waiting list, but not serious enough to be treated. Instead, she was referred on to the community learning disabilities team for assessment. This was how we ended up sitting at the kitchen table with the nurse in May 2016.Once again, support had come tantalisingly close, only to be withdrawn. Our local Camhs boasts a team of child psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, cognitive behavioural therapists, child psychotherapists, occupational therapists and many more skilled professionals besides. Yet its real expertise appeared to lie in finding ways they couldn’t help, rather than ways they could.In 2016, we embarked on our most gruelling fight yet, over schooling. Alice, now 13, was in year 8 of mainstream state secondary education. She was in classes of up to 30 children, where she barely understood anything beyond the teacher’s opening sentences. Despite her very clear statement of special educational needs, she received no one-to-one support with her reading and, within lessons, only sporadic one-to-one support from helpers with no specialist dyslexia or speech and language training. She was also being bullied.At the end of a day in this terrifying place, Alice got home hyperactive, angry and frustrated. In addition to the head tics, she now suffered from severe stomach pains and dizziness. Her disquiet would peak before bed. Aged 13, she still needed one of us to lie with her, soothing and calming her, before she eventually dropped off (also aided by melatonin).We had chosen Alice’s secondary school, which was not close to home, because it had a respected special educational needs department. But things were getting worse. We urgently needed to find somewhere that was far more focused on her specific needs – a school that would actually deliver the provision in her statement.At Alice’s annual review in May 2016, we asked that she be transferred to Mark College, a specialist dyslexia school. Our local authority resisted – placing Alice in independent education would cost them more, after all – so we requested the opportunity to appeal at a special educational needs and disability (Send) tribunal. This tribunal, where the decision lies in the hands of an independent judge, has the power to order local authorities to change its decisions.Preparing for a tribunal means employing a specialist education lawyer, as well as commissioning reports from a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist and an educational psychologist, some or all of whom are expected to attend court. It all comes at a huge cost – over £18,000 in our case.It was more than just a financial drain. Our energy and morale were at rock bottom. We were facing a court case simply to secure our daughter the support that should have been hers five years before, when her needs were first diagnosed and the statement was issued.Our lawyer assured us that, while there were no guarantees, Alice’s case was strong. However, what should have been a straightforward process was anything but. Our educational psychologist issued his report (one that would be used as evidence in the tribunal) on 11 June 2016. Shortly after, we received notification from the local authority that our tribunal date would be 17 January 2017. An educational psychology report is valid for six months. The tribunal date meant we had to get our report renewed – at the cost of £1,500. What is more, the speech and language therapist and occupational therapist we had commissioned said that when they attempted to assess Alice in school, they felt they were obstructed. They spoke of difficulties making appointments, and had got the impression that their visits were seen as an unnecessary and irritating interference. We began to wonder whether something else was going on.Our lawyer was convinced these were deliberate tactics on behalf of the local authority – tactics that he had encountered with other clients throughout the UK – all designed to obstruct or delay the process and wear parents down to the point where they throw in the towel. We have no way of proving his theory. It would be nice to think that such dark scheming does not go on. But given what we had experienced over the years, it doesn’t seem beyond the realms of possibility.On the day of our tribunal in January 2017, it quickly became clear the judge was leaning in our favour. His sighs and raised eyebrows suggested that he was aghast at the county’s flaky experts, flimsy evidence and unsubstantiated promises of support. Two weeks later, we got our decision: Alice was heading to a specialist school. The £18,000 legal costs had been worth it – she was finally going to get the help she so desperately needed.In February 2017, Alice began at Mark College. The school is run by the Priory Group, better known as the provider of alcohol and drug rehabilitation programmes. Priory is owned by Acadia, a US healthcare provider, which paid £1.28bn for the group in 2016.The week after Alice started, Mark College received an Ofsted report that rated the school as inadequate. We were utterly horrified, and met with the head. The rating did not tell the whole story, he said. With a specialist school, there were many more processes and procedures to be inspected. It was all too easy to trip up on a single missing certificate or piece of paperwork – nothing they couldn’t remedy by the next inspection.We were reassured. Before long, we saw huge changes in Alice. She was weekly boarding – a massive step for her – but had settled in well. In contrast to her days being bullied at the state secondary, she was popular. She forged a deep bond with her tutor, who was committed to improving her self-esteem and communication skills. This, combined with the homely environment, small classes and guarantee of therapy in line with Alice’s statement, seemed like a dream come true.It turned out, unfortunately, that it was a dream. In December 2017, the school received a second inadequate Ofsted rating. We took a long, hard look at the paperwork this time. The report drew particular attention to the safety and welfare of boarders.A new head was appointed, but by now, other issues were worrying us. As of 5 March 2018, more than a year since she had started at Mark College, Alice had only received two sessions of occupational therapy, despite the fact that her statement specified a session every week. Alice told us of one class, with just two pupils, in which the teacher had effectively given up on her, letting her play on her phone while he devoted his energies to the other child in the room.We met with the new head, who promised to look at our concerns. For a few weeks, Alice did receive occupational therapy, although this progress was soon to be dramatically derailed. In June 2018, the head rang to tell us that the residential provision would be closing at the end of term, just four weeks away. He explained that, despite their best efforts, the boarding standards demanded by Ofsted had not been met and, as another inspection was imminent, there was a very real danger of another inadequate rating, and the school closing. In other words, they had decided to sacrifice the residential provision to save the school.A spokesperson for Mark College said: “The decision to move to day placements only was a difficult one, but made in the best interests of the pupils and the longer term sustainability of the school … A strong, new leadership team is now in place and rapid improvements have been made.”Alice was halfway through her GCSE courses when we received the news. She was devastated. We had finally found a school where she felt at home. And she was terrified of the changes to come. The distance – it was two hours’ drive away – meant staying as a day pupil was not an option. As most specialist schools were closing for the summer holidays, we began a frantic search for a new school. We seemed to spend whole days going up and down the M5 just as a heatwave took hold, stress levels so high it was impossible to calmly assess what was on offer.We finally found a new specialist school. Alice spent the summer hugely apprehensive about starting. She is, at the time of writing, beginning to settle, but it is still early days.In the midst of all this, we had some very significant news. Back in Alice’s primary school days, our paediatrician referred her to the local autism assessment team. We had long known she had autistic traits – including anxiety around transition or changes in routine – but had attempted to understand those behaviours within the context of her vague diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder. Our referral repeatedly got lost in the system and, over the years, we pushed again and again for an assessment. Finally, in May 2016, eight years after our first request, our local autism service (run, you guessed it, by Virgin Care) confirmed that we were on the waiting list.It took another 18 months before she was formally assessed. We then waited until December 2017 before we finally received confirmation that Alice had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It explained so much. How helpful would it have been to know this 10 years ago, when we first requested an assessment. We would have understood the causes of Alice’s stress and might – just might – have been able to secure support from our local mental health service.With the school issue settled and Alice’s autism spectrum disorder diagnosis finally confirmed, we feel we can take a breath. And as we do, we can’t help reflecting on the system’s many flaws. Many of the teams involved in Alice’s case – speech and language, occupational therapy, post-adoption – work in the same building in our local city, all part of what is optimistically known as integrated children’s services. In our county, this is run by Virgin Care. On its website, the integrated children’s service says it aims “to provide a joined-up service to make sure you have all information and care you need”. But in our experience, none of the teams seemed to ever share information or talk to each other, let alone provide care in a coordinated manner.Confusing forms, soul-sapping waiting lists and a continual redrawing of the lines: these add up to obstruction, to the feeling that agencies do not want to help. On the few occasions when we succeeded in winning support from the state, it has been down to our collective expertise and persistence. So what hope is there for couples without our resources, or for a single parent coping on their own?The one obvious benefit of preventing people from accessing services is that it saves the government the expense of paying for support and therapy. In 2014, the government conducted a major overhaul of the way special educational needs are supported. Part of the Children and Families Act, the changes were designed to put children and their parents at the centre of discussions about the support on offer. But as a spokesperson at the National Autistic Society says: “Carrying out wholesale reforms at a time when council budgets have been slashed was never going to work well.”The autistic society’s report, Autism and Education in England 2017, talks of long waits for support to be provided in school, refusal by local authorities to carry out assessments, and failure of local services to work together to meet children’s needs. It describes a system starved of investment and broken as a result.If care-providers continue to fail to diagnose and support children with autism and other learning difficulties, those children are liable to develop multiple problems, anxiety in particular. Marianna Murin, a principal clinical psychologist who managed psychology provision at the National Centre for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Great Ormond Street hospital for more than a decade, talks of alarming rates of mental health problems in this group.And what of the families? Renata Blower, who has spoken to hundreds of parents, said the damage caused by failure to diagnose and support autism in children is “immense”. “It ruptures marriages, causes breakdowns,” she said.A spokesperson for Virgin Care said: “It was widely acknowledged that these services needed improving when Virgin Care took them on in April 2013 and much of these issues relate to the service many years ago. Over the last five years we have worked hard to deliver what we promised: more joined-up services, reduced waiting times and more support for parents.”Many of the recent problems, they said, have arisen from “incredible increases in demand”. The company says that it ploughs profits back into making the improvements recommended by commissioners, and meeting this increase.For change to happen, there has to be a genuine desire within government to help, and that is missing. Schools must be adequately funded so they can provide the help set out in education, health and care plans. Support should not be withheld to save money, but offered open-handedly, for as long as it is necessary. And cases like Alice’s should be managed by a single person, who can marshal the teams involved and make sure everyone shares the same information.Alice is now 16. When she is not consumed by anxiety, she is a loving, affectionate girl with a wonderful sense of humour and a contagious laugh. She is also a skilled cook, who can effortlessly knock up perfect cakes, or her signature dish, risotto with butternut squash and feta cheese. She works weekends in a busy local pub, where she assists the chef with food prep. She has a handful of kind, patient friends who understand her difficulties.In common with other girls with autism spectrum disorder, she has learned to mask her many difficulties. But underneath the cheery surface that the outside world sees is a vulnerable teenager who still struggles to make sense of non-verbal cues, as well as many written and spoken words who finds change exceedingly stressful. Thankfully, Alice is also tough and fiercely determined. Given all that is ranged against her, it is just as well.The names of the author and his daughter have been changed• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3e9eeb82faf3562d1864df20ac22edc2dfcf4ac/0_97_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87cb6ffa7c0d872108bc56aa210c10dc","title":"subsidised tenants are excluded from pool and gym in london tower","story":" Residents in affordable homes at Royal Wharf in Newham say they are victims of segregationAffordable housing residents in a new enclave of 3,400 homes are being prevented from using a luxury swimming pool and gymnasium, which are being kept for the exclusive use of private owners and renters.Residents paying taxpayer-subsidised rents at Royal Wharf in the London borough of Newham have complained they are victims of segregation because they will not have access to a state-of-the-art clubhouse that neighbours who own or rent privately will enjoy.Up to about 500 residents are affected and some have branded the decision unfair because it appeared to discriminate against them because they were less well-off than the other people at the estate.Residents who live at Royal Wharf under the mayor’s London living rent arrangement only qualify for homes if they are already renting and have a household income of less than £60,000 a year. Priority is given to families with children and people who live or work in Newham, which has some of the highest levels of deprivation in the country. It is supported by a £6.7m subsidy.Marketing materials for properties for sale on the estate had described the swimming and hydrotherapy pools, sauna, steam room and gym as “a perfect platform for bringing people together”. But the landlord, L\u0026ampQ, a housing charity, has said its tenants will not have access to the facility and Ballymore, the developer, said they will not be able to buy inidual memberships.Ade Eros, 37, a father of two who moved into a three-bedroom flat this summer, said it was wrong. “We don’t know why we are being segregated,” he said. “Whatever the reason for the policy, it is not fair. They should be motivated to include everyone.”He said it was “sad because we were looking forward to using it with my two boys and them learning to swim”.Another resident, who asked not to be named, said it was “like social cleansing”.“We’re the poor relations,” she said. “It’s really unfair.”Another complained that he was having to use a gym a couple of miles away in Canary Wharf.Leaseholders, on the other hand, will get free access to the clubhouse which opens in December, which also has a “technogym” staffed by personal trainers running courses in Zumba, yoga and pilates. Tenants of private flats will only have to pay about £45 to join.The deputy mayor of London, James Murray, said: “It would be plain wrong if residents in the London living rent homes were not able to access memberships to the leisure facilities when they open. We will contact Ballymore’s senior management to make clear our expectation that these facilities must be available to all residents.”The arrangement emerged after widespread concern at social housing residents being forced to use side doors to apartment blocks that also contain private flats, a phenomenon being dubbed “poor doors”.Planning policy has encouraged affordable and private housing to be blended so that they look similar, but city flat dwellers have found that even bicycle storage spaces, rubbish disposal facilities and postal deliveries are being separated.A spokeswoman for L\u0026ampQ said: “It is policy not to pay for universal access to extras such as a clubhouse as not everyone would use this amenity and it does not provide value for money. Royal Wharf is no exception and we marketed the properties on the basis that access to the clubhouse was not included.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e2e57200c7d31c88c598305cdeb5c21efef36b/0_215_6333_3800/master/6333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8178c3b8fc24b2d66ab235b0404322d","title":"record number of people are sleeping rough in london","story":"Charities say ‘appalling’ surge in homelessness caused by lack of affordable housingA record number of people are sleeping rough in London, with charities reporting a spike in street homelessness.Figures show that 3,103 people were found sleeping rough in the capital between July and September 2018 – the first time the total has exceeded 3,000 in a three-month period. Charities attributed the surge to a lack of affordable housing.Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of the charity Crisis, said: “This appalling spike in the number of people forced to sleep rough in London is a disaster for every single person experiencing life on the streets. Across the capital, local authorities are struggling with increasing numbers of people new to the streets, which is why the root cause of the problem must be tackled.“We cannot carry on like this when we know homelessness is not inevitable. We don’t have have enough affordable housing that homeless people can access.”Homeless Link’s chief executive, Rick Henderson, said: “It is alarming to see such a dramatic rise in the number of people sleeping rough in London … We need to ask ourselves some tough questions about why so many are finding themselves with little choice but to bed down on the streets.”Research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found more than 440 homeless people died on streets or in temporary accommodation in the UK in the past year. Among those who died since October 2017 was a former solider, an astrophysicist and a Big Issue seller.Charities have called the deaths a national disgrace and blamed soaring homelessness on austerity, expensive private rents and a lack of social housing. They said local authorities should investigate every death.The figures are likely to be a substantial underestimate as no official organisation counts the deaths of homeless people in Britain. Data shows there were at least 449 deaths in a year – more than one per day.An investigation by the  in April found that at least 230 deaths of homeless people were recorded by local authorities in the UK between 2013 and 2017.Responding to the London figures, the minister for housing and homelessness, Heather Wheeler, said: “We have set out bold plans backed by £100m to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and end it by 2027, as part of a £1.2bn investment in tackling all forms of homelessness.“We are also working closely with London boroughs and the Greater London Authority and are providing them with £23.3m through our Rough Sleeping Initiative. With this funding, we are looking to them to deliver critical support to get people off the streets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30b1b5f6be4b7cf97aee8d5d0a95d2417b3e7754/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8c81e56ee21c273b6f71f11c9055279","title":"david peever resigns as cricket australia chairman","story":"Decision comes after days of turmoil following damning report into the state of the national sportSeven months on from the ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town, another victim has been claimed after the Cricket Australia chairman, David Peever, tendered his resignation in the wake of a damning review into the organisation’s culture.Following an extraordinary board meeting on Thursday afternoon, Peever fell on his sword after calls from the states for him to stand down effectively made his position untenable. Earl Eddings, the deputy chairman, was appointed as the interim chair.“We look forward to continuing the important process of recovering and rebuilding for Cricket Australia and Australian cricket,” Eddings said in a statement. “The board is keenly aware that we have a way to go to earn back the trust of the cricket community. We and the executive team are determined to make cricket stronger.”Pressure had been mounting on Peever since the findings of the report, undertaken by the Ethics Centre, were made public on Monday. It found CA to have been “controlling” and “arrogant”, and allowed a win-at-all-costs mentality to develop that culminated in the on-field events at Newlands earlier this year.Peever was unanimously re-elected to his position for another term of three years at last Thursday’s AGM, just days before the report was released to the public. The states that voted him in for a second term had not seen the report at the time and afterwards expressed their concern.In responding to the findings of the report on Monday, Peever said he served cricket with “a feeling of great privilege and responsibility” and was adamant he would not stand down.“I’m not embarrassed at all ... we’re very committed to moving the game forward and using this review as a platform to do that,” he said. “We didn’t put sufficient emphasis on the spirit of the game in our pursuit of wanting to be the very best we could on the field.“That’s been recognised and we’re using the report now as an opportunity to do better.”But he came under intense fire in the days that followed, notably from former Test captain Ian Chappell and former CA chief executive Malcolm Speed, the latter who took exception to Peever’s assertion in an interview that the cheating scandal was a “hiccup”.The scandal had already cost Darren Lehmann his position as coach, while Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft are all currently serving bans.Further upheaval came with the retirement of the CA chief executive, James Sutherland, two months after Cape Town, and high performance manager Pat Howard has also announced he will move on, after the 2019 Ashes series.The board will reconvene in the coming weeks to discuss the appointment of a permanent replacement for Peever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fefb38ca382efc915adb770d6fd6ee32f8e488a/0_154_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92f433740eac38e19971117ceafbb536","title":"chris froome declines to commit to defending giro d italia title in 2019 team sky cycling","story":"• Team Sky rider undecided following announcement of route• Decision rests partly on Froome’s desire to win Tour de FranceThe Giro d’Italia champion Chris Froome said he is still undecided about riding in next year’s edition but added that the start of the 102nd route, announced on Wednesday, looked explosive.The Team Sky rider became the first Briton to win the century-old race in May, and was briefly the first cyclist in 35 years to hold all three Grand Tour titles at the same time.He relinquished that when he finished behind his Sky teammate Geraint Thomas in the 2018 Tour de France and then did not race in the Vuelta a España which was won by compatriot Simon Yates, who had led most of the Giro before Froome’s win.Froome was one of the main guests at the 2019 Giro route presentation in Milan on Wednesday. But he was unsure about whether he would be on the start line in Bologna on 11 May where a short and sharp 8.2km time trial kicks off the race.“I still don’t know. It’s a decision that we’ll have to take with the team,” Froome said. “With a hard start like that it’s going to be very explosive, very interesting.”After the time trial, stage two takes the riders from Bologna to Fucecchio. The riders will then head to the west coast from Vinci to Orbetello, before twisting through the shallow inclines of central Italy.Italy’s Elia Viviani, who won the points classification in this year’s race, predicted a fast opening week in 2019. “A sprinter who arrives in good shape could get a good haul of stage wins from that first week,” he said.There will also be another inidual time trial on stage nine over an ever-rising 34.7km from Riccione to San Marino. Riders get a respite on stage 10’s flat 147km route from Ravenna to Modena, with the next day starting from Carpi.The race winner will probably be decided on one of the three Dolomite climbs on stage 20, before the final stage in Verona, a 15.6km time trial. The winner will be crowned inside the city’s Roman amphitheatre.Team Sky will have a decision to make on who they send to the 3,518km event in Italy with Thomas considering returning to the race which he crashed out of in 2017. “The Giro really excites me. It feels like unfinished business,” the Welshman said recently."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8206c186154e4e8fbc84ac9a71c62ba3834d417/0_60_3663_2198/master/3663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3976bdf39c7ba621aacce59dbc4abbc1","title":"dylan hartley england south africa","story":"• Co-captain to win 94th cap at Twickenham on Saturday• ‘I’m just delighted I still have the chance to play for England’Never have England prepared for a Twickenham international so far from home nor entered an autumn series with so many experienced forwards missing. Plenty of pre-match stats will follow the team back to the UK from Portugal on Thursday but the most eye-catching is that the England co-captain Dylan Hartley has more caps than the rest of his pack combined.When the team-sheet is confirmed, the only seasoned red rose regulars up front will be Hartley, George Kruis and Maro Itoje, joined by a host of names either making their first home Test starts or entirely unaccustomed to this level. If South Africa do not know precisely what to expect from Brad Shields, Zach Mercer, Alec Hepburn, Tom Curry, Ben Moon, Charlie Ewels and Mark Wilson they are not alone.The aforementioned seven forwards, all set to feature at some stage, boast just seven previous starts between them and even the British \u0026amp Irish Lions tighthead Kyle Sinckler has started just one Twickenham Test. The uncapped Mercer is 21, while Curry is still only 20.Less than a year out from the 2019 World Cup the absence of the Vunipola brothers, Dan Cole, Courtney Lawes, Chris Robshaw, Joe Launchbury, Nathan Hughes and Sam Simmonds, among others, has created more holes than a workaholic woodpecker.Given England also have a new defence coach in John Mitchell and are experimenting with a dual-captaincy arrangement, it is not perhaps the ideal week to be catching a plane home from an increasingly sodden Algarve within 48 hours of the Test against South Africa on Saturday.The cunning plan is to prepare the team for the culture shocks and unfamiliar rhythms of the World Cup next year but, with the Springboks having spent the week preparing in London, the short-term benefits remain to be seen.At least they can still call on the long‑serving Hartley, back in an England starting XV for the first time in more than seven months. The 32‑year‑old is about to win the 94th cap of his career but insists the whole squad has taken a fresh guard as they prepare for the first of a potential 20 Tests in the next 12 months.“We’ve spoken about our journey over the next year and how unified we need to be, all pulling in the same direction. We want to be a different, and improved, team to what we were in South Africa in June. Unless the GPS reports on our training sessions are made up or fake news, I believe we are in fantastic condition.”Hartley is well aware, though, that nothing will come easy for himself or his team en route to Japan. “It’s a bit like climbing a mountain: the higher you get up it, the harder it gets. Everyone asks about trying to get to 100 games but I can honestly say I’m not counting. I’m just looking forward to the next one because you don’t know when your time is up. I’m just delighted I still have the chance to play for England.”Manu Tuilagi and Chris Ashton, both available this autumn after lengthy Test absences, will echo that latter sentiment and England undoubtedly boast some tantalising backline options if they can win sufficient ball. Some of us have been waiting years for Owen Farrell, Henry Slade and Tuilagi to be united at 10, 12 and 13 but Eddie Jones also has Ben Te’o at his disposal and has a tight call to make between Jack Nowell and Ashton on the wing.As for the co-captains, Hartley believes outsiders will notice scant difference. “Owen has always been a sounding board for me and vice-versa. Now he’s just got an official title.”The pair are already regular room-mates, although Hartley is keen not to paint too cosy a domestic picture. “It’s not like we have two fishfinger beds next to each other. He’s in one room, I’m in the other and we’ve got a little lounge area. He sings in the shower, makes the coffee and watches football on the telly.”When Saturday comes, though, Hartley accepts a different sort of switch will need to be flicked for England to prosper. “It is for the likes of Owen and myself to really drive it forward. The team has been picked for a reason, because they’re performing.”Newcomers such as Moon and others will be expected to rise to the challenge instantly. “Test rugby is a different animal but top-flight European rugby, which those guys have been playing, is a pretty good level. I’m just going to say: ‘Do what you do for Exeter but 100 times better.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb44dc3e5210b3dd12514012bff126d2cf54ee8d/0_436_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eadec5c32bb5dcef6b560c6c41e82ec2","title":"readers travel photography competition october winners","story":"This month’s picks range from epic landscapes to city scenes.

Anybody can do it,” Mandal told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday after his victory was announced.“Baking is science. It’s a mixture of physics, chemistry and engineering.”The series was filmed over the summer but the results were kept secret until the final aired on Channel 4 on Tuesday. Mandal’s colleague David Anson revealed he stopped bringing cakes into work when he was accepted on to the show because he did not want to “give the game away”.“He’s been carrying on with his job. He’s doing first rate research using lasers, it’s really complex. He’s just a league above ... He’s a bright spark,” Anson told the Press Association.Mandal first brought a cake into work in June 2016, but his Victoria sponge did not impress the office.“He said it was his second ever cake that he’d iced. It was very over the top in colour and thickness. That wasn’t brilliant. I couldn’t eat the icing. It was 50-50 cake and icing,” Anson said.“After that he kept bringing more and more bakes into work for people to try. He always bakes for someone’s birthday, he wants the excuse to bake a cake. After a while he was thinking of applying for Bake Off. He did apply last year and got a telephone interview but that was all.“He spent the next year improving and improving and improving, and taking photographs of his stuff. More esoteric stuff started coming in.”Mandal overcame a major setback in the final when a jar shattered, spraying shards of glass across his workbench.Leith and Hollywood granted him extra time at the end of challenge to make up for the 15 minutes he lost. Some fans of the show were upset by the decision and said Kim-Joy should have been crowned champion.Anson said of his colleague’s showstopper: “The sludge tasted beautiful. I ate most of it. But at the end of the day it really was very close.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ea5b891da08309e5d3592b6a2a03ce7bdc9de76/0_98_3001_1801/master/3001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a90b4e3dc9e8d798f7d56ac25c5e00e","title":"secret story stuff tv review","story":"Zoe Laughlin blends bonhomie, excitement and expertise to shine a light on the latest scientific ideasAny sufficiently advanced form of technology is indistinguishable from magic, runs the third and most famous of Arthur C Clarke’s laws. On the face of last night’s evidence, then, Zoe Laughlin is not just a designer and materials engineer but a magician too.Laughlin – as the presenter of The Secret Story of Stuff: Materials of the Modern Age (BBC Four) – blends bonhomie, excitement and expertise in perfect proportions, while shining a little light into the darkness of what is for most of us a profound ignorance about the new stuff that is being invented out there and the uses to which it can, will and is being put.Part Ripley’s Believe It Or Not museum (and why, incidentally, do we not have a programme based entirely on Ripley’s Believe It Or Not museum?), part Tomorrow’s World, part Proper Science documentary, its wonders left your mind boggled and the rest of you well and truly winded.Did you know that you can make a spring out of nitinol (a nickel-titanium alloy), straighten it out, then heat it up a bit and watch it, well, spring instantly back into shape? Did you know that Nasa invented the lightest solid in the world – aerogel – in order to catch comet dust? Did you know that you can build up layer upon layer of powdered titanium into gently curving porous domes that look like they have been spun by futuristic spiders? And that you can then use those domes as the ball part of replacement hip joints? The bone will gradually grow into them until body and machine work in perfect harmony for so long that its last act will probably be a shuffle off this mortal coil.If you do know all this already, don’t roll your eyes and sneer. Be glad! And tell me why you have been keeping this fascinating knowledge to yourself.Laughlin took us around various sectors and industries to look at the latest innovations. Zirconia, ground down to nano-sized particles to make false teeth and crowns, has solved the problem of hydrothermal ageing – which is the problem of saliva working its way into the tiny cracks between grains of false teeth and breaking the whole lot down. And the new particles can be made into a paste thin enough to be squirted through the tiny nozzle of a 3D printer. In 20 minutes you, sir, can have a brand new bespoke molar that will last even longer than your powdered titanium spider hip. The future is so nearly here.In the building industry, things are almost more thrilling because – get this – houses are being grown out of mushrooms! Seriously. Almost. It turns out that, if you’ve a mind to, you can throw a few appropriate nutrients into a mould and get mycelium (mushroom roots, basically – don’t write in, fungi fans, it’s good enough for our purposes here) to fill it. Some strains will even eat metal as they go. The result – as Laughlin proved with a blowtorch, a choc ice and a slab of the ’shroomy stuff in between – is a brilliant insulator and, one day soon, construction material.Other people are busy developing leather and cotton alternatives out of banana leaves, materials that could revolutionise bulletproof clothing and vehicles, and the protection against bomb attacks in airports, schools, shopping centres and other public buildings. Oh, and pretty soon we’re going to be able to store the digitised entirety of human knowledge – down to the very last fuzzy snap of the very least favourite grandchild – on a few thousand tiny glass discs. Good times!The Secret Story of Stuff would make a very good replacement for The Great British Bake Off. Like the beloved cake show, it has a salivatory quality. It is the kind of programme that fills you with sensations so rare as to be not instantly recognisable. There was eager anticipation of what the next twist or turn of human ingenuity and intellect would show. There was awe and there was wonder.

Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world. Thirty nations had declared war between 1914 and 1918. Many countries along with Great Britain sided with the allies, including France, Italy, Russia, and the United States. The Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria supported Germany.Do you have letters, diaries, photographs or even memorabilia from any relatives or friends who remember Armistice Day?

They are the ultimate. It’s like the McMafia programme, they comfort themselves by being at wonderful events and not getting their hands dirty, but their hands are as dirty as the person trafficking the child that they’re making their money from.“We’re going to make sure that people who are proactively being facilitators are at the front of our queue as much as the actual nominals of the organised crime groups and we’re going to do everything we can to prosecute them.”The government is also expected to toughen up its approach to Scottish limited partnerships, a business loophole that it believes has been used by foreign criminals to launder dirty money in the UK.But the principal focus of the serious and organised crime strategy, published on Thursday, is the crackdown on illicit finance and the professionals who facilitate it. If they fail to report suspicious activity they face sanctions including, ultimately, jail.Wallace said he wanted to prevent serious offenders from using their illegal cash to boost their reputations. “Part of that is going after the status. If all you can go shopping with is a Tesco Clubcard, you’re not really much of a gangster are you?” he said.“If you’re denied your ability to spend your ill-gotten gains, if you can’t go and buy a flash car or a box at a sporting event or a nice house in Belgravia, if you can’t do any of that then you strip away the ability for them to launder their reputation.”He added: “We need to go after the people who have not played their part in hardening the environment and reporting. So the purveyors of luxury goods, the public schools, the sporting institutions, who don’t ask many questions if suspicious people come along with cash or other activities, we will come down on them.”High-value car dealers are regulated and so are required to file suspicious activity reports if they suspect money-laundering. Schools, although not obliged to report, are still subject to money-laundering laws.The regulatory bodies for property, accountancy and the law have already been hauled in by Wallace and Treasury minister John Glen, who warned them that unless they did more to root out illicit activity, their members would face closer scrutiny.The beefed-up response will include new specially trained police to improve and coordinate fraud investigations, more officers at the National Crime Agency to identify and seize criminals’ money, and extra investment in data and intelligence assessments.The government had been accused of not doing enough to tackle money laundering in the wake of the Panama Papers revelations, unveiled by organisations including the  in 2016. Wallace admitted that the system had not been responsive enough, but added that since then UK authorities had begun 68 criminal investigations, as well as seized £1.6bn in assets since 2010 and frozen hundreds of millions more.He added: “Too many people have felt that security and prosperity are mutually exclusive and it’s just not … Post-Brexit if we’re going to make Britain and the City of London successful then it has to have a reputation for cleanliness and security.”“It goes to the heart of how passive do you want to be? Those middle class people taking themselves into the nail bar in the local high street who don’t think they’re really fuelling organised crime, well they are. The point of this is that we all have a role to play.”The national economic crime centre will target domestic organised crime, such as county lines gangs that use vulnerable young people as drugs mules, as well as major international gangs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/771325eb1a7787ae93892dee6d8f5c75a06a303f/0_0_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4fe26dce8c454838ce9fea9c0b7524b","title":"thursday briefing dirty money blitz from estate agents to nail bars","story":"Crackdown on £100bn in money laundering … Khashoggi’s sudden, barbaric, deliberate death … and introducing our Today in Focus podcastGood morning.

Dominic Raab sent the pound higher by writing to the Commons Brexit committee saying he would be “happy to give evidence when a deal is finalised, and currently expect November 21 to be suitable”. No 10 was caught by surprise and a reverse ferret came three hours later from Raab who clarified there was “no set date for the negotiations to conclude”. In a significant sign of possible progress, though, the Times has reported overnight that Theresa May has reached a deal with Brussels to maintain UK financial services companies’ continued access to European markets. The EU will reportedly accept that the UK has “equivalent” regulations to Brussels. Brussels and the UK would reportedly have to consult each other before changing or setting new financial regulations that could affect equivalence.Khashoggi ‘killed straight away’ – Jamal Khashoggi was strangled in a premeditated killing as soon as he entered Saudi Arabia’s consulate, Turkish prosecutors have said. It sweeps aside Saudi explanations that he died accidentally in some sort of botched rogue rendition attempt. “The victim’s body was dismembered and destroyed following his death by suffocation,” said Istanbul’s chief prosecutor, Irfan Fidan. The Saudi prosecutor has been in Istanbul but tensions are apparent in what is supposed to be a joint investigation – Fidan said their discussions had yielded “no concrete result”. Turkey is believed to be keeping to itself damning audio and video evidence related to Khashoggi’s death.Brave steps – Two men paralysed more than six years ago can stand and walk short distances with crutches or other support after their spinal cords were treated with electrical stimulation. “When you stimulate the nerves like this it triggers plasticity in the cells,” explained Swiss neuroscientist Grégoire Courtine. “The brain is trying to stimulate, and we stimulate at same time, and we think that triggers the growth of new nerve connections.”The stimulation is timed to coincide with movement signals still being sent from the brain, and has to be kept up while the patient attempts to walk. “The big challenge is whether it can really change their life,” Courtine said. “This is an important first step, but the key now is to apply this very early after an injury when the potential for recovery is much larger.” His next trial will include patients whose injuries are no more than a month old. Meanwhile there is growing evidence that removing the appendix might help prevent or delay Parkinson’s disease. Medical researchers think proteins held in the appendix might be escaping via a major nerve and reaching the brain where they cause damage.Pints revoked – Round-the-clock drinking at UK airports could become a thing of the past under a Home Office review. Airlines have been calling for a crackdown on alcohol sales before flights following a spike in incidents involving drunken behaviour – they have warned that intoxicated passengers can expect to face fines of up to £80,000 if a plane has to be erted because of disruptive behaviour.

It is not yet clear whether they have picked up the cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder, or both.Officials say they don’t believe anyone on the new aircraft flying from Jakarta to the island of Bangka survived the crash into the Java Sea on Monday. Ground staff lost touch with Lion Air flight JT610 13 minutes after it took off.Indonesian Navy er Sertu Hendra told local news portal Detik his team had followed the “pings” or signals from the devices until they able to determine the exact location. “We followed the tool, reducing the area in the place the tools were picking up sounds, and it turns out we got the black box,” he said.The search for the devices, believed to be the key to determining why the new plane crashed, was initially hampered by strong sea currents.Kompas TV reported the black box had been collected by the Baruna Jaya ship assisting in the search operation.Indonesian police have identified the first victim of the crash.The passenger has been named as Jannatun Cintya Dewi, a 24-year-old woman from Sidoarjo, East Java, and a civil servant for the energy ministry in Jakarta.Highlighting the gruesome nature of the task, Brigadier-General Hudi Suryanto, in charge of the Automatic Finger Print Identification System (INAFIS), said investigators had identified the first victim on the third day of the search after finding her right hand.The forensic team ran a fingerprint check, which matched data from Indonesia’s national ID card system. The results were then crosschecked with documents and photos provided by the victim’s family.“We’ve examined 48 body bags of victim remains and we could identify one victim through primary identification, which is fingerprints and dental records,” Suryanto told reporters. The disaster victim identification team has taken 152 DNA samples from the families to help identify the victims, with devastated family members flocking to the hospital to hand over toothbrushes, dental records and photographs of their loved ones to assist in the process.Search and rescue teams, including a team of specialised ers, scoured the waters off Java for the plane fuselage on Thursday morning, the fourth day of the search.The search and rescue agency chief, Muhammad Syaugi, said the currents were so strong they had shifted a large ship, and that efforts were further complicated by oil and gas pipelines in the vicinity.Syaugi said he believed the fuselage was located 32 metres down, 400 metres north-west of where the plane had lost contact. If found, the fuselage would be lifted using a crane, because many bodies were likely to be trapped inside, he said.The accident is the first to be reported involving the widely sold Boeing 737 MAX, an updated, more fuel-efficient version of the manufacturer’s single-aisle jet.The plane’s black boxes, as the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder are known, should help to explain why the almost-new jet went down minutes after take-off.As the media speculated about the airworthiness of the aircraft, the transport minister suspended the budget airline’s technical director and several technicians to facilitate the crash investigation.According to KNKT, the plane had technical problems on its previous flight on Sunday, from the city of Denpasar on the resort island of Bali, including an “unreliable airspeed” issue.Lion Air, which was founded in 1999 and is privately owned, said the aircraft had been in operation since August, had been airworthy and that the pilot and co-pilot had 11,000 hours of flying time between them.The airline’s chief executive, Edward Sirait, has acknowledged reports of technical problems with the aircraft, but said maintenance had been carried out “according to procedure” before it was cleared to fly again.Investigators are looking into why the pilot had asked to return to base shortly after takeoff, a request that ground control officials granted shortly before the crash."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"President is expected to make scrutiny proposal to Government following inaugurationDublin City Council is considering seeking a judicial review of decision on \u0026euro10m projectCommittee has not met since April as result of incident at Labre Park, BallyfermotGovernment restores grants on condition the organisation reforms child protection rules\u0026lsquoBepiColumbo\u0026rsquo must beat complex gravity and speed challenges on its \u0026euro1.6bn mission\u0026lsquoBands of hail\u0026rsquo mean exposed motorways are \u0026lsquolike driving on ball bearings\u0026rsquo, RSA warnsChief executive indicates need for tougher measures after car set on fire in latest attackDublin Fire Brigade and its ambulance service urge caution during a busy dayMan (25) was travelling from Los Angeles to Sydney on October 10thFergus Slattery in dispute with wife of ex-financial adviser over sale of south Dublin siteAccused pleads guilty to possessing 14kg of cannabisMother tells coroner of child\u0026rsquos final momentsLaptop found in defendant\u0026rsquos home \u0026lsquosearched sailings\u0026rsquoINMO declines to attend meeting of oversight committee after rejecting pay proposalsA further 13 schools build by Western Building Systems are the subject of ongoing structural assessment and analysisLaois multimillionaire (92) would be \u0026lsquohorrified\u0026rsquo at her \u0026euro30m donation becoming publicGarda whistleblower to meet Minister for Justice on Friday after leaving the forceIrish and French ministers discuss contingency plans for trade at Paris meeting10 per cent of the earth\u0026rsquos wilderness which serves as a brake to effects of climate change has been lost since the 1990sJudge says elderly woman diagnosed with senile self-neglect syndrome and dementia"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3681914.1541019992!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"elizabeth o kelly the generous widow who left her fortune to charity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tElizabeth O’Kelly: “She was very quiet . . . She would have reminded you of Miss Marple.” Photograph: Alf HarveyFr Seán Kelly says that when Elizabeth O’Kelly gave him €12,000 to help fund the painting of the Catholic Church in Stradbally, Co Laois, she insisted there was no fuss made about her donation. “She was a very simple, very humble, no-fuss lady. She didn’t parade her wealth or grandeur in any way. She didn’t ever present herself as a millionaire or anything like that,” said the priest.Ms O’Kelly’s five-figure donation in life pales into insignificance in light of the extraordinary act of generosity by the Co Laois dowager that emerged this week almost two years after her death. The late widow bequeathed €30 million to five charities – €6 million each to the Irish Cancer Society, Irish Heart Foundation, Irish Kidney Association, the Irish Society for Autism and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) – after her death in December 2016 at the age of 92. The RNLI said on Wednesday it was “deeply grateful and humbled” by the generosity of Ms O’Kelly, who for many years volunteered her time to help out at the RNLI stall at the RDS in Dublin. She held a high regard for the charity’s volunteer work, which appealed to her ethos, a spokesperson for the RNLI said.“Throughout her life, she displayed great kindness towards her many friends and was most charitable in supporting those in need,” said the spokesperson.The €6 million donation to the Irish Cancer Society alone was the largest donation ever received by the charity, and the equivalent of two annual Daffodil Day fundraising efforts. Ms O’Kelly had first-hand knowledge of the work carried out by the charity. She survived a battle with cancer in the 1980s.“She was pleasant and very Christian-minded in her attitude to life and people. I’d say anybody that didn’t know her would be surprised to know that she was wealthy,” said Fr Kelly.The extraordinary story of this multimillionaire has captured people’s imaginations, said one of the sources who knew Ms O’Kelly. Her backstory makes her charitable actions even more extraordinary.Born in January 1924 and orphaned as an infant, she was brought to Ireland from France, her place of birth, as a two-year-old. Her father, Otway Richard Sykes of Yorkshire, and an older sibling had already died before she was born. She was raised by her paternal aunt Annette Sykes on Leeson Street in Dublin, who imbued in her a charitable and considerate ethos and a devotion to religion. In 1945, at the age of 21, she married Maj John William O’Kelly, a veterinary surgeon in the British Army who was awarded an OBE. Her husband died on March 3rd, 1962.She lived in Ballygoran in Maynooth, Co Kildare where she was remembered for her active social life and her “tennis parties and splendid teas”. She later moved to Dower House on the grounds of Emo Park in Co Laois and, in her final years, lived in a Georgian house on Market Square in Stradbally.“She lived very simply, very modestly but I would say very austerely,” said a source who knew her well. “That said, she was also extraordinarily generous and charitable to her friends.”Her only extravagance was her love of travel – to India, North America and the Far East and on trips with the Georgian Society. She was also very active with the Co Kildare Archaeological Society and was involved with the Alliance Française owing to her French connection.“She was very quiet, like a quiet maiden aunt. She would have reminded you of Miss Marple. She was very demure, a gentle sort of person – a lovely, lovely lady,” said another person who knew her.It was her ownership of 22 per cent of the Leinster Leader group of regional newspapers that brought both her biggest windfall and her public exposure as a wealthy widow. The media organisation was sold for €138.5 million in 2005. After debts were paid off, she took a near-quarter share of the €120 million spread among a erse group of shareholders, paying capital gains tax in full on the sum.She had a long association with the group but very much in the capacity of a silent shareholder. She went to her first annual general meeting of the group in the 1960s after her husband’s death.“We only heard from her from agm to agm,” said one man who was involved in the business. He speculated that few in Stradbally would have known of Ms O’Kelly until her €26.4 million share of the Leinster Leader group sale became public. The altruism behind her biggest charitable act may have been driven by the fact that her biggest windfall came from the Leinster Leader shares passing to her as a result of two deaths: her husband’s first wife Mary – a descendant of James Laurence Carew, the Parnellite MP for North Kildare who took control of the Leinster Leader in 1886 – and Ms O’Kelly’s husband.Handed a multimillion-euro windfall, and with no living relatives in Ireland, she decided to give it away.“She regarded the money almost as if it was not her money to spend. She was comfortably well off and it had come to her through fortuitous circumstances she took the view that she should do some good from it. From 2005, she decided she was going to give that money away to charity,” said a source.Her first charitable act was to 180 Leinster Leader staff who each received a gift of €3,000 – “as a gesture of appreciation”, the letter from a Dublin solicitor’s office read without naming the shareholder. Each envelope sent to staff contained a cheque and landed just before Christmas 2005. The €3,000 limit was to avoid staff incurring any capital acquisitions tax on the gift.Her wealth is believed to have come from two other families, the Coopers, who owned Markree Castle in Sligo, and the Bowen family, big landowners who lived at Kilnacourt in Portarlington. “It was as if she was a recipient from several strands of family inheritance,” said one source.Anyone who knew this deeply private woman spoke of her likely alarm at the publicity her massive donations have generated this week. Two sources, both close to her, each said she would be “horrified”.“The one aspect of it she wouldn’t like is the publicity and the fuss,” said Fr Kelly."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3681947.1541023070!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"higgins begins work on group to audit 317 000 allowance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins ‘is committed to establishing an audit committee’, a spokesman said. Photograph: Martial TrezziniEPAPresident Michael D Higgins has begun consulting with advisers and staff on setting up an audit committee to scrutinise how an “additional” allowance of €317,000 is spent. The President committed during the election campaign to provide a mechanism that would furnish complete information on the annual allowance, which is unaudited and has been available to all presidents since 1938 (and at the current level since 1998). A spokesman said: “The President is committed to establishing an audit committee and is currently consulting on how best to achieve effective reporting on all the financial resources of the office of President.”The President is expected to make the proposal to the Government following his inauguration for a second seven-year term in November. The issue of the allowance was a dominant theme of the campaign with the President being subjected to questions about how it was spent in every interview and public appearance. He said the money is used for garden parties, State dinners and for the estimated 20,000 people who are invited to Áras an Uachtaráin each year. During the campaign, Mr Higgins said he would not disclose the full details until November, because it would create a precedent for future holders of the office. “If I were to make a change now I would be introducing a change that would make my life and answering questions like this very much easier, everything is very much straightforward,” he replies. “I think it’s much better to do it on an annual basis. When we do a full set of accounts, you will find the figure will be the same as it was that my predecessors,” he told The  in an interview. “It would be improper of me to put my own comfort in relation to the campaign ahead of what is the proper decision to make on behalf of the presidency as an institution.”“It is not an allowance to me. It is an allowance to the performance of the Presidency. Anything that changes will affect the precedence that will come after me into the future. I prefer to do it in an orderly way.”The new audit committee will be separate to an existing audit committee, which scrutinises the overall budget of the Áras but has had no role in looking at the €317,000 allowance. At a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee held two days in advance of the campaign, it emerged that the committee had not met for four years because its chairman was indisposed. A new chairman, Joe Hanlon, was appointed earlier this year and that committee has met three times. Meanwhile, the President has been warmly congratulated on his re-election and wished “every success for the years ahead” by the European Commission. Its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, wrote to him saying his “understanding of the power of words to hurt or heal and to empower or ide is the mark of a true statesman”.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3681880.1541010765!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"chinese one country two systems idea could unlock brexit impasse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May: Ultimately, the withdrawal and Belfast agreements are reconcilable.

To protect it, in the words of EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, “in its entirety, every line, every letter”.The withdrawal agreement will be an international treaty, as is the Belfast Agreement, and the two share a central purpose: the redefining, redrawing, and ordering of the relationship between two sovereign polities and the managing of transition in that relationship.In one case, the agreement is open-ended, with the possibility of decisive parting of Northern Ireland from the UK through a referendum at some stage on unity the other involves a formal rupture of the UK from the EU, with Northern Ireland remaining in the former, but in a special relationship to the latter.What has become fiercely contested in the attempt to marry the two agreements is precisely the constitutional status of Northern Ireland in that new special relationship.Does the possibility of customs controls, or any kind of checks, on the Irish Sea really undermine the constitutional order and character of the Union and really constitute such a threat that, in Theresa May’s words, “no British prime minister could ever agree to it”?And the Belfast Agreement is proof of it.Signed up to by a British prime minister, the Belfast Agreement represented, in the political sphere, precisely the sort of “one country, two systems” thinking – China’s rationalisation for Hong Kong’s separate development under its control after Beijing took over – that customs controls on the Irish Sea might do in the economic sphere.Why should we see economic ergence as qualitatively different from political ergence?The Belfast Agreement wasn’t just about a new power-sharing, devolved government and the breaking of the culture of majoritarianism, so much part of the political culture of Toryism and unionism.The agreement also enshrined minority rights and human rights, a new voting system, a provision for a referendum on unity, an acknowledgment of Ireland’s interest in the governance of the North . . . all contributing to the idea that the Union’s survival as such did not require all its various parts to work the same way.A deal was possible only because unionist politicians in the North and in the UK were able to accept – some only eventually – that such a transitional status for the North, although in effect on a separate political path from the rest of the UK, did not represent a qualitative transformation of the Union or the undermining of their status as UK citizens.And they accepted that North-South co-operation in myriad projects can be cast as a normal, healthy win-win relationship between neighbours, rather than a fundamental concession of sovereignty. Just as trade can be in the future.Niall Ó Dochartaigh, of the politics department in NUI Galway, has written in an important and insightful paper on the Irish Humanities blog on the relationship between the two agreements.“Contrary to unionist arguments that the Belfast Agreement essentially freezes relations across the border and the Irish Sea,” he argues, “the open-ended references in it to cross-border bodies and possible future expansion of North-South co-operation implicitly allow for the kind of reordering of relationships between the Republic and the North of the kind that would be involved in special EU status for Northern Ireland.”No way, says the DUP.And yet, ironically, as Ó Dochartaigh points out, “one of the most unexpected twists in the past year is the way in which prominent unionist politicians have taken strong ownership of the Belfast Agreement. It was rejected and opposed by the DUP in 1998, but senior party members now invoke it as a kind of unionist backstop, a fundamental document that rules out any changes in the relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as the UK leaves the European Union.”Ultimately, the withdrawal and Belfast agreements are reconcilable. They will have to be if the no-hard-border backstop, to which the UK has already committed itself, is to be agreed.But a reconciliation is only possible if London and the DUP embrace the Belfast Agreement Chinese logic of “one country, two systems”."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"US calls for immediate cessation of hostilities in the region ahead of planned UN talksGovernment \u0026lsquoworking with France\u0026rsquo on initiative, T\u0026aacutenaiste saysAsia Bibi had been on death row since 2010 accused of insulting MuhammadAlthough towns are no longer battlefields, many Syrians remain reluctant to returnAir strikes have garnered attention, but worst effects of war are economicSecretary of state Mike Pompeo says UN-led talks to end the fighting should begin next monthAsia Bibi had been on death row since 2010 accused of insulting MuhammadMove comes after Erdogan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquofinal warning\u0026rsquo to those endangering Turkey\u0026rsquos bordersTurkey\u0026rsquos president has chance to get an unexpected boost in regional power struggleMajority of those killed were children and teachers on a school tour near the Dead SeaAs many as 14m people could be entirely dependent on aid to surviveSaudi prince told investors writer\u0026rsquos killing would not derail the kingdom\u0026rsquos reform driveThe journalist vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in TurkeyTurkish president contradicts Saudi Arabia as Prince Mohammed appears at conferenceHuman Rights Watch criticises Palestinian Authority and Hamas for crushing dissentErdogan to give parliament \u0026lsquonaked truth\u0026rsquo about journalist\u0026rsquos murder in speech on TuesdayMinister says iniduals exceeded authority Erdogan suggests he may release information over killingTurkish president trails revealing statement for Tuesday about slain dissident journalistUS president says \u0026lsquolies\u0026rsquo told about killing of journalist in kingdom\u0026rsquos Turkish consulateUN stresses need for prompt investigation and \u0026lsquofull accountability for those responsible\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3682040.1541024838!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"international pressure increases for an end to yemen conflict","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Yemenis carry the coffin of a Houthi militia member  killed in ongoing fighting in the war-torn Arab country. Photograph: Yahya ArhabEPA The United States has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Yemen in a sign that international pressure is intensifying to bring an end to the 3½-year conflict. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo urged the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels to stop launching missile and drone strikes against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But he also called on the Saudi-led coalition to cease all air strikes in populated areas of Yemen. He said that UN negotiations should begin this month. Mr Pompeo’s comments were reiterated by defence secretary James Mattis, who told an audience in Washington that “meaningful steps” towards negotiations needed to take place in the next 30 days. The words of warning from the highest level of the US government reflect a growing sense that the US may be seeking to use leverage against Saudi Arabia following the international outrage over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. The Saudis have played a central role in the civil war in Yemen. Together with the UAE, Saudi fighters have been helping to repel Houthi rebels who seized Saana, the capital, in 2015.While the US has no direct role in the war in Yemen it is an important Saudi ally and provider of arms. Britain said it supported the United States’s call for a de-escalation of activities, though prime minister Theresa May told parliament on Wednesday that she only backed a cessation of hostilities if there was a political deal between the parties. Like the United States, Britain is an ally of Saudi Arabia and sells arms to the kingdom. At least 10,000 people are believed to have been killed in Yemen since the conflict began. The country of 28 million people is already one of the poorest in the world. Saudi Arabia in particular has been criticised for bombing civilian areas. The brutal killing of Khashoggi has focused world attention on Saudi Arabia, including its role in the Yemeni war, which is approaching its fourth year. Planned UN-led peace talks in Geneva last month collapsed after the Houthi delegation failed to show up, alleging that the Saudi-led coalition had blocked representatives from travelling to the talks.The renewed pressure on Saudi Arabia to find a solution to the Yemeni war came as Turkey revealed fresh details of Khashoggi’s killing. A state prosecutor in Istanbul said on Wednesday that the US resident had been asphyxiated as soon as he entered the Saudi consulate in the city on October 2nd. His body was then dismembered before being disposed of in an unknown location. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused the Saudi regime of “playing games” by refusing to disclose information about the location of Khashoggi’s remains."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000149237555_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNS5hEVD_CfJKkthCEMeCOFS7pt8E3ovWvjsKwVAna8M.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"challenging china us champions trade aid race invest africa","story":"The new US embassy in LondonAmerica looks set to unveil a new trade-oriented Africa policy which will champion US corporate investment over conventional development aid.The move reflects concern in Washington that the west risks being outgunned by China in terms of direct investment on the rapidly developing continent.While the US remains the single biggest investor in Africa by some margin, China is catching up fast has become dominant in the area of large scale infrastructure.London and Paris, with which Washington is working closely, have both said they will increase direct investment in Africa in recent months.Speaking in London, Mr Tibor Nagy, the newly appointed US assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said he had become frustrated with the way some African countries had become dependent on aid and that US policy would now seek to promote a “journey to self reliance”.“There is not enough development money in the world to lead Africa to development but there is certainly enough foreign direct investment to do the same thing”, he said.President Donald Trump recently approved the Better Utilisation of Investments Leading to Development Act (Build), legislation that will double, to $60 billion, funds for promoting US corporate investment in Africa.Following China\u0027s lead, the Act will also enable a newly created US government agency to take a direct equity stake of its own in development projects in Africa for the first time.Defusing the \u0026#039demographic timebomb\u0026#039 | Global population issuesCritics say that while the move is welcome the sums involved are not enough and are still dwarfed by new Chinese investment planned for Africa.Mr Nagy, an old Africa hand whose triplets were the first to be born in Zimbabwe after its independence in 1980, said the next 30 years would be pivotal for Africa as its population was set to nearly double to 2.5 billion by 2050.“There will be millions and millions of young people”, he said.Addressing the challenge posed by China in Africa, Mr Nagy said it would be wrong to cast it in the same good-guy-bad-guy light that characterised much western investment there during the cold war investment that fueled conflict and sowed the seeds of continent’s later debt crisis.“I certainly can’t blame African states that there are so many Chinese companies involved there”, he said. “When there was a knock on the door and they opened it, it was only the Chinese that were standing there.“I’d like to make sure that the next time there is a knock on the door it is more than the Chinese standing there… I would like to see US companies standing there.”Nevertheless, Mr Nagy said China’s lending to Africa could threaten a new debt trap one that could result in countries having to surrender strategic assets such as ports and airports to China unless they were able to keep up repayments.He also made clear the US would not hide its light under a bushel when it came to promoting the merits of US corporate investment over Chinese competition in Africa.“Our companies maintain different standards”, he said, “different labour standards, different environmental standards.“The trees don\u0027t disappear. The wildlife does not disappear. And everybody beyond the rank of turning a shovel doesn\u0027t come from the US to do that job... Oh, and by the way, we don\u0027t leave the country billions of dollars in debt.”Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Comment: If the Germans can come to the Cenotaph, why not the Rhodesians?Find the right newsletter for youSerious and organised crime \u0026#39costs UK economy £37bn a year\u0026#39Divers recover Lion Air jet\u0026#39s flight recorder on Indonesia seafloorComment: Yemen is on the brink of collapse, and calls for a ceasefire are welcomeFears over pre-teens being exposed to inappropriate adverts online, as regulators step up controlsKim Jong-un condemns sanctions as the work of ‘hostile forces’NHS needs #Metoo moment to stamp out sexual harassment, doctors\u0026#39 union saysComment: We must act now to end the flow of criminal cash across our countrySouth Korea court allows conscientious objection to military servicePrince of Wales: I warned of plastic danger 40 years ago but was dismissed as \u0026#39out of touch\u0026#39Donald Trump suggests 15,000 troops could be sent to US-Mexico border to counter migrant caravans Britain is “medicalising” children rather than bringing them up properly, the head of the health service has saidColombian kidnappers demand ransom for Garcia Marquez relativeHarvey Weinstein accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girlMinister on brink of quitting over delay in cutting stakes for \u0026#39crack cocaine\u0026#39 gambling machinesMichel Barnier under mounting pressure to compromise with Britain over Irish backstopEssex seaside village outraged after being used in pro-Trump campaign advertComment: This is the radical Brexit speech Theresa May could still make We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain medicalising children rather bringing properly head","story":"Simon Stevens suggested society needs to face up to its responsibilities to childrenDuty of Care CampaignBanner: Duty of CareBritain is increasingly “medicalising” children instead of bringing them up properly,  the head of the health service has warned.Simon Stevens said the NHS will expand its mental health services in response to rising levels of anxiety and distress fuelled by social media.But he said that far more needed to be done to protect children, by giving them an upbringing which shielded them from some of today\u0027s pressures.Health officials are currently drawing up plans to improve access to children’s mental health services, with £2bn a year set aside for mental healthcare.  But Mr Stevens said society needed to take more fundamental steps, to give children a better chance in life.The head of the NHS has already backed The Daily ’s duty of care campaign, calling for more stringent regulation of social media sites, in order to protect children from harm.Yesterday he told MPs that society needed to take action on the “underlying causes” of the twin epidemics of obesity and mental health problems afflicting today’s children.“There are broader questions that I think are quite fundamental here,” he told the Public Accounts Committee, highlighting the impact of social media  on Britain’s youth.“What is it that is driving the increase in the mental health problems, self-harm, various other expressions of distress and lack of psychological wellbeing on the part of young people?”Earlier this month Mr Stevens called for a levy on social media firms to fund NHS treatment of problems fuelled by social media.He also called for a ban on breast enlargement advertisments during Love Island, warning that the adverts - later banned - risked stoking body dysmorphia.Yesterday he said action to protect children from pressures online was critical, warning that statistics due to be published within weeks are set to show record levels of mental health problems among children.“We can’t just medicalise the failure to provide our children with a healthy and nurturing childhood,” he told MPs.Earlier this month Mr Stevens told a global summit that there is now a compelling body of evidence demonstrating the damaging impact of social media on children, which appears to be fuelling rising admissions to mental health services.Charities are concerned that long periods online mean children are growing up feeling increasingly inadequate, as they compare themselves to lives on Intagram on Facebook.Dame Sally Davies, England’s chief medical officer, is currently carrying out a review of the impact on technology on children, which will consider whether the government should issue recommended screen time limits.It follows research in the Lancet  Child and Adolescent Health which found that children who spend more than two hours a day on smartphones and video games have significantly worse brain development than those with more strict limits.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreProtect yourself and your family.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

But they are still trying to work out how they died.The pair, born in Jeddah, were living until the summer in Fairfax, Virginia.Shortly before their deaths, they had applied for asylum in the US, their mother said.She told detectives, according to the New York Post, that the day before their bodies were discovered, she received a phone call from the Saudi Arabian embassy informing her that the family\u0027s residency in the US was in jeopardy because the two had applied for immigration asylum.She said that she had not seen her daughters since December 2017, when she reported them missing to police in Fairfax.Virginia police found them soon after, but rather than return home they went to live in a local shelter, and police refused to tell them where it was, The New York Post reported.Tala was reported missing again by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in August, but the English-language ArabNews, citing unnamed family members, reported that the mother called off the search when it was discovered the teenager was visiting her older sister at an unspecified college in New York.The Saudi Arabian consulate in New York issued a statement confirming that the sisters were both Saudi Arabian citizens, and saying they were students, “accompanying their brother in Washington.”New York police are treating their death as suicide, the NYPD told The , but stressed that the investigation was still in its early stages.However, a relative told Saudi newspaper Arab News that there had not been any family trouble, and dismissed reports they may had taken their own lives.“They were a democratic family, they never had any issues and the eldest was sent to college in New York City with her family’s blessing,” said the family member.Comment: If the Germans can come to the Cenotaph, why not the Rhodesians?Find the right newsletter for youSerious and organised crime \u0026#39costs UK economy £37bn a year\u0026#39Divers recover Lion Air jet\u0026#39s flight recorder on Indonesia seafloorComment: Yemen is on the brink of collapse, and calls for a ceasefire are welcomeFears over pre-teens being exposed to inappropriate adverts online, as regulators step up controlsKim Jong-un condemns sanctions as the work of ‘hostile forces’NHS needs #Metoo moment to stamp out sexual harassment, doctors\u0026#39 union saysComment: We must act now to end the flow of criminal cash across our countrySouth Korea court allows conscientious objection to military servicePrince of Wales: I warned of plastic danger 40 years ago but was dismissed as \u0026#39out of touch\u0026#39Donald Trump suggests 15,000 troops could be sent to US-Mexico border to counter migrant caravans Britain is “medicalising” children rather than bringing them up properly, the head of the health service has saidColombian kidnappers demand ransom for Garcia Marquez relativeHarvey Weinstein accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girlMinister on brink of quitting over delay in cutting stakes for \u0026#39crack cocaine\u0026#39 gambling machinesMichel Barnier under mounting pressure to compromise with Britain over Irish backstopEssex seaside village outraged after being used in pro-Trump campaign advertComment: This is the radical Brexit speech Theresa May could still make We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"find right newsletter","story":"Top stories, fine writing and analysis are hallmarks of  journalism - and all these help to ensure that our readers are at the forefront of our minds.Because of this, we offer 36 different email newsletters, covering everything from business and technology to food and film, cars to culture and brexit to beauty.Some  newsletters are sent to our readers daily and others weekly.

There needs to be a more pragmatic, flexible approach to North Korea”.During the last meeting between senior North Korean officials and Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, Pyongyang refused to provide a list of nuclear facilities and assets. Washington says there can be no progress in the stalled denuclearisation talks until Pyongyang comes clean on its nuclear capabilities. Please review our commenting policyComment: If the Germans can come to the Cenotaph, why not the Rhodesians?Find the right newsletter for youSerious and organised crime \u0026#39costs UK economy £37bn a year\u0026#39Divers recover Lion Air jet\u0026#39s flight recorder on Indonesia seafloorComment: Yemen is on the brink of collapse, and calls for a ceasefire are welcomeFears over pre-teens being exposed to inappropriate adverts online, as regulators step up controlsNHS needs #Metoo moment to stamp out sexual harassment, doctors\u0026#39 union saysComment: We must act now to end the flow of criminal cash across our countrySouth Korea court allows conscientious objection to military servicePrince of Wales: I warned of plastic danger 40 years ago but was dismissed as \u0026#39out of touch\u0026#39Donald Trump suggests 15,000 troops could be sent to US-Mexico border to counter migrant caravans Britain is “medicalising” children rather than bringing them up properly, the head of the health service has saidColombian kidnappers demand ransom for Garcia Marquez relativeHarvey Weinstein accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girlMinister on brink of quitting over delay in cutting stakes for \u0026#39crack cocaine\u0026#39 gambling machinesMichel Barnier under mounting pressure to compromise with Britain over Irish backstopEssex seaside village outraged after being used in pro-Trump campaign advertComment: This is the radical Brexit speech Theresa May could still make Secret service to testify on \u0026#39political paedophiles\u0026#39 at child abuse inquiryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 1 november 2018","story":"A man works on electric machine parts at a workshop of an equipment manufacturing company in Weifang, Shandong province, ChinaComment: If the Germans can come to the Cenotaph, why not the Rhodesians?Find the right newsletter for youSerious and organised crime \u0026#39costs UK economy £37bn a year\u0026#39Divers recover Lion Air jet\u0026#39s flight recorder on Indonesia seafloorComment: Yemen is on the brink of collapse, and calls for a ceasefire are welcomeFears over pre-teens being exposed to inappropriate adverts online, as regulators step up controlsKim Jong-un condemns sanctions as the work of ‘hostile forces’NHS needs #Metoo moment to stamp out sexual harassment, doctors\u0026#39 union saysComment: We must act now to end the flow of criminal cash across our countrySouth Korea court allows conscientious objection to military servicePrince of Wales: I warned of plastic danger 40 years ago but was dismissed as \u0026#39out of touch\u0026#39Donald Trump suggests 15,000 troops could be sent to US-Mexico border to counter migrant caravans Britain is “medicalising” children rather than bringing them up properly, the head of the health service has saidColombian kidnappers demand ransom for Garcia Marquez relativeHarvey Weinstein accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girlMinister on brink of quitting over delay in cutting stakes for \u0026#39crack cocaine\u0026#39 gambling machinesMichel Barnier under mounting pressure to compromise with Britain over Irish backstopEssex seaside village outraged after being used in pro-Trump campaign advertComment: This is the radical Brexit speech Theresa May could still make Secret service to testify on \u0026#39political paedophiles\u0026#39 at child abuse inquiryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/31/TELEMMGLPICT000003160366_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1TJOa7BZ2Re4vzncv8bVrxi4GB-4tR5Il4FFM2mWZkk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"remembrance sunday reconciliation should not stop germany","story":"Let relatives of soldiers from the former Rhodesia honour their Great War fallen at the Cenotaph​ On Remembrance Sunday, which this year marks the centenary of the end of the Great War, more than 100 people, including war veterans and their supporters, are due to gather on the north side of Westminster Abbey for a military parade.

Within a few years, it would be worth more than $10 billion and would eventually peak above $300 billion – surpassing the market cap of the payments giant Visa.Yet despite this success, bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have since appeared are still largely a fringe technology, unable to truly break into the mainstream.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWhile bitcoin has taken off and is seen as the leader of the cryptocurrency market, it’s been adopted by the few not the many, said Chakib Bouda, chief technology officer at US-based payments firm Rambus.Confusion amongst users has played a part, but arguably the biggest failings for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past years lies with security, in the first six months of 2018 alone over $761 million bitcoin was stolen, with experts predicting that the amount stolen from exchanges will top $1.5 billion by the end of the year.The key to overcoming this issues, Bouda\u0026nbspsuggested, is keeping the private keys needed to access and use cryptocurrency funds both secure and easy-to-use.\u0026nbsp One way of doing this would be adopting technology used within the traditional financial sector to bring cryptocurrencies up to the levels of security and usability that people expect of a modern currency.Once this secure ecosystem is in place, it’s going to transform how many sceptics view bitcoin transactions, Bouda said. So whilst cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been described as the ‘Wild West’ by the UK treasury, we expect in 10 years’ time, bitcoin will become mainstream and have a remarkably different reputation.If bitcoin is able to transform its reputation in this way, bitcoin could find its way into everyone\u0027s pockets through mobile wallets –achieving\u0026nbspmainstream adoption\u0026nbspin time for bitcoin\u0027s next\u0026nbspbirthday.It\u0027s a view shared by Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of the online trading platform eToro. The next decade could see bitcoin being accepted as the norm when it comes to money transfer and payments, he said. As with any startup idea, early days are always risky, but I feel these are now few and far between.Alternatively, if another cryptocurrency is able to become a safe and\u0026nbspconvenient payment method\u0026nbspbefore bitcoin developers implement the necessary technology, bitcoin\u0027s place as the world\u0027s most popular cryptocurrency could be usurped.This is the view of Nigel Green, founder and CEO of the deVere\u0026nbspGroup, a financial consultancy firm based in London. Mr Green suggested that bitcoin\u0027s influence will drastically reduce in the cryptocurrency sector, however the overall crypto market will expand by at least 5,000 per cent.“Bitcoin is what kickstarted the crypto revolution and it has changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets, amongst other things, forever.\u0026nbsp It all began with bitcoin, Mr Green said.\u0026nbsp“However, whilst I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that\u0026nbspbitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade.\u0026nbspThis is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organisations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for bitcoin and dent its market share.He continued: “In addition, it is likely that bitcoin will be hit by the superior technology, features, and problem-solutions, offered by existing and yet-to-be-released cryptocurrencies.”If the deVere\u0026nbspCEO\u0027s forecast is correct, the boost from\u0026nbspmajor institutional and retail investors will see the cryptocurrency market rocket towards\u0026nbspthe $20 trillion mark by 2028.Financial institutions and regulators, amongst others, understand that cryptocurrencies are the future of money, he concluded.\u0026nbsp“As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If you don’t like the policies we’re using to achieve our objectives let me know and we’ll discuss them. If there’s another way that’s more pragmatic we’ll do it.’Click to followThe IndependentLabour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has told finance chiefs there is “nothing up my sleeve” and even offered to alter the party’s policies in response to their advice.Mr McDonnell met with a group of representatives of financial firms and other companies in the heart of the City of London on Wednesday as part of the shadow chancellor’s ongoing efforts to overcome the deep distrust – and often outright hostility – of the business sector towards the opposition party and its leadership.Labour’s nationalisation plans as dangerous as hard Brexit, says CBI“All the asset managers, the bank managers – what we’ve been saying is that what you’ll get from us is certainty. There’s nothing up my sleeve,” he told journalists.“Goldman Sachs came to see me about Brexit. I met people like\u0026nbspSchroders, because of their influence on shareholders. I’ve been meeting with some pension funds themselves – a whole range of people.”“For me a lot of it is listening to their ideas and long term plans. I say, ‘come in and advise us. Here’s our objectives, if you’re not keen or if you don’t like the policies we’re using to achieve those objectives, if there’s another way of achieving those objectives let me know and we’ll discuss them. If there’s another way that’s more pragmatic we’ll do it.’”Mr McDonnell, who once listed one of his interests as “generally fermenting the overthrow of capitalism”, argued that Labour was offering more certainty to businesses than the Conservatives, whose policy of leaving the single market and customs union and countenancing of a “no-deal”\u0026nbspoutcome is a source of profound concern for business.“What they’re not getting back from the Government is certainty about Brexit – but also certainty about where the Government is going on a number of inidual domestic policies as well,” he said.Despite Mr McDonnell’s attempts to build bridges, Labour\u0026nbsphas had an extremely\u0026nbspfractious relationship with business.Last year the CBI’s director general said that the party’s nationalisation agenda and suggestion that existing PFI contrasts could be simply torn up would “send investors running for the hills”.And the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, took pride 12 months ago when an analyst at the Wall Street bank, Morgan Stanley, said a Labour government was a risk to investors.“When they say we’re a threat, they’re right. We’re a threat to a damaging and failing system that’s rigged for the few,” Mr Corbyn said in a social media video message.Earlier that year, Mr McDonnell said Labour had a “scenario plan” for a run on the pound in the immediate wake of a Labour election victory, although he added that he did not think a currency collapse was likely.Asked about the possibility of Labour supporting a second referendum on Wednesday, Mr McDonnell said that Labour would push first for a general election.\u0026nbsp“If they won’t give us a general election, yes, there’s a potential for another vote and Parliament will decide what’s on that ballot paper.

If you don’t like the policies we’re using to achieve our objectives let me know and we’ll discuss them. If there’s another way that’s more pragmatic we’ll do it.’Click to followThe IndependentLabour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has told finance chiefs there is “nothing up my sleeve” and even offered to alter the party’s policies in response to their advice.Mr McDonnell met with a group of representatives of financial firms and other companies in the heart of the City of London on Wednesday as part of the shadow chancellor’s ongoing efforts to overcome the deep distrust – and often outright hostility – of the business sector towards the opposition party and its leadership.Labour’s nationalisation plans as dangerous as hard Brexit, says CBI“All the asset managers, the bank managers – what we’ve been saying is that what you’ll get from us is certainty. There’s nothing up my sleeve,” he told journalists.“Goldman Sachs came to see me about Brexit. I met people like\u0026nbspSchroders, because of their influence on shareholders. I’ve been meeting with some pension funds themselves – a whole range of people.”“For me a lot of it is listening to their ideas and long term plans. I say, ‘come in and advise us. Here’s our objectives, if you’re not keen or if you don’t like the policies we’re using to achieve those objectives, if there’s another way of achieving those objectives let me know and we’ll discuss them. If there’s another way that’s more pragmatic we’ll do it.’”Mr McDonnell, who once listed one of his interests as “generally fermenting the overthrow of capitalism”, argued that Labour was offering more certainty to businesses than the Conservatives, whose policy of leaving the single market and customs union and countenancing of a “no-deal”\u0026nbspoutcome is a source of profound concern for business.“What they’re not getting back from the Government is certainty about Brexit – but also certainty about where the Government is going on a number of inidual domestic policies as well,” he said.Despite Mr McDonnell’s attempts to build bridges, Labour\u0026nbsphas had an extremely\u0026nbspfractious relationship with business.Last year the CBI’s director general said that the party’s nationalisation agenda and suggestion that existing PFI contrasts could be simply torn up would “send investors running for the hills”.And the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, took pride 12 months ago when an analyst at the Wall Street bank, Morgan Stanley, said a Labour government was a risk to investors.“When they say we’re a threat, they’re right. We’re a threat to a damaging and failing system that’s rigged for the few,” Mr Corbyn said in a social media video message.Earlier that year, Mr McDonnell said Labour had a “scenario plan” for a run on the pound in the immediate wake of a Labour election victory, although he added that he did not think a currency collapse was likely.Asked about the possibility of Labour supporting a second referendum on Wednesday, Mr McDonnell said that Labour would push first for a general election.\u0026nbsp“If they won’t give us a general election, yes, there’s a potential for another vote and Parliament will decide what’s on that ballot paper. But there’s a lot of stages to go before that. We think there’s a deal to be had if the Government sensibly negotiates.”Mr McDonnell’s meeting took place at the headquarters of the global media group Bloomberg, close to the Bank of England. Among the finance groups listed as invited were Aviva, Prudential and the Investment Association, as well as representatives from Pfizer, Skanska, John Lewis, Virgin Media and the Crown Estate.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Financial Conduct Authority said it is concerned that general insurance pricing practices “have the potential to cause harm to consumers, particularly those who are vulnerable”.The watchdog said supervisory work on home insurance had uncovered a number of issues that “could cause harm to customers”, including\u0026nbspfirms failing to have appropriate or clear pricing strategies, governance and controls.Banks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEStudents targeted by ‘ghost brokers’ selling fake car insuranceInsurers criticised for failing mental health sufferersAndrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “Our initial work has identified a number of areas of potential consumer harm. We want to make sure that general insurance markets deliver competitive and fair prices for all consumers. “This market study will help us examine the outcomes from general insurance pricing practices and inform how, if necessary, we should intervene to improve the market.“If change is needed to make the market work well for consumers, we will consider all possible remedies to achieve this.”Gareth Shaw,\u0026nbspmoney expert at Which?, said: “This review is long overdue. For years, loyal policyholders have been exploited by insurance providers, punished by excessive premiums, and have had to battle with unclear pricing that makes it difficult for people to understand whether or not they’re getting a fair deal. “Customers who prefer to stay with one provider are at risk of being hit with vastly overpriced premiums when little has changed in the service they receive. It’s right that the regulator tackles this sector to ensure customers aren’t punished for their loyalty and that pricing is clear and transparent across the industry.”Georgie Frost, consumer advocate at GoCompare, said the investigation was welcome “because clearly something isn’t right and people feel they are being ripped off”. \u0026nbsp“Clearer rules and regulations will be better for everyone because we can’t have a system where it is the most vulnerable that are the hardest hit,” she said.“Equally, some people who can switch aren’t doing so and we need to find out why and make sure they are fully engaged.“The ‘tease and squeeze’ approach to pricing is the go-to tactic in many industries, including car and home insurance. New customers are enticed with a competitive price and then, if they don’t shop around and switch, they face often stealthy – sometimes blatant – premium increases in subsequent years.“It’s imperative that people keep shopping around and switching to avoid getting ripped off, but more also needs to be done to make it clearer how customers can switch.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She called on the government to introduce a compulsory register for children who are in home education, warning that\u0026nbspsome parents use home education as a “guise” for illegal schools.Ms Spielman also acknowledged that cuts to further education funding have affected the quality of the provision\u0026nbspand she called on the government to increase spending on the post-16 sector.However on schools funding, she wrote that while “funding is a major topic of concern in the sector ... inspectors are not seeing an impact on education standards”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters block Parliament Square in London as the environmental group Extinction Rebellion launches a mass civil disobedience campaign demanding action on climate changeBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, right, listens to Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, center, flanked by Lithuania\u0027s Health Minister, Aurelijus Veryga at the Oslo Cancer Cluster for a summit to discuss the role of health technology.

The Financial Conduct Authority said it is concerned that general insurance pricing practices “have the potential to cause harm to consumers, particularly those who are vulnerable”.The watchdog said supervisory work on home insurance had uncovered a number of issues that “could cause harm to customers”, including\u0026nbspfirms failing to have appropriate or clear pricing strategies, governance and controls.Banks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEStudents targeted by ‘ghost brokers’ selling fake car insuranceInsurers criticised for failing mental health sufferersAndrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “Our initial work has identified a number of areas of potential consumer harm. We want to make sure that general insurance markets deliver competitive and fair prices for all consumers. “This market study will help us examine the outcomes from general insurance pricing practices and inform how, if necessary, we should intervene to improve the market.“If change is needed to make the market work well for consumers, we will consider all possible remedies to achieve this.”Gareth Shaw,\u0026nbspmoney expert at Which?, said: “This review is long overdue. For years, loyal policyholders have been exploited by insurance providers, punished by excessive premiums, and have had to battle with unclear pricing that makes it difficult for people to understand whether or not they’re getting a fair deal. “Customers who prefer to stay with one provider are at risk of being hit with vastly overpriced premiums when little has changed in the service they receive. It’s right that the regulator tackles this sector to ensure customers aren’t punished for their loyalty and that pricing is clear and transparent across the industry.”Georgie Frost, consumer advocate at GoCompare, said the investigation was welcome “because clearly something isn’t right and people feel they are being ripped off”. \u0026nbsp“Clearer rules and regulations will be better for everyone because we can’t have a system where it is the most vulnerable that are the hardest hit,” she said.“Equally, some people who can switch aren’t doing so and we need to find out why and make sure they are fully engaged.“The ‘tease and squeeze’ approach to pricing is the go-to tactic in many industries, including car and home insurance. New customers are enticed with a competitive price and then, if they don’t shop around and switch, they face often stealthy – sometimes blatant – premium increases in subsequent years.“It’s imperative that people keep shopping around and switching to avoid getting ripped off, but more also needs to be done to make it clearer how customers can switch.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The smaller 11-inch takes up the same size as the existing 10.50-inch, using the extra space from the smaller bezels to pack in a bigger display the bigger 12.9-inch is the same screen size but has been reduced overall.Inside, it includes Apple\u0027s latest A12X bionic chip, which is an upgraded version of the processor in the iPhone XS and XR. It said that and other upgrades allow the new Pro to rival the Xbox One S for gaming performance, which it displayed by showing the latest version of the NBA 2K series.As well as those changes, Apple also swapped out the Lightning port that has traditionally been on the bottom of the iPad. In its place comes a USB-C port, which means that the tablet can be plugged into accessories like cameras or musical equipment – as well as charging the iPhone.The new iPads are available to order now, ahead of their full release on 7 November. The smaller one costs $769 or the same number of pounds, and the bigger one is $969.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Christine Manby\u0026nbspshares a cup of tea\u0026nbspunderground with\u0026nbspthe free miners of\u0026nbspthe Forest of DeanClick to followThe IndependentThere are only seven working coal mines in the Forest of Dean and the average age of the free miners edges ever higherMy guide Iain Jamieson is applying mindfulness techniques to a situation I never thought to find myself in. It’s a Tuesday evening in October, deep in the Forest of Dean. It’s a clear night. The smell of autumn is in the air. Stars gaze down on woodland alive with animals unseen. Drinking tea made on a coal-burning stove in the middle of a small secret clearing, while the notorious local wild boar lurk nearby, feels like a big enough adventure for me.But now I’m at the bottom of Morse’s Level, a Victorian coal mine, crawling my way to the seam. For a while, the tunnel is high enough to stand in, then it shrinks away to two-thirds my height. I’ve been banging my head with alarming frequency. I’m not sure if I’m delirious from adrenaline or concussion. I don’t think I can fold myself any smaller but we’ve reached the entrance to a long shaft barely wider than the shoulders of man-mountain Iain. The shaft follows a sharp incline upwards. The seam is at the other end of it.Iain’s fellow miners Adam Taylor and Paul Baverstock have gone on ahead. Their helmet lamps illuminate the way as they look down on us. The dull brown sandstone walls, floor and ceiling are slick with moisture. The wooden posts lining the tunnel look suddenly insubstantial. Small stones skitter down the chute as the men shift position above. If this were a film, it would be the harbinger of a landslide.Ghosts of past mining disaster still haunt the Welsh valleys“It opens out at the top,” Adam tells me.\u0026nbspI’m beginning to understand that “opens out” is a relative term down here. I can see he is almost bent double. “Start by putting your left knee up on the ledge,” he suggests. “Then grab that post and pull yourself in.”“I can’t,” I say, collapsing on to my backside on the muddy clay floor.\u0026nbspI look back along it in the direction we came. I can’t see anything beyond the circle cast by my lamp. I certainly can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.Iain, whose head almost touches the ceiling though we’re squatting like yogis, gets down on all fours. “You can stand on my back,” he says.The thought of using him as a footstool makes me feel ashamed and I make one last effort to haul myself into the shaft, channelling Shelley Winters facing the flooded engine room in\u0026nbspThe Poseidon Adventure. Grunting with the effort, I drag myself forwards. As I scramble up, another film scene flashes into my mind. The ghost girl climbing the walls of the well in\u0026nbspThe Ring Two, using her knees and elbows. It makes me move much faster.Created with Sketch.Free mining in the Forest of Dean Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mike deep in the minePhil gets ready for a session in the mineIain, John and Rob work on the surfaceJohn adds hot water to the Assam teaIn the mine it’s wet and muddy most of the yearEdward, solid, six foot and broad, working undergroundTruggs (buckets) filled with coalCandle power: the original miners’ light sourceInside the workers’ hutIain and Adam grade the coalEveryone works together as a teamMike deep in the minePhil gets ready for a session in the mineIain, John and Rob work on the surfaceJohn adds hot water to the Assam teaIn the mine it’s wet and muddy most of the yearEdward, solid, six foot and broad, working undergroundTruggs (buckets) filled with coalCandle power: the original miners’ light sourceInside the workers’ hutIain and Adam grade the coalEveryone works together as a teamAs I suspected, there is no “opening out” at the top. I can’t sit up. The ceiling is horribly close and looks bloody heavy. But Adam and Paul have prepared a special treat for me. A lump of coal stands proud of the seam. Everything around it is already chipped away so that it will fall with one good whack. Paul hands me a pick.“Give it some welly.” I\u0026nbspgive it some serious welly but the only thing that happens is I get a shower of cold wet coal chips in the face. I drop an F-bomb.“She speaks French,” someone observes.\u0026nbspI speak some more French until the chunk finally falls at my feet. I can find nothing but more expletives to describe the delight of it.“There you are,” says Iain. “That coal you’re holding hasn’t been seen for millions of years. Three hundred million years. And more people have stood on the top of Everest than have been down here and seen this.”He reminds me to look around. This is a view I may not see again. I take a proper look at the seam, 50 centimetres thick, glittering darkly. It’s as strange and wondrous as any mountaintop. The lump of coal I’ve liberated is the size and shape of a travel iron and jagged like a flint. I’m taking it home.\u0026nbspThen Adam tells me how we’re going to get back to the surface. He points out our exit. “Stick both your arms through first, like you’re ing.”Looking at an opening barely bigger than the hole at the centre of a loo seat, I see my own personal Everest may still be ahead of me.\u0026nbspThe Forest of Dean coalfield, which lies beneath the Forest of Dean,\u0026nbspnestled between the rivers Severn and Wye, is one of Britain’s smallest coalfields. It is\u0026nbspunique\u0026nbspfor the practice of free mining, which is vastly different to industrial mining. The free\u0026nbspmining of coal, stone and iron ore in the forest region predates the Romans it\u0026nbspis a practice that is deeply tied to place, and requires\u0026nbspa specialist knowledge of the land and its archaeology.Free mining originated in the reign of Edward I. In the 13th\u0026nbspcentury, miners played an important part in many of Edward’s military campaigns. After a hundred men from the forest helped end the siege of Berwick-upon-Tweed by undermining the castle with their tunnelling, Edward rewarded them with “free mining” status, bestowing upon them the right to mine anywhere in the forest (except beneath churchyards, orchards and gardens).To become a free miner, you had to be born within the St Briavels Hundred (pronounced St Brevels), the boundaries of which roughly corresponded to the boundaries of the forest itself. You had to be male, be over 21, and to have worked in someone else’s mine for a year and a day. You could then apply to the crown’s representative, the deputy gaveller (perhaps a corruption of “gale giver”), to take out what is known as a “gale”. According to a document dated 1673, a gale was defined thus: “The miner shall have as much space to work and store his materials as he can throw a stone.”Mining has long been at the heart of the Forest of Dean’s industry. Not just coal but iron ore, stone and ochre. By the 19th century, there were more Foresters working underground than above it. There’s even a theory that the impenetrable Forest accent has its origins in the mine, from when candles were still the only light source. How do you carry a candle when you need both hands free to crawl through a tiny shaft or chip away at a seam? The solution? A sticky and a nelly. A sticky was, quite literally, a stick. The nelly was a piece of clay moulded into a candleholder at the end of that stick, which the miner would then hold in the corner of his mouth to light the coal face as he worked. Try saying anything while holding a stick in the corner of your mouth. You’re talking Forest of Dean.Half a millennium after Edward\u0026nbspI,\u0026nbspwhen the Industrial Revolution led to an increased demand for iron and coal, the free miners came into conflict with powerful outside mining interests eager to exploit the forest’s reserves. To protect the miners, the Dean Forest (Mines) Act of 1838, restated the free mining rules. That same year, free miner George Morse, took out the gale that would become Morse’s Level.Today, Morse’s Level and its sister mine, Wallsend, are headed up by Mike Howell and Phil Schwarz, both Foresters born and bred. Phil’s grandfather and great-grandfather were both miners. Mike also comes from a mining family. His father was deputy gaveller.\u0026nbspHis son Daniel currently holds the role.\u0026nbspMike and Phil, both white-haired and now in their sixties, were school friends and caving buddies.\u0026nbspThey didn’t follow their forefathers straight into mining but took it up as hobby in the 1970s. They took over Morse’s Level – where they had volunteered – in 1978. “You could call it a management buyout,” Mike says. They went to mining college to learn about safety and explosives and get their deputies’ papers.All the men who work Morse’s Level and Wallsend today are volunteers. Their day jobs vary widely. Paul is an engineer, specialising in the removal of asbestos. He’s worked all over the world and has a hair-rising collection of stories about asbestos found in public places. Ed Morgan Dyer, who hails from the Welsh Valleys, is a cobbler. With an extravagant Edwardian-style moustache and an Australian miner’s hat, he certainly looks the part. Rob Rutsch maintains industrial printers for Xerox. Adam is an accountant. Like Mike and Phil, several of the men were cavers before they became miners. Paul is a member of the Gloucestershire Cave Rescue Group. What they all have in common is that after one trip down a mine they were hooked by the adrenaline and the weird magic of the coal seamThe men come to the mine on Tuesday evenings and all day on Saturdays. “When the missus allows.” On this particular Tuesday evening, back at Wallsend, the operational centre – AKA where the tea is made – there’s a cart full of coal ready to come to the surface.\u0026nbspThe men are proud of their new grading machine, rescued from a disused mine and refurbished and reassembled with care. A generator is fired up and a winch pulls the full cart out of the mine to a platform above the grader. John Smith and Adam stand at the top, ready to receive it.The miners don ear defenders and gather round. At the top, John and Adam scoop buckets from the cart. At the bottom, the others pluck bigger pieces from the belt before they can be shaken smaller. The rattling makes conversation impossible. Everyone concentrates hard on the job for the few noisy minutes it takes to empty the cart. At the end, the coal is separated into four grades. From the prized “lumpy” through “peas” to the very smallest parts, hardly more than dust, which could be pressed into briquettes. The miners are looking into the possibility of buying a machine to do just that.With the coal sorted, it’s time for tea. It doesn’t take long for the kettle to boil on the old stove in the hut. “This is steam coal,” Phil explains. “The kind they used in the trains. It gets so hot it can melt an iron grate.” An iron grate, buckled as though it were plastic, is presented as evidence.The tea is pure Assam. “Tesco’s Finest,” Adam points out, as he arranges the pristine mugs on a table in the open air.\u0026nbspTonight there’s homemade cake to go with the biscuits and the giant marshmallows that are a regular feature of teatime at Wallsend. On Saturdays, the day is broken with a run to the local chip shop for lunch. The jokes are gentle. Paul arrived early tonight. He used the opportunity to creep up on John, who was quietly mending a wall further up the hill, and impersonate a wild boar to frighten him.“I knew it was him all along,” John protests. \u0026nbspNobody wants to meet a real wild boar in the dark. Since a handful were illegally released into the forest in the 1990s, followed by another 60 in 2004, their number has swollen to more than a thousand. Earlier this year, a dog walker had the tip of his finger bitten off in a particularly unfortunate boar encounter. Everyone would prefer to see the otters, which Paul is certain have infiltrated the tunnels at Morse’s Level. He’s seen footprints in the mud underground. They might have come in via the culvert that occasionally floods the mine.\u0026nbspFrom boars to Brexit. The Forest of Dean voted “out” in the 2016 EU referendum. No one here was surprised. The perception of some locals is that EU immigration without a commensurate increase in funding for services has hit the forest hard. Paul describes how his wife waited four weeks to see a GP. He doesn’t blame EU migrants though. They’re only coming to work. They’re contributing too.Adam is pro-Brexit. He believes that EU tariffs keep the brakes on British business. He sees the evidence of it in his work in finance. Whatever they think of Adam’s view on trade tariffs, everyone agrees that the Brexit negotiations are a shambles.\u0026nbsp“No one over 65 should have been allowed to vote,” says Paul. One of the older guys at the mine tonight, Rob Rutsch, agrees. “It’s not our future that’s at stake,” he says. “It’s not going to affect us in the same way as it is the young people.”“Let’s talk about something else,” someone suggests. The conversation moves to organ transplantation and deemed consent. Once again, opinion is split. Paul thinks the system should remain as it is, with people happy to be donors opting in. Iain is for opt out.“When you’re dead, whatever it is that makes you you is gone,” he says.Inside the world\u0027s most beautiful coal mineDo they ever worry about dying in the mine? I wonder. I know I did, down there in the dark and the wet, knowing that if something happened, even if we got back to the surface, we were miles from the nearest town down a road that nobody drives unless they have to.Phil assures me there’s no need to worry. In the long history of the mines at Morse’s Level and Wallsend, only two people have been killed. “Hundreds of years ago.” Though Phil then recalls a recent nasty rock fall that completely blocked a tunnel the men had been working only hours before. “If it had happened while we were in there…” Then there’s the danger of flooding. And\u0026nbspblack damp.“Which isn’t damp at all,” Phil explains. “It comes from\u0026nbspdampf, the German word for vapour.” Phil’s father is Austrian.\u0026nbspBlack damp is an excess of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, which reduces the available oxygen in the air. It’s caused by poor ventilation and is a particular problem in mines that have lain unused for any length of time. Coal exposed to air begins to absorb oxygen. How do you know if you’ve got black damp? You can’t see it. You can’t smell it.There must be fancy alarms for it now, I suggest. Iain shows me the modern-day free miner’s method for staying safe. It’s remarkably low-tech. “You carry a candle,” he says. “So long as the flame stays good, you’re OK. It’s the perfect system. No batteries to run out.”Phil explains the other official safety measures. The mines are regularly visited by official inspectors. Meanwhile, in the hut is a panel from which dangle fobs carved with the names of every miner. “You’re supposed to move your fob from one end of the board to the other, to show that you’re down the mine so no one gets left behind. They’re always forgetting,” Phil tuts.\u0026nbspAbove the safety board, a garish effigy of Thatcher hangs by her neck from a nail.The conversation turns to other visitors. In the summer, a group of German miners dropped by. They brought German biscuits and an elaborate silver-headed ceremonial pick. A return visit is planned for next year. More recently, a descendant of George Morse came to the mine. His great-great-great granddaughter Makere Stewart-Harawira is a New Zealander of Forest, Scottish and Māori descent, currently living in Canada. When she visited the forest to find out more about her ancestry, the miners took her down to the seam at Morse’s’ Level.“She was a bit cagey about what it is she does,” says Phil. “Then we found out she’s a professor of climate change.”Specifically, she’s professor of indigenous, environmental and global studies,\u0026nbspsocial justice and international studies in education specialisation at the University of Alberta where her current area of research is described as “Intersections of Sustainability. Collaborative Research Network on Water Governance, Climate Change and Traditional Communities”.“She got emotional when she saw the mine though,” says Phil.It’s easy to understand why. The history in this place is palpable. At Wallsend, 200 miners once worked the seam. Not just men but women and children too. Many of the shafts were so small, they could only have been worked by kids. Twelve-hour days. Six days a week.\u0026nbspPaul talks about finding the print of a hobnail boot in a disused level and next to it a footprint. A bare footprint. A\u0026nbspchild’s\u0026nbspfootprint. Child labour was used extensively until it was made illegal in 1842. Even then, an 11-year-old was still counted as an adult. There were pit ponies at Wallsend too.“We’ve got a list of their names,” says Adam. “From when the mine was shut and they came up for auction. Some of them lived their whole lives underground.” There’s a moment of quiet. Half an hour on Morse’s Level was enough to leave me delirious. The idea of a lifetime. Never seeing the sun…It’s getting late. Adam fills a washing up bowl with more hot water. “Don’t forget your eggs,” he says, as other miners wash their hands and faces and get ready to go home. Adam and his wife keep rescue hens. They’re prolific layers. “I’m sick of eggs,” he says. The other miners have all come prepared with empty egg boxes to exchange for a fresh half dozen. Everyone assures me that the eggs are delicious and I’m thrilled to receive a box of my own.“Still got the shit on them though,” someone complains. “Where’s the swear box?” another miner asks.I think I owe the swear box more money than anyone else here tonight. There’s an underlying respect and old-fashioned gentleness in the way the men talk to each other, perhaps born of the fact that underground each man holds the other men’s lives in his hands. This is a true gentleman\u0027s club, I suggest. “More like Last of the Summer Mine,” says Iain.Later, in a nearby pub, Mike Howell expresses his concerns for the future. Morse’s Level and Wallsend have weathered centuries of change. The 1838 act that restated the free miners’ rights also allowed them to sell their gales to persons other than other free miners. It saw major industry swoop on the forest and introduce deep mining. By the 1920s, many of those mines were already deemed too expensive to be viable. The last deep mine was closed in 1965.When Labour nationalised coal in 1947, the rights of the free miners were recognised with a simple token licence system but with privatisation in 1994, the Coal Authority insisted that the free miners needed planning permission and tried to impose a new system that would have cost £2,000 per mine. With the help of the Forestry Commission and the deputy gaveller, the licence amount was reduced to £50 in 1997. All the same, the mines continued to close.Today there are only seven working coal mines in the Forest of Dean. The average age of the free miners edges ever higher. Meanwhile, the number of people eligible to take out a gale is falling as it gets harder to be born in the right place. The local maternity unit has been closed down and Mike talks of local women being “bullied” into having their babies at Gloucester Royal Hospital, some 15 miles away. In any case it seems the forest’s sons don’t wish to follow their fathers underground and though in 2010 Elaine Morman won the right to become the first female free miner (she mines ochre), she remains in a minority of one.The latest challenge to the centuries-old tradition isn’t financial or demographic. It’s environmental. Defra,\u0026nbspthe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is set to publish a comprehensive clean air strategy to further tackle air pollution, in anticipation of a new Clean Air Act. In preparation, Defra\u0026nbspseeks to “understand the impact of phasing out the sale of the most polluting mineral fuels, such as bituminous house coal”.Mike shows me an email he’s written to Defra, asking how a new Clean Air Act would impact the free miners in particular. “The Forest of Dean free miners’ acts and rights must be considered in any new arrangement... The coal we dig is not smokeless, and if we have no market for our coal then our ancient rights and the value of our coal reserves will be destroyed.“These reserves for each mine are valued at several million pounds per gale and this must be considered in any future government legislation. The protection of our rights is very important from a historical and monetary point of view.”Mike has never seen a penny of profit from Morse’s Level or Wallsend. “I do this for a couple of bags of coal a year,” he says.“If someone would just engage their brain about this act and see that there are still country communities which rely on coal. We’re not making as much pollution as 50 London taxis still running on diesel or one shipload of smokeless fuel coming from overseas. There are no air miles on our coal. They’re going to destroy our heritage for so little gain.”We’re not making as much pollution as 50 London taxis still running on diesel or one shipload of smokeless fuel coming from overseas. There are no air miles on our coalAt the very height of its output at the beginning of the 20th century, the Forest of Dean coalfield produced a million tonnes a year (out of a UK total of about 300 million). These days, Mike estimates that the total output of all the mines in the Forest is less than 500 tons a year. Phil has calculated that equates to 0.0000067 per cent of the world total.Defra\u0026nbsphas yet to respond.As the night draws to a close, Phil pulls out his iPad to look through his photographs of the mine through the years. The wifi in the pub is spotty but Phil eventually finds photographs of the auction catalogue with the list of names of the last pit ponies to have worked Wallsend. \u0026nbsp“Polly. Black Dolly. Kit. Beauty. Dolly. Spider. Darkey. Bessie. Mousey…”What became of them? I wonder. Did they go straight to another pit or did the auction mark the beginning of a better life above ground?\u0026nbspPhil brings up more photographs of the mine in its heyday. No Assam. No marshmallows. The faces of these miners are pinched and tired.\u0026nbsp“Me going down the mines when I don’t have to do it for a living,” Phil muses as the barman calls last orders. “My grandfather must be rolling in his grave.”Next day, the forest I’ve known since I was a child growing up in nearby Gloucester looks different. There’s a definite wisp of coal smoke in the air. But for how much longer? I wonder if free mining in the forest is facing an inevitable end. It’s simply out of time.Beavers returned to Forest of Dean after 400 years How South Wales is learning from community forests in ScotlandInside the world\u0027s most beautiful coal mineInterestingly, Makere Stewart-Harawira thinks not. In an email she told me: “My work, my research, my passion is about water, energy and the climate catastrophe that we are now in... And the worst culprit is coal… But here is what I know...\u0026nbsp“Free mining is also a small, local economy that helps maintain some of the families in the Forest of Dean today... There are ways of reducing the carbon emissions that are emitted in the local burning of these coals. Research regarding these methods, some of which involve processes for which the patents are now freely available… could be funded by the government as part of its commitment to carbon emission reduction as well as its commitment to supporting small local economies. The free mining activities of the Forest of Dean could potentially become one model for how we negotiate the tension between carbon emission reduction and the need to support local, autonomous economies. I’m passionate about helping to explore and promote that in any way that I can.”\u0026nbspI believe Professor Stewart-Harawira is right. The mines and the forest itself have a unique symbiotic relationship. This volunteer mining thing is not just “Last of the Summer Mine” as Iain had joked.\u0026nbspTo understand what it really means to mine the coal that has fired centuries of change is humbling. It’s a heritage worth honouring. The miners of Morse’s Level and Wallsend are preserving not only a tradition but also a genuine emotional connection to the people who went before them and to the very land itself. I think Phil’s miner grandfather would have been proud of him for that.Forest of Deanrights to mineShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu.Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on who’s able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be. It’s worth tidying this up to ensure things you no longer use lose access to your personal information. 89 Change your ad preferencesYou can view a list of everything Facebook thinks you’re into and tinker with your ad preferences by going to Settings and Adverts. A lot more information is displayed on the desktop site than the app, so we’d recommend doing this on a computer.99 Download your dataFacebook lets you download all of the data it has on you, including the posts you’ve shared, your messages and photos, ads you’ve clicked on and even the IP addresses that are logged when you log in or out of the site. It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.Mr Collins will work with Bob Zimmer, chair of the Canadian Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, to hold the hearing on disinformation and fake news.The hearing will be led by the UK committee and is scheduled to take place on 27 November.Facebook loses a million European users in three months“Each committee has separately sought evidence from Facebook over failures of process, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal,\u0026nbspand subsequent data breaches,”\u0026nbspa spokesperson for the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee\u0026nbspsaid. “A number of requests have been issued by the committee to Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence in person none has been successful.”In a letter sent by both Mr Collins and Mr Zimmer to the Facebook boss, they say they have been disappointed by his failure to appear in front of either parliament.“No such joint hearing has ever been held,” they write.\u0026nbsp”Given your self-declared objective to ‘fix’\u0026nbspFacebook, and to prevent the platform’s malign use in world affairs and democratic process, we would like to give you the chance to appear at this hearing.“We call on you to take up this historic opportunity to tell parliamentarians from both sides of the Atlantic and beyond about the measures Facebook is taking to halt the spread of disinformation on your platform, and to protect user data.”The letter requests that Mr Zuckerberg should respond\u0026nbspby 7 November.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Water ice clouds condense over the summit of the volcano, known as Asia Mons, and can be spotted spreading across the surface.Nasa Kepler Space Telescope dies after running out of fuelThe images were collected by the European Space Agency\u0027s\u0026nbspMars Express craft. They were first spotted in late September and have been tracked throughout October, allowing for hundreds of pictures.The white cloud stretches 1,500km over the surface of the planet – far bigger than the volcano itself – making it easy to see in images sent back from the spacecraft.Usually, the clouds disappear around this kind of year. Mars had its winter solstice on 16 October, and the clouds usually go before that.But a water ice cloud in this region has occurred at a similar time of year before, scientists say.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In those circumstances, I suggested the EU should begin preparatory work on the extension of Article 50.“Because what would not be a good thing in my view is if we managed to get a referendum but it was too late because we had left the EU or the EU had not made preparations for an Article 50 extension.”Mr Khan added: “Whatever Theresa May brings back will probably be rejected by cabinet, almost certainly rejected by the party, and if not will definitely be rejected by parliament.“That’s why I said to Michel Barnier: listen, you need to start preparing for the possibility of extending Article 50 because if that is the case we will need time to have a referendum.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I am charmed by the arrangement of their bodies and the shapes in which they are bonding. I realise the contemporary significance of the scene: the labyrinth - a complicated, irregular network of passages in which it is difficult to find one’s way - alongside the simplicity and closeness of human togetherness. In any complicated maze-like structure - Brexit included - it is important to remember that people and love and relationships are a vital part of the picture.Walking back into town from Leagrave High Street I notice two graffitied propaganda messages: ‘Free Gaza’ and ‘Beverly is a black cow’. Here are but two voices, I think, in the crazy cacophony of contemporary British discourse, of the British tongue, fractured as it is into accents, splintered by slangs, torn, in this case, into the libertarian and abusive, one dehumanising, one for freedom.University students hold a flash protest against the low pay of McDonald’s employees. They receive tuts, cheers, insults, whoops, raised eyebrows. People enter the restaurant in any case, unaware or uncaring that they have crossed a picket line.I went to look inside the Catholic Cathedral during Mass. I wanted to see the ritual and the practices, the people and their poses. There is a rich spectrum of visual dimensions to Catholic prayer that I first noticed when photographing in Poland. I’m attracted to its ambivalence: solemn and joyous lonely in dialogue desperate but determined solitary yet complete.Posters from the town’s glory days surround the Winter Gardens as it rusts and becomes overgrown. It seems like an intentional act to rekindle nostalgia in the face of disrepair, to balance the present with representations of the past.At the back of the central market hang three representations of conflict, side-by-side, connected, making sense in relation to one another. Only one message can be worn at any one time, but together they narrate a powerful image of modern Britain: a unified group, a club, an undefeated nation facing an existential threat from its enemies.People set up posts outside the train station, asking the town’s new arrivals for various things: religious missionaries seek attention and commitment a person sleeping rough asks for food and spare change. I’m interested in how this affects the visual experience of arriving in Luton and what the religious and the homeless look like when viewed in the same frame.A concoction of interests outside King’s College: a tourist desperately hailing lost members of the group a shopper takes a break from the high street a man sits to read a woman meditates with her identity concealed.A family emerges from the colours of Leagrave High Street. Twins sit and stare, identically, scrutinising me, like their father, perhaps. They are framed by rails of clothes. Mannequins exaggerate their life.A pop-up employment workshop opens for business in the town centre. The sign is heavily loaded with the values of modern Britain: one must aspire to achieve, earn, and live acquiring skills is akin to personal development the prioritisation of the ‘local’. A lady carrying water on a scooter - unconventionally, comically, skilfully - appears as a strange detail of everyday life passing such lofty visions.The Britannia Monument celebrates Horatio Nelson’s life. An acrobat fell from the top and died in 1863. It remains a mystery, a travesty for some, that Britannia - the monument’s embodiment of the nation - has her back to the sea. These days she turns her back on a single one-man tent too, a home, a shelter erected on the shore.This was the last scene I saw in the town. I was leaving. I thought of how child’s play, in its innocence and vitality, continues amidst our hunched, phone-tapping adolescence and adulthood.A couple and their dog relax by the Cathedral’s Labyrinth. I am charmed by the arrangement of their bodies and the shapes in which they are bonding. I realise the contemporary significance of the scene: the labyrinth - a complicated, irregular network of passages in which it is difficult to find one’s way - alongside the simplicity and closeness of human togetherness. In any complicated maze-like structure - Brexit included - it is important to remember that people and love and relationships are a vital part of the picture.Walking back into town from Leagrave High Street I notice two graffitied propaganda messages: ‘Free Gaza’ and ‘Beverly is a black cow’. Here are but two voices, I think, in the crazy cacophony of contemporary British discourse, of the British tongue, fractured as it is into accents, splintered by slangs, torn, in this case, into the libertarian and abusive, one dehumanising, one for freedom.University students hold a flash protest against the low pay of McDonald’s employees. They receive tuts, cheers, insults, whoops, raised eyebrows. People enter the restaurant in any case, unaware or uncaring that they have crossed a picket line.I went to look inside the Catholic Cathedral during Mass. I wanted to see the ritual and the practices, the people and their poses. There is a rich spectrum of visual dimensions to Catholic prayer that I first noticed when photographing in Poland. I’m attracted to its ambivalence: solemn and joyous lonely in dialogue desperate but determined solitary yet complete.Posters from the town’s glory days surround the Winter Gardens as it rusts and becomes overgrown. It seems like an intentional act to rekindle nostalgia in the face of disrepair, to balance the present with representations of the past.At the back of the central market hang three representations of conflict, side-by-side, connected, making sense in relation to one another. Only one message can be worn at any one time, but together they narrate a powerful image of modern Britain: a unified group, a club, an undefeated nation facing an existential threat from its enemies.People set up posts outside the train station, asking the town’s new arrivals for various things: religious missionaries seek attention and commitment a person sleeping rough asks for food and spare change. I’m interested in how this affects the visual experience of arriving in Luton and what the religious and the homeless look like when viewed in the same frame.A concoction of interests outside King’s College: a tourist desperately hailing lost members of the group a shopper takes a break from the high street a man sits to read a woman meditates with her identity concealed.A family emerges from the colours of Leagrave High Street. Twins sit and stare, identically, scrutinising me, like their father, perhaps. They are framed by rails of clothes. Mannequins exaggerate their life.A pop-up employment workshop opens for business in the town centre. The sign is heavily loaded with the values of modern Britain: one must aspire to achieve, earn, and live acquiring skills is akin to personal development the prioritisation of the ‘local’. A lady carrying water on a scooter - unconventionally, comically, skilfully - appears as a strange detail of everyday life passing such lofty visions.The Britannia Monument celebrates Horatio Nelson’s life. An acrobat fell from the top and died in 1863. It remains a mystery, a travesty for some, that Britannia - the monument’s embodiment of the nation - has her back to the sea. These days she turns her back on a single one-man tent too, a home, a shelter erected on the shore.This was the last scene I saw in the town. I was leaving. I thought of how child’s play, in its innocence and vitality, continues amidst our hunched, phone-tapping adolescence and adulthood.Millions of people every year visit them to discover and enjoy some of the most extraordinary collections assembled on this planet.Now, because of the ideological and half-baked way Brexit has been pursued, our museums face new costs, staff shortages, and may even have to close to the public.“Our museums are brilliant because they reflect an open outward-looking vision of the world where Britain has always thrived.

Labour will end the working-age benefits freeze if it wins power, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said.The shadow chancellor said the party would set out how it will pay for the move ahead of the next general election.“We will lift the freeze and we will make sure that from then-on people get a proper cost-of-living benefit on the freeze themselves,”\u0026nbspMr McDonnell told ITV’s Peston.\u0026nbsp”What we said is that we will lift the freeze and that from then-on people will get proper cost-of-living increases.\u0026nbspWhen we get into the next election we’ll set out our manifesto and we’ll set out a costed programme like I did last year as well.”Hammond’s business-as-usual Budget is its own form of extremismSellafield decommissioning ‘significantly’ delayed and over budgetChancellor faces anger as repairs bill for NHS hospitals hits £3bnLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised Theresa May at Prime Minister’s Question Time earlier this week for choosing a “tax cut for higher earners” in the Budget rather than ending the benefit freeze.\u0026nbspThen Tory chancellor George Osborne froze most working-age benefits in 2016.Mr McDonnell’s comments came as it emerged that his own party’s MPs\u0026nbspare planning to revolt against his support\u0026nbspand that of Mr Corbyn, for a Conservative tax cut that will mainly benefit top earners.Mr Corbyn has been warned that the move is “unacceptable” to many of his backbenchers ahead of a vote late on Thursday.The leadership will order its MPs to abstain in the vote, but Lisa Nandy, a respected former shadow minister, said many of her colleagues viewed such a tax cut for the rich as “immoral”.Yvette Cooper, David Lammy and Alison McGovern are among other Labour MPs who have criticised the move – a hike in the threshold before the 40p income tax rate kicks in to £50,000.Mr McDonnell has said he will not oppose the change because Labour is “not going to take money out of people’s pockets” and argued that party\u0026nbspwill only ask the top 5 per cent of earners to pay more, under planned increases in income tax rates that would kick in at £80,000.The clash sets up the extraordinary prospect of Labour MPs rebelling against Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell for failing to be radical enough on tax-and-spend.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Barack Obama, who will hold a rally for her in the state, and Oprah Winfrey will be out on the campaign trail for Ms Abrams as she runs against Republican Brian Kemp, the current Georgia Secretary of State. Winfrey, the\u0026nbspbillionaire media mogul, “has inspired so many of us through the years with her unparalleled ability to form real connections and strengthen the bonds of family and community, Ms Abrams said in a statement. Stacey Abrams does not want votes \u0027just because I\u0027m a black woman\u0027She added: I am honoured to have Oprah join me for uplifting and honest conversations with voters about the clear choice before us in this election and the boundless potential of Georgians.”Winfrey, who was born in Mississippi like Ms Abrams, will join the candidate at town halls in Marietta and Decatur, Georgia, as well as knocking on doors in the communities to ask for people’s votes. The presence of celebrities is nothing new on campaign trails but not often seen on in gubernatorial races, particular from stars who are not from the state. Earlier this week, Chicago-bred rapper, activist, and Grammy-winner\u0026nbspCommon joined the candidate at a “Souls to the Polls” rally\u0026nbspThe Independent attended in downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The event is meant to bring people from Sunday church services straight to the voting booth and several Georgia counties have allowed early voting to take place on Sundays leading up to the election. Common riled up the crowd with a verse: “If you don’t know what you’re willing to die for, what are you living for today? Hopefully, you’re living for freedom. Hopefully, you’re living for justice and equality. Hopefully, you’re living for more opportunities here in Georgia for every person, for people from all different types of backgrounds”. He hit on Ms Abrams central campaign tenet, repeated at events all over the state: “inclusion”. Georgia’s demographics are changing dramatically and it is set to be the first state in the South that is majority minority by 2025. Minority children are already the majority in the state with growing Asian and Hiic populations, particularly in the suburbs of Atlanta. “We’re all here together...and Stacey Abrams represents that love, that togetherness,” the Like Water for Chocolate artist said on stage.

As much as Barack Obama’s election meant a great deal for African-Americans in the south, Ms Abrams’ win would be important for black women. Several older black women The Independent encountered on the campaign trail, those who had lived through the pre-1965 Jim Crow era when segregation was enshrined in law, could be seen holding back tears as Ms Abrams spoke. Glenda Hatchett, the star of the television show Judge Hatchett, told The Independent “as a black southern woman I want to be very clear that Stacey’s candidacy is about inclusion,” adding: “We will have a governor for all of Georgia.” The Democratic candidate, who in her words grew up “working poor” in Mississippi and then “just plain poor” as her parents studied to become ministers at Atlanta’s Emory University, took to the stage to say: “I see of all of Georgia and I am running for all of Georgia”. She told a story she’s retold hundreds of times on the campaign trail, but it does not feel rehearsed. The audience laps it up as if they have never heard it before, a testament to her earnest delivery. Ms Abrams graduated as valedictorian of her high school in 1991 and said she was invited to the governor’s mansion along with valedictorians from all of Georgia’s 159 counties. “I was only mildly interested in meeting the governor and much more interested in seeing the mansion. I watched a lot of General Hospital and Dynasty as a child,” she joked. But, she does not remember meeting the governor that day. She only remembers the security guard outside telling she and her parents they do not belong “in the most powerful place” in the state because they were African-American and had just gotten off the public bus they had taken to get there.

That’s when I saw they were completely black, no iris, no white, nothing. I jumped back and grabbed my daughter. When I looked again, the child was gone. It was so strange.”Various paranormal experts have since investigated the area, with the YouTube channel Haunted Finders even managing to capture the ghost on camera in .Cemeteries are creepy places. But in the late s and early s there was an added spookiness to the decaying and decrepit Highgate Cemetery in North London, after numerous people reported sightings of a supernatural being.One was made by British Psychic and Occult Society member David Farrant, who wrote a letter to the Hampstead and Highgate Express claiming that he had seen “a grey figure” in the cemetery Christmas Eve .A handful of people claimed that they had also seen a tall, dark figure, floating behind the railings.These reports caught the interest of another local man Sean Manchester – a real-le vampire hunter – who believed that the ghostly figure was that of a Romanian ‘Vampire of the Undead’ that had been brought to England in the early s.Finally, after  years of hunting, Manchester published a book in which he claimed to have successfully staked, beheaded and burnt the vampire.But with no photo evidence, some believe the vampire could still be out there.While the ghost of the young girl in Cannock Chase ran away from people, there have been reports of ghosts who have attacked people in the UK, too.Greyfriars Cemetery in Edinburgh, Scotland, is home to a number of notable names, including Thomas Riddell – the inspiration Voldemort in JK Rowling’s Harry Potter books.But the cemetery is also home to one resident even more chilling than the Dark Lord himself.Sir George ‘Bluid’ MacKenzie was a th century lawyer who is blamed for the deaths of thousands of men during Charles II’s religious persecution of Presbyterians in Scotland - and his ghost still haunts the area to this day.MacKenzie laid undisturbed for more than  years before his spirit was reportedly first encountered in .A homeless man decided to take shelter in MacKenzie’s final resting place – the Black Mausoleum – on a dark and stormy night when something terrying happened.An ancient coffin allegedly collapsed beneath him, plunging him into a pit containing still decomposing plague victims, and the man ran from the scene covered in dust, startling a passerby that was out walking their dog.It is believed that the incident disturbed the spirit of MacKenzie,  and since then there have been more than  recorded incidents of poltergeist attacks on members of the public there.Volunteer guide Willie Telford told Edinburgh Evening News: “People have been bitten, scratched, kicked, pushed, they get burn marks, they feel sick, they feel cold.And it gets worse.Borley Rectory in Essex is widely regarded as ‘the most haunted house in England’.There have been reports of strange incidents at the Victorian house for decades, including sightings of a ghost nun and a phantom coach driven by two headless horsemen.But things really escalated in , when the resident Reverend Guy Eric Smith contacted a national newspaper to report otherworldly activity, including bells ringing and the sound of footsteps.The paper sent paranormal investigator Harry Price to carry out research, and the activity intensied, with reports including the throwing of vases and stones.The Smiths soon left the property, with the reverend’s we believing that Price had been behind it all. But the strange occurrences continued.Smith’s replacement, Reverend Lionel Algernon Foyster, also recorded incidents including bell-ringing, writing appearing on the wall and even his we, Marianne, being thrown from her bed by a poltergeist.The mystery remained unsolved and the house burnt down in  before being completely demolished five years later.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I’m happy to tell Sun on Sunday readers that their hard work is paying off.Our jobs market has defied many of the naysayers.Near record numbers of people have a job and unemployment has fallen in every region across the country.There are more than .million additional people in work since .While this is a huge achievement, sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind these numbers are thousands of people up and down our country who are now better able to provide for their families.They can get up every morning knowing they have the security that only a job can bring.And what’s more, they are being rewarded with a pay rise — this month’s figures show the strongest wage growth in almost a decade.Contrary to myths peddled by the opposition, it’s people at the bottom of the pay scale who have benefited most.The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest rise in pay thanks to our National Living Wage and the proportion of low-paid jobs is at a record low.Tomorrow I will deliver my Budget, where I will show how our careful focus on fixing the economy is bearing fruit.Thanks to the balanced approach we have taken — getting our debt falling, while keeping taxes low — and the hard work of the people of the UK, I will be able to set out how we will be investing in our future.Much of the talk surrounding Budgets is often technical. Many, many experts and commentators will have their own take on how the economy is doing.While this is, of course, important, what most ordinary people really care about is how the Budget will improve their day-to-day lives.And one of the issues which I know Sun on Sunday readers care a lot about is transport. With a thousand more people moving into work every day, it’s important that we help to get them there on time.Many of you preparing to start the working week tomorrow will know the frustration of having your journey to work ruined by delays caused by poorly maintained roads. Or of having your car or van damaged by potholes.This isn’t just a bad way to start the day, it’s bad for businesses large and small, and it can be really damaging to the wider economy as well.It’s estimated that congestion costs UK households more than £billion every year. That’s why tomorrow I will announce a bumper £billion investment in our country’s transport network — including a new £.billion fund ring-fencing vehicle excise duty raised in England for spending on our roads.As a former Transport Secretary, I know that these are the arteries that keep our country alive – and they need taking care of. Thirty-two years ago tomorrow, Margaret Thatcher officially opened the final stretch of the M.While few would claim to love this motorway, it’s easy to forget what a landmark moment this was for our country’s transport infrastructure. Three decades later, I am committed to honouring that legacy.And as important as our major roads are, smaller local roads are just as vital to our everyday lives.That’s why I will also announce tomorrow £million of immediate cash for councils to maintain and improve local roads — fixing potholes, repairing damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open.A further £million on top of that will help improve local junctions, allowing better access to workplaces, high streets and other community facilities.This is also part of our commitment to bridging the gap between our regions. Those in rural parts of the country should have the same chances to get on in le and not have poor transport connections limiting their potential.The funding will help make journeys quicker and easier, while boosting productivity and improving access.And because I know that not everyone drives, I will also invest in local transport projects which could include new bus, tram and cycling routes.And I will also look to the future by investing in next-generation methods of transport, which could potentially include self-driving shuttle services.Not only could this revolutionise our transport network, it will also help us become a global leader developing future technologies.And finally, as I earlier announced with the Prime Minister, I am happy to confirm we will also be freezing fuel duty, for the ninth year in a row.This will keep the cost of fuel down for millions of drivers across the UK — saving people around £million this year alone.These measures are only possible due to our careful management of the economy over the past few years — and the hard work of the British people.This country has a bright future ahead, and — thanks to this vital investment package — the journey there just got a bit smoother.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A seven-hour slog live from Westminster City Hall, presented by Adam Hills, Maya Jama and the network’s spare part Alan Carr, who set the tone for most of what followed interviewing Foxy from SAS: Who Dares Wins.“It’s been announced you’ve got a new Stand Up To Cancer series starting next year. Tell us about it.”“I can’t.”“Give us some names.”“I can’t.”No sooner had we written that one off than it become apparent there was no Bake Off special either — just a promo for a show that will be screened months from now. No matter, though. With its lofty public-serving hat on, Adam Hills faithfully promised Channel  would “educate, entertain and inspire” us for the remainder of the evening, which must have looked quite good written down.In practice The first thing to say about Stand Up To Cancer is that it featured some of the most beautul and affecting films you’ll see on a telethon.They needed to be, as well, ’cos you don’t have to have watched the event to know it contained a lot of feeble stunts and sketches.I also could have lived without Adam Hills carrying out a threat to have his pubic hair waxed, live, once the total reached £million, and the educational segment, with Katherine Ryan and Chris O’Dowd, which was sunk the moment he announced: “We’re goingto put the humour in tumour.”Tellingly, there was also a fair bit of non-network talent involved, including James Corden.I’ll not dwell, though, on what Channel ’s Twitter feed did to the Carpool Karaoke segment, where Michael Buble talked about his son’s illness, except to say it was one of those productions where the left hand wasn’t talking to the right.So when Chris O’Dowd was moved to tears talking about the cancer films, the studio audience was guffawing loudly at Alan Carr manoeuvring himself into background position in a Prue Leith wig.By a process of elimination and production gaffs, though, it became apparent the centre of Channel ’s entire universe now is Gogglebox, which had created an all-star version with Louis Tomlinson, Danny Dyer and daughter Dani for the occasion.They missed a trick, frankly, by not capturing Louis falling asleep to The X Factor. But it was still riotously funny watching the regulars pick apart Naked Attraction, with the choicest comment being: “That one looks like Homer Simpson’s mouth.”This was not the sound of people laughing with the channel, though. They were laughing at it.A network that was once known for being brave and innovative is now far more readily associated with a genital parade, third-rate reality shows and cakes than anything in the way of ground-breaking drama or comedy.In fact, the only two genuinely funny people on its payroll are probably Jimmy Carr and Sean Lock, who had to make way, at Stand Up To Cancer, for box-ticking randoms like Mo Gilligan, who was served this testicular curve-ball by Maya Jama.“Do you have a special name for your balls, by any chance ”He does.The Big Narstie Show.So there I was, gently drting off as Darcey Bussell went through the technical motions on Strictly. “The control in the rise and fall. Strong in the two-three.”When, unless I’m imagining it, she told Sean Walsh: “You have to smooth it out and iron it out, so it isn’t jerking off or skippy.”Suddenly I was all ears for the show’s Halloween special – an event which, for three good reasons, is usually my least favourite of the run.Firstly, Tess always expects a laugh for referring to it as a “spook-tacular”. Secondly, someone does The ****ing Timewarp. And thirdly, the worst danceris forced to jig around to The Monster Mash.We got it all, on Saturday night, of course, yet somehow it didn’t feel quite such an endurance as normal.This may have been partly down to Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer, who both danced like dreams, but it definitely owed something to the presence of Sean, who’s added real jeopardy to proceedings andactual comedy.His snog with Katya has made sense of a dreadful line-up and the BBC should be eternally grateful to The Sun and the photographer for capturing the moment.So although the handbag-clutchers will no doubt disagree, I was genuinely sad to see him voted off and probably back to the ex-girlfriend, where, in the words of Darcey Bussell, he’ll have to “smooth it out and iron it out” or he’ll end up, you know . . . “skippy”.Sandra Oh’s performance in Killing Eve.

There were announcements on schools funding, defence, moving “from disposable to reusable cups across all beverage types” — even a tax break for public loos. More money for social care and Universal Credit.Shopkeepers will breathe a sigh of relief at a hefty cut to business rates.There were hints of more money for the police. Sun readers will also welcome the tax freezes on beer, spirits, cider and short-haul flights.But the big bucks — some £.billion of the £.billion extra the Government expects to spend come - — went to the NHS, fulfilling the Prime Minister’s summer promise to increase spending as a th birthday present to a health service creaking under the strain of an ageing population.The question, of course, was how the Chancellor was going to pay for it.Before the Budget, all sorts of grim possibilities had been floated.Extra taxes on white-van men, lower- ing the VAT threshold and tightening the rules about National Insurance contributions. Taxes on plastic cups . Taxes on pretty much anything, really.Perhaps the best thing the Chancellor did in his Budget, then, was say “No”.To almost all of it. For an hour or more, I waited for the sting in the tail — the bit where Fiscal Phil turned Hatchet Hammond.But it never came. In paying for his promises — and above all, the NHS — the Chancellor was helped by better-than-expected borrowing forecasts, which showed our economy’s remarkable record of creating jobs is still going strong.But he has also made a calculation that it is better to live with a small and manageable deficit than try to drag the finances back into surplus at the cost of higher taxes. And that voters will see through Labour’s promises to hike borrowing back to stratospheric levels in the name of a socialist transformation of the economy.He decided, in other words, people pay enough tax already.And he’s right. All too often in recent years, it has felt like the answer to every problem — at least from Whitehall’s point of view — is higher taxes and more interference.Hammond was never going to copy his tax-slashing Tory predecessor Nigel Lawson, who made it a point of principle to abolish a dferent tax with every Budget.But at least he drew a line in the sand, deciding it is better when hardworking people get to keep more of their own money.That ending austerity should not, and must not, mean higher tax bills. That hard work should mean hard cash in your pocket.Yes, Hammond — like every Chancellor since Gordon Brown — made too many fiddly little announcements.But he avoided the kind of whacking- great raid on taxpayers’ pockets so many were urging him towards.This doesn’t mean we are out of the woods. Britain’s growth prospects over the next half-decade are still extraordinarily sluggish.The outcome of the Brexit deal will drastically change the fiscal picture.In many ways, Hammond’s speech yesterday was a holding action ahead of the much bigger decisions to come.We still need much more radical action to kickstart growth and productivity. Despite the scale of the housing crisis, for example, there was only tinkering around the edges.But a large part of delivering that growth must involve making the economy more dynamic, more competitive and letting people keep more of their own money as a reward for their efforts — moving the country in the direction outlined by Philip Hammond, rather than the one sketched out by Jeremy Corbyn .The overall verdict on the Budget  The jokes were worse than expected but the numbers were better.More spending on the NHS, tax cuts for millions of voters and the worst ideas kept out of it.Yes, borrowing will be higher — but low enough to keep us out of the danger zone and far, far lower than under a Corbyn government.That is a menu Philip Hammond will be pretty happy with.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Another £.billion to iron out Universal Credit problems. A near five per cent hike in the minimum wage. A big, welcome cut in business rates for struggling firms.New ideas flowed: a levy on web giants’ UK revenues, potentially raising £million, is long overdue — though Philip Hammond must ensure the ­burden does not fall on online shoppers.There was major funding to help councils transform our hollowed-out High Streets, including turning vacant shops into homes. A huge increase in firms’ annual investment allowance will let them deduct from taxable profits up to £million spent on tools and machinery.Heathrow’s e-gates will now speed up entry for visitors from the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan as well as Europe — a symbol of a global Britain open for business.Some bad ideas The Sun has criticised, including the proposed “latte levy” on plastic cups, were binned. Duty was frozen again on fuel, as well as beer.Even the OBR’s normally pessimistic forecasts were on Mr Hammond’s side. Growth is predicted to rise steadily, albeit too slowly. Unemployment is set to fall to its lowest in  years.We wish the Chancellor had outlined more radical, visionary low-tax measures. He will need them should Brussels shove us into a no-deal Brexit. But that gripe aside, what was not to like The Tories must not try to ape Corbyn’s £trillion spending fantasy. But it is not “Corbyn-lite” to spend billions fixing Britain’s most pressing problems, evenwe are still running a deficit.As for Corbyn himself, it was obvious he took in barely a word of the Budget.In his “response” he merely recited his normal scripted complaints, flubbing his words and shouting randomly, as is now traditional. He somehow contrives to make even this chaotic Government look like a model of competence.Budgets often unravel when acres of small print are finally scrutinised.But for now... nice one, Chancellor.ANGELA Merkel is a once-brilliant politician scuppered by an arrogant disregard for voters.For years she was admired worldwide.

Legend has it that he died in there, and his ghost still haunts the station today as he looks for a way out.Spectrum have been conducting investigations since , going into peoples haunted homes to help them with supernatural activity and running public ghost hunting events.Weve done a lot of investigations down here, says Hazel. Weve heard mysterious footsteps, knocking and banging.One day we even made contact with the spirit of a nine-year-old girl who spoke to us, I think she may have died in an accident when the tube station was still in use.While the pro hunters naturally have state of the art equipment, there are plenty of ghost hunting apps available for mobiles.Sun Online went underground with Spectrum for a special Halloween ghost hunt, pitting three iPhone apps against their specialist toolkit.And things certainly got spooky...Could Mr Brackett still be haunting the station today  Thats what Hazel, Dean and Sun Online are hoping to find out with our technology.During previous visits to the station, they have heard what they describe as poltergeist activity, including banging and footsteps, assomebody is trying to find their way out.Theyve also had positive responses when trying out ouija boards in the station.Weve called out his name in the past and got a few replies, him moving the board or knocking says Hazel.The building does have an extremely creepy atmosphere, which is heightened when you know its history.And Dean, who describes himself as a sceptic compared to Hazel who is a full believer in the paranormal, says doing investigations down here has opened his mind to the possibilities that there is something  out there.Hazel and Dean are kitted out with a box full of equipment, such as ious sound recorders, crucixes and even a ouija board, which they have bought from specialist shops and online.Tonight, they will be using a Meterk Meter, which uses an electro-magnetic fieldto seea presence is nearby and a Mel Meter  that measures EMF and temperature:a spirit is present people will often complain of a room going cold.They also have a K meter, which that can allow for communication from spooks by them manipulating the LED lights on the meter.The theory is, your soul carries on within electromagnetic fields, which is how spirits can communicate with us through these items, says Hazel.In Sun Onlines tool box are three iPhone apps.They are: Ghost Hunter M , Ghost Detect Proand Ghost Sensor , which is supposed to imitate the K meter.On first glance, the apps dont seem particularly great. They are packed full of ads, make a lot of weird bleeping noises and seem completely incomprehensible and impossible to use.And Im sceptical as to how an iPhone can even detect ghosts in the first place.When we ask Hazel what she thinks of the apps, she says theyre not as effective for ghost hunting as the experts equipment, as they can be affected by the phones own electrical fields.Shes right: as we walk round, not very much happens with the apps. Ghost Sensor does absolutely nothing, the needle remains still even when Deans K meter starts to spike.When I try out Ghost Detect Pro, I suddenly hear random words coming out of my phone: Wild! Grant! Fish!I wonderthis is a spirit trying to communicate, but Hazel assures me these are often randomised sounds assigned to the app for fun, which is a little bit disappointing.Our final room to try is a corridor with stairs leading up to the next level at the back of it. This, Hazel says, is the place where Spectrum have had the most activity.And it doesnt disappoint: Hazel and Deans equipment starts spiking and bleeping, and even the M app shows the EMF reading is jumping.The room suddenly falls extremely cold, before we hear it: somebody coming down the stairs very slowly, followed by banging sounds.With everyone accounted for, theres surely only one explanation for who it could be...If thats you, knock twice for yes, shouts Dean. And immediately, we hear two knocks coming from the other side of the room.To be honest, its so scary I forget to check my apps, but based on earlier I cant imagine they were doing very much.We wait to heartheres any more, but the weird atmosphere that had been in the room during the knocking lts, and Hazel whispers hes gone.Whether that was Mr Brackett or not, we will never know...Although I cant fully explain the spookiness down in disused station, or the footsteps and knocking we heard, I remain on the fence about ghosts.And as for the apps  Theyre best left to the professionals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will not feel that austerity is over.”Brits going onto the new system have said they are left waiting weeks and months for payment, and are being driven into debt.This week we told how a single mum is at risk of homelessness after falling behind with her housing payments under Universal Credit.Last week a damning report claimed that almost half were in debt within nine months of going onto the new system.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the International Development Secretary wants to loosen the strict rules further by allowing countries who are just above the threshold to qualy too.Currently Britain can only spend aid money on countries that have an average income per head of below £,.And we can’t send aid money to those countries even when they dip below the target again.But the rule change would allow those countries to once again become recipients of our aid moneyhumanitarian or economic disasters mean they fall below the World Bank High Income threshold.Countries that have fallen below the threshold since  after previously exceeding the threshold include Antigua and Barbuda, Equatorial Guinea and Venezuela.The strict rules - governed by the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee in Paris - stopped us using the bloated foreign aid budget on the reconstruction effort for Caribbean islands devastated by Hurricane Irma and Maria last year because the nations were deemed too wealthy.The tourism industry in the likes of St Lucia and the British Virgin Islands has taken a long-term hit by the tragedy. Britain had to use £ million from other government budgets to cover help with recovery.At the time of the hurricane there was no system in place for affected countries to requaly for aid.Hailing the victory, Ms Mordaunt told The Sun: “The British public are strong supporters of providing help in the wake of disasters, including long-term reconstruction. They want to help people, especially when they are from nations we have close ties to.“Not being able to pay for that help from the aid budget, because a nation’s economy was doing well, before a hurricane, earthquake or other disaster hit, was illogical and had to change.“Britain has never fallen short in our support of countries in need – either through sending aid, our Armed Forces or reconstruction support. This signicant rule change means that in future we may be able to use our aid budget to pay for that longer term, reconstruction support.“This gives the UK more options in how it can help a nation recover and become more resilient to shocks. I think the public would agree that is what our aid budget should be used for.“This is a major victory for the UK which has led the charge in securing this change.

Today he is calling on the public to help him.Many homeless people currently rely on donations given to them by the public in the street or on shytransport, for food and shelter. But too often cash is creamed off by criminals who exploit them. Some is blown by vulnerable rough sleepers on drugs or alcohol before, as intended, it can be spent at a hostel on a bed. Some money even ends up in the pockets of professional beggars whoto a warm home each night after a hard day’s scrounging. So today Mr Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is launching a project called A Bed Every Night to ensure the homeless are not just given emergency accommodation when temperatures plummet below freezing.The plan is also backed by Manchester City skipper Vincent Kompany, who is donating some funds from his testimonial year. But there’s a shortfall, shyestimated at around poundmillion, and Mr Burnham hopes the public can meet it. The mayor, who has pledged to shyeradicate rough sleeping in the region, said: “The best way to help people this winter is to give through the official routes rather than give on the street. “Not everybody out there in the day time is necessarily someone who will be sleeping rough at night. “The clear message is there are people out there using public shysentiment and concerns about homelessness – and trying to make money out of it. “I think there is a lot of money given that is not going to the right places.” Homelessness official Mike Wright said: “There are gangs, mainly lower level drug dealers, that prey on beggars and rough sleepers in Manchester.” He said some homeless victims even end up as drug-runners for the thugs. He added: “They allow them to have a ‘begging patch’ and not be beaten upthey do ‘this, this or this’. “They take their passports off them and their National Insurance number and say ‘you work for us’.”  At least  people are believed to be rough sleeping across the region. Last year’s Beast from the East meant day after day of sub-zero temperatures so more people took up emergency shyaccommodation for longer. There they were given extra assistance. Mr Burnham said: “There was a chance to give them the extra support which was more likely to keep them off the streets for good.” The mayor’s plan has been backed by businesses, charities, councils and volunteers. Already around  beds have been provided in night shelters, hostels and other accommodation, with more expected soon. Insisting the scheme is more than just a “sticking plaster”, Mr Burnham added: “We remain % committed to ending the need for rough sleeping by  and are on the verge of a massive step towards it with A Bed Every Night. “Our aim is to provide a place for every person sleeping rough from today right through to March .” He added: “Ideally, it will provide a steady base with a hot shower, hot meal and specialist support.”Visit www.bedeverynight"},{"url":null,"title":"prime ministers questions classic game","story":"NewsopinionPrime Ministers Questions was a classic game of two halves - Kevin Maguires verdictJeremy Corbyn won the first, demonstrating austerity isnt over but Theresa May hit back exploiting Labour confusion over tax cuts for higher earnersShareCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video kevin-maguire-reacts-fiery-pmqs-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTodays Prime Ministers Questions was a classic game of two halves.

In his resignation letter his insisted his friends and family were unaware of the charges - including his mum who spoke in his favour during the selection process when he was picked as a Labour council cabinet. Today Tory MP Simon Hoare expressed concern that someone convicted of drugs offences was able to hold on to his parliamentary pass which gives him access to the Houses of Parliament - but he did not name Mr Osamor. He said: We are all alert to the scourge of drugs in our towns and cities. But I also think the House would agreethe sins of the father and the mother cant be visited on the sons then the same is true but in reverse.

He asked what the procedure was for examining whether the pass should be taken away.  The Speaker John Bercow told MPs that it was up to him whether staff were able to keep their passes after such an issue had been raised. But Mr Bercow reminded MPs that ideally any complaint would be raised privately. Osamor, who was elected in May to Haringey council, apologised for the unwanted attention his case had brought. He was sentenced to a two-year community order and  days rehabilitation, last Friday.

Councillor Joseph Ejiofor, council leader, said: Councillor Osamor came to see me on Friday  October and explained about an incident that happened in September last year. I expressed my concern and disappointment by the actions that he had admitted. The Labour Party expects high standards from its elected representatives, and I know that Councillor Osamor has taken some personal time over the past four days to review whether his actions have met this expectation. Consequently, Ishmael has decided to resign from Haringey Council. We respect his decision.

A video of the vehicle outside an Aldi store in Livingston, West Lothian was posted online. It left people askingit was physically possible for the red Toyota to have made its way into the space. The clip was captured as Matthew Bestwick drove past the bizarre scene yesterday, the Daily Record reports. Matthews son, Ryan, eight, filmed while the drain engineer cruised passed the wreck which had been attended to by police around .pm.  Matthew posted the video on Facebook yesterday saying: Just when you think somethings arent possible. The clip starts by showing a police car parked by the side of the road in the Aldi car park. As Matthew drives along the video shows people standing and looking at something in front of them that is not quite in view yet. As he rolls forward it becomes clear that a red Toyota is the cause of the attention. The car has had its rear end smashed up by what appears to be a metal pole. As the video continues it reveals the car is stranded next to a zebra crossing, and is wedged in by another metal pole. The front of the car is even worse than the back as the vehicle appears to be written off. Liam Mahoney was among viewers who were amazed at the clip.  She asked: How do you even do that at Aldi though unless a crane has dropped you right in that spot  Tamara Duncan added: Oh my god I want to see how they even managed that. Joss Brown wrote: Here fair play to whoever done that. Takes some skills. Nicolle Binks added: Im really confused how they got wedged in between them. Like how is that physically possible  James Garfield said: I actually need to know exactly how this happened.. what tf did they do !. Matthew today said that he and his son Ryan were also confused as to how it happened  Matthew said: We walked by the incident at Aldi in Livingston and couldnt believe how the person had managed it. We heard in Aldi itself it was an older gentleman who was a little shaken, had done it. The only possible solution was hes reversed into the pillar that hard at an angle hes bounced into that position We got a cheeky video as we drove by. Take some skills to pull that off.

A court heard the -year-old started a relationship with Stephanie Watkis, , after meeting her in a gym in September , but weeks later he carried out the first of a string of attacks on her. In one incident in December he found a picture on her phone of a man she had been interested in two years previously. Cooksey, from Pontypool, Gwent, repeatedly punched her while she lay in bed, leaving her with a black eye and a bruised arm before forcing her to drink a bottle of rum. He then kept her as his prisoner for a week to hide her physical injuries and used her phone to tell her employers she would be off work following a car crash.  He also controlled Miss Watkis choice of clothes and make-up, and stole her phone, cutting her off from family and friends after she moved into his flat and rendering her utterly dependent on him. Today, prosecutor Roger Grfiths read a victim impact statement from Miss Watkis, who said she has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression because of the violent relationship. Miss Watkis said: He always used to say this is not a game and thats what I hear in my nightmares. Hes hugely impacted my social skill and Im now very distrustful of people. Before, I was a bubbly, friendly and welcoming person. I was carefree. This is no longer the case.  Cooksey was found guilty of two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, common assault and  imprisonment following a trial at Newport Crown Court. Harry Baker, defending, told the court at the sentencing hearing that Cooksey had no previous convictions, and both his client and Miss Watkis had admitted it was a bad relationship. Judge Thomas Crowther QC said Cooksey became obsessed with how many other men Miss Watkis had slept with before him. He said: It became very quickly clear that you had a fragile ego, a thin-skinned nature and a vile temper. I have no doubt you wanted Miss Watkis to be your partner, but not as a human, a woman, but rather as a canvas upon which you could project your fantasy image of a woman who had no history, no past, no family, no interest except you.  She didnt match your desire for some blank virginal sex robot. You attacked her, punching her as she lay on the floor curled into a ball, as she put it, like a dog. You isolated her within your home. You made her subject to your dominance.You enforced that by ruthless violence, using your physical power to subjugate her, and by demeaning behaviour. You have caused serious physical and enduring psychological harm. You drove her to the brink of tragedy. Cooksey was given a six-year extended sentence, meaning he will spend four in custody before he is released on licence. He was also given a -year restraining order in relation to Miss Watkis.

He said: You cant give flowers that big to my we! What is that all about   Meghan wears Princess Dianas butterfly earrings The Duchess beamed as she stepped out in a stunning pair of butterfly earrings once owned by her mother-in-law Diana. The duchess gave onlookers a glimpse of the beautul jewel-encrusted butterfly earrings as she pushed her hair behind her ears.  Many fans believed they may have been a pregnancy present from Prince Harry. Meghan bakes banana bread for community barbecue Everyone knows its rude to turn up to a barbecue empty handed, so Meghan decided to bake a loaf of banana bread to take to an event in Dubbo.  She made it in the kitchen at Admiralty House, the Sydney home of the Governor-General of Australia, where she stayed the night before. She also took along some Royal Blend tea from Londons Fortnum and Mason. Meghans first state dinner Weve seen Meghan dressed up on several occasions since she became a royal, but this was the first time weve seen her in full state dinner glam. She showed off her growing bump in a stunning blue dress for the event in Fiji.  Meghans powerful speech about education Meghan revealed she struggled to afford college during a powerful speech at the University of the South Pacic. She told students she paid for her tuition through scholarships, financial aid programmes and part-time jobs.  Meghan screams as she gets huge surprise from school pupilsThe couple had a chance to race the miniature racing cars during their time in Melbourne, and were given remote controllers and shown which buttons to press when the lights changed. But what staff forgot to mention is that there would be quite a bit of noise when they pressed Go. There is then a huge bang and a puff of smoke, causing a shocked Meghan to give off a little scream.  Prince Harry tries on a pair of budgie smugglers Yes really, this actually happened. They were gted to Harry when a disabled sports presenter and two members of the Australian Invictus Games team visited him at Admiralty House, the Governor General’s residence where the couple are staying in Sydney. And he put them on - over his jeans - immediately.

Despite having a bad cough he managed to make the necklace using black ribbon and painted the decorations gold. And Meghan saw little Gavins adorable sign, which read I made you a necklace and went straight over, reports news.au.

It might not have been in-keeping with royal protocol but it showed how relaxed Meghan is with her new royal responsibilities. The breach of tradition has also thrown up some new information, according to a foot expert who was keeping her eyes trained on Meghans toes. Jane Sheehan, a foot-reading expert on This Morning, revealed how Meghan has a condition called Mortons Toe, which means her big toe is shorter than her second. The condition is caused when the second metatarsal - one of the bones at the base of the toe - is longer than the first.  Sheehan, seeing the pictures, was prompted to take a look at old photos of Harrys ex-girlfriends - and made an interesting discovery. Both Cha Davy and Cressida Bonas, the princes two most famous exes, have an extra long second toe. And according to solestry experts, it has a special meaning which reveals a lot about what Harry looks for in a woman.Sheehan explained how their common feature proves Harry is attracted to natural-born leaders. The fact that Harry’s always gone for women with a longer second toe, suggests he likes women who are strong, Jane told Femail.  That doesn’t mean they are dictatorial but they lead by example. But Meghans feet apparently also show her willingness to compromise, reportedly making her a better match for Harry than Cha or Cressida. Sheehan also explained how the Duchess feet compare to her husbands - revealing Meghan is better able to delegate than Harry.  Her big toe leans towards her second toe, suggesting that she has the motivation to help him, she added. So, whilst he won’t find it easy to delegate, she will naturally want to be helpful. Meghan and Harrys feet also give away that he likes to plan ahead while she deals with whats in front of her."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle slammed unprofessional habit","story":"NewsMeghan Markle slammed for unprofessional habit no other royal women have - but theres a sweet reasonThe Duchess has been pictured doing it on a few occasions - most recently in New Zealand on the royal tourShareCommentsByNicola OakleyHead of Audience:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video meghan-markle-dips-hand-pocket-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAll eyes have been on Prince Harry and pregnant Meghan Markle over the last  days as they took on an epic royal tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have now completed their trip, which included a whopping  engagements, and can safely step out of the spotlight again having made no major slip-ups. Meghan, who is thought to be around four months pregnant, has dazzled in gorgeous dresses, sparkling jewels and sweetly cradled her growing baby bump. She and Harry have also broken royal tradition by embracing adults and kids in huge hugs on the tour. But an etiquette expert has called her out on one little habit she has, calling it unprofessional and too relaxed.  It came after Meghan and Harry visited Courtenay Creative, which runs programmes for young people to get into film, and the Duchess wore a white tuxedo dress with pockets she couldnt resist putting her hands in. William Hanson told the Daily Mail: “We know that Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are pioneering a new, relaxed, tactile branch of monarchy but having hands in the pocket is a step too far. “There is good casual and there is bad casual. Placing hands in the pocket is too relaxed and unprofessional, however dressed down Prince Harry and his we may have been.”  Meghan shouldnt be too worried, though, as Hanson believes its just a small blip - a habit she can change next time. Will the world end  he said. No. It is just a small blip in Meghan’s usually delightful manners that can be easily corrected for future engagements.” Body language expert Judi James explained Prince Charles and Prince Harry are also fans of putting their hands in their pockets, but Meghan is the only royal woman to do it too. She also revealed the reason the Duchess has adopted the unprofessional habit.  “The classic reason for this very common gesture is that it signals a subliminal desire to hide, especially when the hands are shoved deep into the pockets, Judi told OK! “It also helps get over the common problem most of us suffer from, which is not really knowing what to do with our hands when we know people are looking at us.

The group of  people had been delayed for hours and then forced to drag their cases to their hotel in storm-hit Agadir, Morocco. It all kicked off when the exhausted travellers were dropped off at the wrong place, at which point they realised the coach had left with a sleeping child on board. The seven-year-old was ed an hour later and the group, which included elderly and disabled travellers as well as families with prams, were forced to trudge through the soaked streets to their hotel. When they finally arrived at the right hotel at .am, they found most of the rooms were not available, there was nothing to eat or drink, and bedding wasnt ready in some of the rooms that were free. One traveller had an asthma attack climbing the stairs and an ambulance was called.  An angry showdown with a TUI rep occurred the following morning and footage shows the leader of the tourists demanding they are treated like human beings, prompting a massive round of applause. The group had been due to leave Morocco on October  toto Manchester Airport. But serious technical problems with the .pm flight meant they were sent back to Agadir at .am, arriving at .am. But the coach driver dropped the passengers a mile and a half from their emergency hotel accommodation and left before the mistake was realised - taking the seven-year-old boy as well. Passenger Phil Harrison, , from Adlington, Lancashire, recorded the scenes as the tourists tramped through Agadir in a rain storm looking for their accommodation. The clip starts with the sound of thunder and lightning and cuts to Phil saying: “Still walking down the same road. Still not a bleeding rep greeted by anybody. Absolutely disgusting.” The camera then pans around to show tired children dragging suitcases with some mothers carrying their children and a angry tourist shouts while dragging her suitcase: “Women with children. They’re lucky to save this.”  Phil, who emerged as the leader of the group, then goes back to narrating the clip saying “women with children pulling cases. Absolutely disgusting. TUI you are out of order.” The clip then cuts to tourists arriving at the hotel at about .am, tired, soaking and struggling to pull their luggage up the steps. The person filming the clip can be heard panting heavily. The video cuts to the following morning and Phil is filmed addressing a TUI rep, detailing their numerous complaints. To deafening applause and clapping from the dozens of weary travellers, he passionately concludes: From every colour, including race, it doesnt matter, we are all human beings here and we all deserve an explanation! The group finally ed to Manchester at pm on October , a delay admitted by TUI of  hours and  minutes. Zuzana Mestour-Tenkova, , from Manchester, said today: My seven-year old-son was left behind asleep in the coach in that big chaos, due to misunderstanding between me and my husband.  “It was a terrible experience. I still feel sick just thinking about it. We are so disappointed with the way TUI handled this whole situation. Its just disgusting.” Michele Cutts, , from Sheffield, said: “We were traumatised, frantic with worry and let down by TUI. Our families could not get any information on our flight, nothing was announced, it caused unnecessary, in some cases necessary worry on their part. And Esther Mashana said: “I thought it disgusting how we were all denied our basic human rights like water and food. “I remember in the morning I was thirsty. I asked for water at the reception and was told to go to the shops to buy water. “Absolutely appalling. I think its safe to say I wont be using TUI again. Neither will I recommend them to anyone.” A spokeswoman for TUI UK said: “We’re sorry to hear about these customers’ experience. We’ll be looking in to the matter as a priority and will follow up appropriately.” "},{"url":null,"title":"russell bishop trial witness describes","story":"NewsRussell Bishop trial: Witness describes haunting moment he found bodies of Babes in Woods victims, Kevin Rowland shouted out \"s**t, I think weve found them\" as the bodies of nine-year-olds Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway were spottedShareByTom Pettor:,  OCT NewsKaren Hadaway was found dead in bushes in Wild Park in Moulsecoomb on the outskirts of Brighton \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hospital porter has told a jury how he found the bodies of two murdered girls, dubbed the “Babes in the Woods,” in an isolated den  years ago. Kevin Rowland was just  when he joined the search for nine-year-old friends Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway after they disappeared on October , . Mr Rowland said he spotted a pink or purple jumper and the side of a young girls face who looked like she was asleep in Wild Park, half a mile from their homes on the edge of Brighton. He said: I stopped because I knew there was a young girl there and I did not want to go any further. His first words were: S**t, I think weve found them. He was giving evidence at the trial of Russell Bishop, who is accused of sexually assaulting the pair and strangling them. Mr Rowland said Bishop had joined the search and had to be restrained from approaching the dead girls.  He said: He tried to step over me but I put my arm out to stop him. Newspaper reports at the time described the girls as looking like little dolls and cuddling asasleep, the Old Bailey was told. But Mr Rowland, who was with his friend Matthew Marchant, denied going close enough to see them both properly. They were joined by Pc Paul Smith - nicknamed Smudge - two or three minutes later, he said. Mr Marchant was given a police helmet and sent off to wave it to get help, jurors heard. Pc Smith then crawled through undergrowth to reach the girls while Mr Rowland and Bishop stayed put, jurors heard. On his , Pc Smith radioed in to say he had checked each girl but found no pulse, the court heard. It was claimed on Bishops behalf that Mr Rowland and his friend had both looked at girls bodies.  Defence barrister Joel Bennathan QC also alleged that Bishop had gone up to where the bodies were and felt for a pulse. The witness repeatedly denied it, saying: Absolutely not. Mr Rowland was quizzed about an interview he gave to Brightons Evening Argus newspaper in which he described the girls as lying cuddling like they were asleep, their arms around each other. On being asked how he knew that, he said: I had no idea they were cuddling. I did not see they were cuddling. Cuddling sounded compassionate to me at the time. I may have heard that from other sources by the time I gave the interview. Mr Rowland spoke to the reporter after Nicolas father Barrie visited his home. He told jurors: Barrie was crying. He was in a real mess. I thought it would make him feel better. I think I said that to the Evening Argus because I said that to Barrie.  Giving evidence, Mr Marchant said he saw the top half of one of the girls but did not go to her. He said: Her eyes were closed asshe was asleep. The lawyer asked about a News of the World interview in which the Babes in the Wood victims were described as like little dolls, one lying on top with arm wrapped round the other. Mr Marchant denied saying that to the journalist, adding: Whatever is in that newspaper is not true. Bishop, now , originally from Brighton, has denied two charges of murder. He was cleared of the murders in  but the Court of Appeal had ordered a fresh trial in light of new DNA evidence. Some three years after his acquittal, Bishop was convicted of the kidnap, indecent assault and attempted murder of a seven-year-old girl at Devils Dyke, also on the South Downs. The trial continues.

The Duchess of Sussex stepped out to greet the public in a cute custom navy jumper and an elegant pleated skirt, completing the look with her signature messy bun. In certain lights, when Meghan was outdoors meeting the public on a walkabout, her skirt appeared to turn see-through where the pleats flatten out, revealing her underwear line and a flash of bare leg. The lower part of the dress has black and lighter blue stripes, giving an optical illusion that she is showing her legs the whole way down. Its not clear whether this is another wardrobe mal - Meghan was dubbed very relatable after leaving the tag on one of her outfits last week - or a totally intentional choice by the fashion-forward Duchess. Meghan is fast becoming a fashion icon, known for her bold statements, so its entirely possible she was aware the skirts material was quite sheer. It was also bespoke and not off the rack - and the choice of designer seems to be a meaningful one for Meghan.  The beautul pleated navy skirt was designed by Claire Waight Keller, for Givenchy, who also created Meghans stunning bridal gown and bridesmaid dresses for her wedding in May. Shes worn outfits from many dferent designers since first landing in Australia  days ago, but rounded off her first big trip with Harry with one close to her heart.

Other outfits in the Championship quickly worked out while getting the ball quickly was an option,that wasn’t on they’d have time to get the ball under control and pass their way up the pitch.As Partick Thistle, Inverness Caley Thistle and now Dunfermline have discovered, it’s been all change under the new manager.When his team lose the ball they will work hard, fast and high up the pitch to get it back as quickly as possible.That brought them their goals in Robbie’s opening game at Firhill, when for both strikes home players actually had good possession in their own half but were caught out by the speed with which they were closed down.And in the draw against ICT and in Saturday’s win over the Pars, a feature of United’s play was the number of times they won the ball back in, or near, the opponent’s defensive third.Watching from the stands, what is striking about the new policy is the amount of ground it involves the attacking players covering. At the sharp end has been Pavol Safranko. Fortunately for United, as well as being a talented goalscorer, the Slovakian prides himself on his work-rate.At the weekend he almost literally ran himself into the ground – going down with cramp in injury time and being forced off.Not far behind have been the attacking midfield trio of Paul McMullan, Fraser Aird and Billy King. As well as being expected to get forward and get on the ball, there is little respite for them when the other team’s defenders have it.Delighted as he’s been with that quartet’s attitude to a side of the game creative players do not always relish, Robbie stressed the system only works and will continue to,every outfield player buys into it.One chink in the armour though and he knows it will fall apart, allowing the other team to find men with space and time to hurt United.“Pavol’s been great. I know that he’s a very good player and, as I’ve said, I knew about him before I came here because I’d seen him play at Aalborg ,” said the gaffer.“But we also have McMullan, King, Aird, the boys behind, doing a lot of running as well.“And I’m a big believer that when we go and press, even when we’re attacking, the defence have got a big role to play in it as well.“If we’re asking forward players to go and run , ,  yards to go and press people, then the midfielders and defenders have to do it as well.“There is a responsibility on them to go and do it as well. As a team we are getting better at it, but it’s early days, we’re only three games in.”That note of caution possibly stems from the fact, although he’s been pleased with the way the players have taken to the tactic, the next couple of weeks could provide sterner tests of it.Partick and the Pars have been struggling for form and while Inverness remain the only unbeaten second tier team, as five of them in a row indicates, they have become the draw specialists of the ision.Up next are Queen of the South and leaders Ross County, two sides who might just be better equipped to cope with the high press."},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie neil mccann tried to change too much too soon at dundee","story":"When Neil McCann looks back on his time as Dundee boss he will surely learn several lessons, ones that can stand him in good steadhe s to management.Perhaps the most obvious will be that, whatever your football philosophy, it has to be tapered to suit the resources you have available when it comes to players.McCann’s mantra at Dens was to play passing football at all times and, ultimately, at all costs. That led to too many goals being lost by errors as, at high risk, the ball was played out from the back.It became increasingly clear some of his defenders in particular were not comfortable with this policy but the manager was not for budging and persevered with the style of play he was convinced would, ultimately, bring success.The number of goals it cost made it inevitable what many saw as stubbornness was what cost McCann his job.That is, perhaps, an over-simplication and, now the dust has settled on the former Scotland international’s departure, a more in-depth look throws up other factors.A look at the players he used in his eight Premiership games in charge this term highlights another couple of causes for his downfall.First off, the list of those involved looks too long. In just two-and-a-half months of league football, Dundee fielded  dferent players.Of course, injury and suspension means some of the constant stream of changes were enforced, but others suggest he was never totally sure of what his best line-up was. Given the style of play he wanted, this lack of consistency in selection had to be an issue.Arguably, an even bigger one was that he fell into the rookie manager’s trap of trying to make too many changes too quickly.The Premiership may not be one of the top leagues in Europe but it does have its own unique qualities. One of them, as most new arrivals testy, is the tempo of the play here is more frantic than in many other countries.Even players coming up from England, where the pace is higher than on the continent, usually comment on that.What that means is players from where have to be given time to adjust and, as they do, it’s important they have men around them who are already experienced campaigners in our top ision.A glance down the list of the men used this season suggests there were not enough performers who fitted into that category.Of the  he used, nine were completely new to the league, while eight others had no more than a season’s experience of it.Ironically, the most used who fell into those categories was when  started the solitary win at Hamilton last month but, in the other outings, seven or eight such players were used.That’s not saying these players are not good enough for this level but, as most experienced managers in any league will say, whatever the level of talent, having so many who are not familiar with their surroundings is a risk they wouldn’t be prepared to take.While McCann did bring in vastly-experienced Premiership performer Kenny Miller at the end of the summer transfer window, the loss through injury of Paul McGowan had to be a major blow.And it should not be seen as insignicant that, as he’s scoured the free-agent market since his arrival as manager, new boss Jim McIntyre has paid particular attention to men who know the top flight well.Martin Woods is expected to sign up once he’s proved his fitness, though Celtic on Wednesday may be too early for that. Woods’ old Ross County team-mate from when McIntyre was in charge, Paul Quinn, has also been linked."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"end-of-british-summertime-when-do-the-clocks-go-back-this-month","story":"The end of British Summertime is officially approaching, which, despite the gloom, brings one positive development ndash an extra hour in bed."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-call-it-out-campaign-hosts-public-meeting","story":"A CAMPAIGN has been launched in Glasgow to tackleanti-Irish and anti-Catholic hate crime."},{"url":null,"title":"bellahouston-park-hospice-to-be-named-in-honour-of-sir-arnold-clark","story":"A NEW state-of-the-art hospice has opened its doors in Glasgows south side for the first time today - and will be named inhonour of a famous Scot."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrity-chef-john-quigley-cooking-up-festive-treats-for-christmas-event","story":"CELEBRITY chef John Quigley is leaving his award-winning Glasgow restaurant to share festive cooking tips at a popular Christmas event."},{"url":null,"title":"world-of-preservation-as-glasgow-museum-store-opens-up-its-doors","story":"These captivating behind-the-scenes pictures show a vast collection of , taxidermy animals at a museum resource centre."},{"url":null,"title":"ryan-christie-was-too-skinny-but-now-hes-man-enough-to-be-a-celtic-player","story":"BRENDAN Rodgers feared a gust of wind would be too strong an opponent for Ryan Christie when he first saw the Highlander."},{"url":null,"title":"austin-lafferty-sisters-not-getting-a-penny-from-dads-estate-is-it-legal","story":"My Dad passed away, and among other things, my brother who dealt with the funeral and the insurance and money is saying that two of our sisters are not getting a penny of the estate.

We enjoyed Sunday but it is gone now and our total focus is on Hamilton.“We can’t take them lightly, we need to be at our bestwe want to start climbing the league.“We feel like we have not hit top gear in the league yet. The league is stronger this year.“We feel teams will be taking points off each other and it’s whoever can get that sustained run of form and sustained run of victories that will really start climbing the league.“We feel more than capable of doing that and it’s time to start showing it in the next few weeks.”Mackay-Steven does not expect an easy evening against Hamilton, who are ninth in the Premiership.He added: “It will be a tough game. They drew with Kilmarnock at the weekend and they are always tough to play against home or away.“We couldn’t celebrate Sunday too much because we’ve had to get back in and focus on Hamilton and trying to get three points.“We need to start climbing the league and hopefully we can use the winning feeling from Sunday over the next few games.”Mackay-Steven thinks Sunday’s win over Rangers can have a big impact on the Aberdeen squad.Seeing off Steven Gerrard’s side has created a feelgood factor around the Dons and Mackay-Steven hopes they can capitalise on that tonight as well as over the next couple of games, away to Kilmarnock on Sunday and at home to Hibs on Friday week.The former Celtic and Dundee United player said: “It was pleasing to go down to Glasgow and beat Rangers down there and get ourselves into a final.“The result can have a massive impact on the squad.“Hopefully it can be a springboard for our league campaign. We’ve got three games coming up in the next nine days.“They are big games coming up but hopefully we can use the confidence and the winning mentality to start picking up our league form.“It’s a big thing . we were confident before the game, but it’s important to get these results to really stamp down what you can do.“The club have been in finals over the last few years and it’s pleasing that we have managed to get into another one by beating Hibs, beating Rangers and St Mirren, all Premiership sides.“It’s been a pleasing run and hopefully we can go a step further and get our name on the trophy.”Prior to Sunday’s game Aberdeen’s ability to win pressure matches against Celtic and Rangers had been questioned.But the victory went some way to answering the critics and Mackay-Steven says the Reds always had belief in themselves. He said: “We never doubted our own ability, although there maybe wasn’t noise coming out of the changing room.“We just focused on what we can handle and what we can do.“We knew we were capable and we went down to Hampden and got the result.“It’s another final and it’s nice to be there but we will look ahead to that when it comes.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dominant dons brush aside hamilton 3 0 at pittodrie","story":"Aberdeen continued the feel-good factor of their recent BetFred Cup semi-final win over Rangers by overcoming Hamilton -

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key. In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

Stagecoach insist they have to keep developing the Ayrshire network and fish where the passengers are. And they say: “These changes better reflect our customers travel habits. “A number of these changes will deliver improvements in reliability and frequency, while others will offer a service proportionate to demand.” The switches in service are planned to begin operating in January. The changes were discussed by the Ayrshire Bus Users Group in Troon on Saturday. Watchers are particularly interested in the failed route which served the Silverburn mall in Pollok at weekends. It was launched exactly two years ago with the now departed managing director Tom Bridge crowing: “Shopping habits are changing from traditional high streets.” Ayrshire traders, however, deemed it a slap in the face. But of the X from Ayr, Prestwick and Kilmarnock to Silverburn, they now admit: “Our plan is to remove this service due to very low passenger numbers.”  Stagecoach’s Ayr HQ is wanting passenger feedback on the plans and staged an information day at Ayr Town Hall on Monday. Travellers are now likely to get back their direct Ayr to Irvine number  route via Troon. The last change the company made was to introduce a A which will be scrapped. But this will only be every  minutes. The new  route will take in Barassie, Monkton and Loans. That means Loans will no longer get the  coaster which had erted through the Main Street off the A. Belmont would no longer get the number six which was every  minutes. Instead it will get the number seven every  minutes - andpassenger numbers dont improve it may also be culled. The number two will pull out of Dalmilling and Hayhill, with the areas served by the number one and three. Stagecoach want to sht the X to Hamilton from Ayr away from Prestwick and take it up Whitletts Road.

Ian McCalls men, who saw two penalty appeals turned down, eventually gained their reward when Rose climbed to bullet home a Declan McDaid corner. It was no more than United deserved for another battling display on the road and keeps them firmly in touch with leaders Ross County at the summit. Heres three things we learned on another big afternoon for the Honest Men: Rose rises to the occasion Hes been immense for Ayr at the back this season but Michael Rose was the hero at the other end today and he climbed to power home Uniteds deserved winner. The former Aberdeen man has formed an impressive defensive partnership with Jamie Adams - and once again the pair were fantastic at Firhill. But Rose proved his threat in the opposition box when rising to bullet home Declan McDaids corner, coming as it did at the end of concerted Ayr pressure. Rose looks to have a bright future in the game and he deservedly gains the headlines today.  Whistler Bobby sends Ayr raving Madden - AGAIN It would be fair to say Ayr boss Ian McCall and ref Bobby Madden arent the greatest of pals. McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

Kenny added: “Nothing is set in stone at this stage. “In essence the only thing changing is larger toilets – there is no increase to the size of the building. “Everything  would be a redesign of the current layout. “A possible name change is among the ideas we are also considering.” The move comes as Buzzworks continues its rapid expansion across Scotland.

first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane october 26 2018","story":"In the Courier, of November  ,  years on from Armistice Day, the Remembrance services were reported with six paragraphs on the front page and no pictures.Perhaps this was because the world seemed a more dangerous place.The Vietnam War was at roughly its mid-point and was to continue for another seven years.Horric pictures, shot war photographers such as Don McCuillin and Tim Page, filled #s daily papers and television news.In the UK The Troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland after a civil rights march, on October , led to widespread rioting.That  report states: #Highland Parish Church was the venue for the main service with contingents of ious armed forces and youth organisations parading there.#Unfortunately, the annual service at the War Memorial on the Esplanade had to be cancelled because of inclement weather and the service was held indoor at Victoria Hall.#Representatives of the RAF, the Royal Navy, the TA, Sea Cadets, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and Army Cadets marched to the Highland Parish Church where Reverend C.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

their way to the four corners of the globe.And for campaigners currently arguing against the increasing redevelopment of the area, they will bring a pang of regret for a once buoyant industrial age and tight-knit community that has gradually disappeared.Hundreds of fascinating images of a lost way of le in the capitalrsquos increasingly gentried and redeveloped quarter of Leith were discovered in Edinburghrsquos Central and Leith libraries, tucked inside more than a dozen painstakingly compiled volumes spanning decades.They had been gathered by local historian, Dr James Scott Marshall, who displayed remarkable foresight by saving dozens of photographs, postcards and newspaper cuttings depicting daily le in what was once Edinburghrsquos gateway to the globe.The forgotten images include grainy black and white photographs showing clusters of steamers and sailing ships at berth on The Shore - today a tourist hotspot and home to Michelin star restaurants, shops and galleries.Many capture the people of the port going about their business, either working in the once thriving shipyards, enjoying a game of golf on Leith Links, proudly showing off their Clydesdale horses or outside their shops.Some will remind Leithers of what once was ndash and what is on the way: images include workers laying tram tracks to link the port with the city centre.Others provide a captivating glimpse of long-lost buildings and once packed sugar and whisky bond warehouses which once defined the historic port and are now either upmarket homes or offices.The eclectic assortment of images and ephemera provides a snapshot of social history thatrsquos a world away from the portrsquos modern hipster image, with its trendy cafes, Michelin star restaurants and tourist attractions.The collection

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Thursday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amThis week#s edition of The Orcadian is now available in shops and online, here.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach. It’s a particularly impressive atmosphere when the tide is high and the weather rough.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am.

The amount of money taken from our taxi drivers is obscene.“We’re powerless to it. We are prisoners because the public has a choice, we have no choice. If we refuse a customer who calls up then we will lose business. “This price rise is going to cost our drivers hundreds of thousands of pounds every year. It’s got to the point where enough is enough.”Airport chiefs estimate the new charges will make £ million each year. They also expect it will reduce the number of cars using the access road by , with hopes it will encourage passengers to use public transport.But Edinburgh Western MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said the changes would directly affect many of his constituents who do not have direct public transport links to the airport.He said: “This increase will impact on my constituents in western Edinburgh because they are likely to be collecting friends and family from the airport. “I agree with the airport in encouraging people to use public transport, however that presupposes adequate public transport links to the airport.“This news will come as a surprise to many and is bad news for my constituents living in Cramond and South Queensferry, for example, who have no direct link to the airport. I would like the airport to use the revenue to subsidise extra transport links.”Edinburgh Airport contentiously began charging for every car and taxi to drop passengers off outside the terminal in . The changes bring Edinburgh almost in line with charges faced by drivers at Glasgow Airport – £ for up to ten minutes, £ for  minutes and £ for  minutes.The revenue will go towards the £ million project to build a second access route to the airport, possibly from Gogar. Plans are set to be discussed at December’s city council housing and economy committee.Edinburgh Airport Chief Executive, Gordon Dewar, said: “We’re committed to giving passengers the very best travel experience and this includes their access to and from the airport.“Our proposals for a new access road, which we anticipate funding the majority of, will go a long way towards easing the current congestion problems passengers face, and the consequent environmental impact. I appreciate the increase will not be welcome news for all but I’m sure most will realise the need for action to combat the congestion we currently experience.“We are committed to working with the council and other partners to ensure that existing and new infrastructure is fit for purpose and will continue to make informed decisions to alleviate congestion now and in the coming months leading up to the peak summer period.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4822094.1540934176!/image/image.jpg","title":"staff refuse to teach violent pupils at edinburgh special school","story":"Teachers at an Edinburgh special school have been sent home with no pay after refusing to look after pupils who they claim have subjected them to a litany of assault and abuse.In what is believed to be a first in Scotland, a union has accused the city council of “bullying and intimidating” staff as  teachers at Kaimes School in Liberton are refusing to provide lessons to eight pupils over physical and verbal assaults.Violent attacks by students are understood to have included chairs and signs being thrown at teachers, causing injuries with police called in.The situation is so serious that Education secretary John Swinney is due to meet union leaders today.A school source has spoken to the Evening News about the “chaos” that erupted last week over the pupils’ behaviour, which the union say has left them no choice but to down tools.The teachers in question are members of the NASUWT union, which earlier this year balloted for industrial action short of a strike by refusing to teach or supervise eight pupils who they believe pose a risk to health, safety and welfare. The move is believed to be a first in Scotland.“They refused to teach them because they’d been assaulted so many times”, said a school source. “There’s just no control.”The eight students are understood to have spent last week in a class together with seven pupil support assistants.“The headteacher told the teachers on Monday morning they weren’t allowed in the school. This is the first time this has ever happened in Scotland. A teacher has refused to teach one kid before but never eight,” added the school source.But an Edinburgh City Council source said the issue was a red line that was “discriminating against disabled children”. They added: “You cannot pick and choose which disabled children you provide a service for”.Union bosses are set to meet with education secretary John Swinney tomorrow about the situation, after negotiations with the council broke down.Chris Keates, NASUWT general secretary, labelled the council’s action as “one of the most disturbing cases I have ever experienced of an employer failing in its duty of care”.She said: “The teachers, and indeed other pupils at the school have, month after month, faced violent physical assaults, a constant stream of verbal abuse and threats and malicious allegations. Equipment has been smashed and classrooms trashed.“Rather than supporting the teachers to deal with these pupils, Edinburgh City Council instead has embarked on a campaign of aggressive and punitive actions towards the teachers, simply because they have dared to stand up for what is right.”Staff experienced with working with children with special needs have been brought in to cover the absentees. The council is appealing for the union to come back to the negotiation table and has written to parents to update them on the situation.A council spokesman said: “As a local authority, we have a duty to provide education to all children in Edinburgh. We are also committed to ensuring our teachers and other staff are fully supported to deliver the excellent level of education children and young people have a right to expect.“We continually review how we can support our teachers in what at times can be challenging places to work. An improvement action plan for Kaimes School has been developed in consultation with staff and subject to external expert scrutiny. This is in the very early stages of being implemented and would urge everyone to work with us as we take this plan forward. “The council has been trying to engage with NASUWT at all levels to discuss any concerns they have and we are disappointed that they have failed to respond positively to date and decided on this course of action. We cannot have a situation where staff decide who they are and who they are not willing to teach as this would be contrary to their terms of employment.“We remain committed to working with staff to ensure we improve attainment and wellbeing while also delivering a positive working environment for both teachers and pupils. This is part of the council’s commitment to put inclusion at the heart of everything we do and we want the staff involved and the NASUWT to sit down with us as soon as possible to resolve this situation.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4822661.1541013356!/image/image.jpg","title":"the hard evidence that it s great being scottish leader comment","story":"New report finds Scotland#s largest three cities outperform rest of UK on four out of ten economic and social factors.Given the interminable debates over Brexit and independence, a decade of austerity and the rise of far-right forces across the world, modern le can sometimes feel a bit depressing.So, occasionally, it’s a good idea to remind ourselves that the country we live in is wealthy, peaceful and democratic.According to the World Bank, the UK has the th highest GDP per capita in the world – just ahead of Japan and France, but well behind Ireland, in th, and the US, in th.

Glasgow was in mid-table at th after a rise of two places.: Scottish football is a bilion-pound beautul game – leader commentThis doesn’t mean we should forget or gloss over Scotland’s problems, like the fact that almost half the children in central Glasgow are growing up in poverty or that a higher percentage of Scottish pensioners live in poverty than the UK average. In fact, the opposite is true, it should act as a call to arms to ensure that more people share in Scotland’s relative good fortune. Democratic politicians on the left and right will argue about how this should be done, but the aim is still the same. The SNP argues Scotland would do betterit was an independent nation Unionists insist the reverse is true.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Thursday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

My parents told me I was just going to speak to someone about my fear of dogs but I didnt fully understand the enormity of it.Nicola continued: The psychiatrist would give me tasks to carry out each week but none of it worked and as I got older my fear just got worse.One day I went to Crawfordsburn with my fianceacute and a dog came right up beside me and I totally freaked out.After years of torment Nicola decided to get in contact with Alan Gichrist who holds hypnotherapy sessions in the Adair Arms every Thursday evening.In my head I didnt think it would work. If I am honest I didnt think anything would ever work but I went along to the session anyway.After only three sessions Nicola said she was able to walk past a dog in the street which wasnt on a lead.I didnt even think about it. It didnt bother me at all, Nicola explained.I have lived with this phobia all my le and hypnotherapy has totally changed my le.People who know me knew the extent of my fear and they are shocked at the outcome.Another woman who has benefited from hypnotherapy is Karen McCullough.Karens fear of cats started  years ago when one came in through her window.I couldnt get the cat back out of the house and from that moment I was petried of them, Karen explained.It stopped me going places with my children because they were everywhere.The decision to do something about her fear came this Summer after a holiday in Mexico.My holidays were ruined because the cats were all around the hotel. If we were having dinner I would have to get up and leavea cat came anywhere near us.Karen continued: I needed to do something about it because it was disrupting all aspects of my le.In my job as a hairdresser I have to go bride’s homes for weddings and it was so bad that I couldnt go inthey had a cat.Karen got in contact with Alan and after four sessions her phobia had gone.So much so that on a recent holiday in Turkey she was even able to lt the cats which were around her hotel.It has changed my le completely and I am so grateful to Alan for helping me overcome this phobia.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”Eddie lts gym trophy\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight.

It is rare to see so much detail and well written legible letters which gives us a fantastic insight into the Dixon family and Patrick’s le at the front.“Within these letters we see Patrick discuss Irish political developments such as the  conscription crisis, the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in Ireland and the torpedoing of the RMS Leinsteroff the Irish coast.He also describes his excitement at the signing of the Armistice, in a letter dated th November , and the long wait for demobilisation.Highlights from the collection include a soldiers’pantomime programme for January , emergency issue Francs, a German Disabled War Veteran Fund ticket picked up at the front, and never before published photographs of the front, taken by Patrick himself. Speaking about the origin of the material, Paula added: “We believe Patrick’s sister, Margaret, who became a GP in the Dunmurry area, married a Mr Wynne, who was involved with the Belfast Charitable Society and thus the material deposited in the Society#s attic for safekeeping. This is all very timely as Clton House is hosting an autumn series of historical lectures, including a symposium on th November  to mark the ending of the Great War. Philip Orr, the playwright and historian, and Dr Éamon Phoenix, the historian and broadcaster, will deal with the Irish contribution to the war and its impact on this island. This event will now include an exhibition of the Dixon War Letters, unveiled to the public for the first time.

As he was going off, McDonnell reacted to taunts and a plastic water bottle was thrown towards him.This led to punches thrown with several Newington players following him off the pitch as scuffles ensued. Things appeared to have calmed down with the players ing to the field, but the incident then sparked off again as McDonnell was being led to the dressing rooms. Again, players left the pitch, some it seemed were trying to calm the situation rather than join in, but the referee had seen enough, saying afterwards the chaotic scenes were out of control and he had no choice but to abandon the game.What happens now is up to the Co. Antrim FA. The draw for the semi-finals were made on Saturday with East Belfast awaiting the winner of Saturday’s gamethat is to be replayed or not.The Co. Antrim secretary was unavailable for comment this morning, but a decision is expected in the coming days.Click here to watch short Facebook video of the St James Swts v Newington game at https:www.facebook AndytownNews videos  "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tiocfaidh a la carte","story":"LONG Quiche, Come Out You Rack Of Lambs, The Frying Column and Turkey Ár Lá – these were just some of the frontrunners for the name of the new cookbook by former Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams, who finally settled on The Negotiators Cookbook – Best Kept Secret of the Peace Process.The Negotiators Cookbook is the latest offering from Adams and it gives an insight into a part of the peace process that up until now has had little light shone upon it.The book details the efforts of two of the insiders, Ted Howell and Pádraic Wilson, to sustain the stamina and energy of the Sinn Féin negotiating team during years of high level negotiations with the British government and includes many of their recipes.Speaking at the launch in An Chultúrlann on Monday, Mr Adams said: “I’m here to tell you about one of the best kept secrets of the Irish peace process. When you bring together a group of hungry republicans they have to be fed, so who fed them  We fed ourselves.”Describing the motivation behind the book, which is to be taken with a pinch of salt, Mr Adams said: “Although this is a serious cookbook it is also a bit of craic, all the recipes are well worn, tried and tested.“In the course of the talks process and particularly when we ed to Stormont, the Sinn Féin team fed ourselves.“The first time I met with the British Government was in London in , myself and Martin McGuinness and others, we spent a lot of time sitting about strategizing, debating and discussing, the British were historically reluctant to feed any of the delegations.“Sometimes when talks in Downing Street went on into the evening we persuaded Tony Blair to send out for pizzas or Chinese food. When we came back home Ted started bringing up bits and pieces of grub and that developed until we had our own diners club in room  .“Pádraic then started bringing desserts, what I have done is to put those recipes together here.“This is a fundraiser, the money goes to Sinn Féin, it’s out in time for Christmas, and I hope that you enjoy it, I certainly enjoyed putting it together.”Gerry Adams then proceeded to hand out slices of pudding – drenched in alcohol – which he himself prepared earlier.He added: “The book is dedicated to our negotiating team and particularly to Siobhán O’Hanlon who was a very central part of the team.”The Negotiators Cookbook is available from sinnfeinbookshop and all good book shops, priced at £.."},{"url":null,"title":"1000 yearold bell with link to st patrick goes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

Delamont already has stunning picturesque walks, a childrenrsquos adventure playground, miniature railway and cafe, but more investment is needed to enhance what it has to offer.Cllr Walker said creating new attractions will increase the parkrsquos profile and attract even more visitors.He added: ldquoI have always argued Delamont offers massive tourist potential and that with some imaginative thinking and new investment, it can rival any country park in Ireland.

As I was always in the public eye, it was dreadful, said Naomi.ldquoIrsquove lost about half of the weight that I put on and have still about two and a half stone to lose yet.ldquoBecause of the stroke, I also wasnrsquot able to walk when I got home and I wasnrsquot talking right.

She loved her cake and all the party food.ldquoIt was great to be able to share some of the positive aspects of Meganrsquos le with our family, friends and supporters as there has been so much dficulty along the way.It was very much a family affair attended by Meganrsquos siblings, Hannah, Lily and Stuart, great grandmother Mrs Rosaleen Traynor and her aunt Kelly, who provides a lot of her care.Megan will never have the le that she should have had because of her condition.In many ways, even though the Traynors went on to have three other children who donrsquot have the condition, they were robbed of their hopes and dreams for their first-born.But Megan and her parents felt that it was only right that they should include people at the party who have helped them along their journey so far.In  more than pound, was raised to help Megan become one of the first children from the UK to have pioneering stem cell treatment in China.Unlike some other children who benefited from the controversial treatment, it did not cure or help Meganrsquos blindness.But the Traynors believe that it did help Megan in her mental development at the time, although that has now halted.When her epilepsy and major seizures began to impact on her already compromised quality of le, the local community again rallied around in  to help the Traynors create a safe back garden with sensory equipment, complete with a small hydrotherapy pool to help calm her.Leanne knows that they have been blessed with a lot of help, support and generosity from the local community.ldquoAll I know is that there are a lot of very good people in the Downpatrick area who really pull together when people need help, said Leanne.ldquoThey are people who have helped us and raised money, or who helped get us equipment or whatever, every time we needed it.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sir Reg Empey, former Ulster Unionist leader Yesterday Sammy Wilson told the News Letter the DUP now intends to back the Budget in the House of Commons tomorrow, adding that it would be “foolish and reckless” to do otherwise.But he stressed that a roughly £ billion boost in the Budget will not prevent the DUP pulling the plug on its deal to prop up the minority Tory government in the futurethe prime minister breaches the party’s red lines on Brexit.The East Antrim MP said: “If anyone thinks a few extra pounds is going to soften our attitude towards any Brexit deal which treats NI dferently they are very mistaken ... the future of Northern Ireland within the UK is more important than a few bob in your pocket.”Ex-UUP leader Lord Empey said the DUP is “retreating with their tail between their legs”.Its warning that it might not back the Budget was “always an empty threat”, he said, adding: “You can only rattle your sabre so many times until someone calls your bluff.”: DUP will support Budget but vows: ‘We will not be bought’Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8689506.1541057463!/image/image.jpg","title":"health","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Health   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Health Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Health      Medicinal cannabis now available on prescription to NI patientsCannabis-based medicinal products will be available in Northern Ireland from today.

Interactives provide a useful addition to such an environment.” He added: “In this age of technology, it is also productive to include other ways of encouraging education through participation, and this is why we developed our table top board game.”As a worldwide organisation, it is estimated as many as , Orangemen and women enlisted in the armed forces or the ious medical and nursing units.The wider museum exhibition, which was launched earlier this year, marks not only the centenary of the Armistice, but also chronicles the remarkable personal stories of iniduals associated with the loyal institutions who enlisted for King and country.A number of signicant items relating specically to Orangemen who served with the th Ulster Division and other regiments from the period feature in the exhibition, as well as a number of battlefield incidentals and other artefacts.Among the exhibits is a replica of a Royal Naval Armoured Car – ‘The Ulster’ – which was deployed on the Western Front in .

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The previous lowest price for checked luggage was pound for up to kg, which remains an option for those with heavier cases.The maximum size of ldquopersonal bags allowed on board has been increased by %.Passengers who pay for priority boarding ndash which costs pound ndash will continue to be allowed to take both a ldquopersonal bag and small suitcase as hand baggage.Ryanair believes some customers may prefer the pound checked luggage option because they do not want to drag a wheelie case through airport security.It claimed most passengers will be unaffected by the changes, as % already buy priority boarding and a further % travel with only a ldquopersonal bag.A statement on the airlinersquos website read: ldquoMain benefits of this new policy will be reduced flight delays and cheaper checked bag option. Pack more liquids into a kg checked wheelie bag.

Birches Primary School Eco Team A new Eco Team launched the special video entitled ‘Our Footpath Dilemma’ which highlighted the dangers pupils face.In a delightful storytelling format, the pupils have been photographed at ious parts of the road leading up to the school.Clever graphics and simple story telling gets across the dficulties faced by pupils, young and very young as well as their parents and staff.It portrays how the footpath starts to disappear not far from the school building. And their simple demand is to have a proper footpath to make it safe for everyone to walk to school.A private development had recently built a short footpath along part of the route. This made it safer for part of the route.Unfortunately it wasn’t long until the new footpath stopped. This was the unsafe route left for the children.The pupils had to walk in single file on the road and had to be supervised by an adult.Now the Eco Team are spearheading a campaign. They asked: “Can the government turn their frowns upside down and give them the footpath they so desperately need ”Backing their campaign is Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty who spent the morning with her Ulster Unionist colleague MLA Doug Beattie at the school to hear their desperate plea for a foopath.She said: “I feel very proud of the pupils who have a strong community spirit and great campaigners!“They have shown a great deal of determination and perseverance.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast. Industry STR Global figures for June revealed that occupancy rates in Belfast were down by around % after , new rooms were added.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Primark-2.jpg","title":"primark to reopen and city cordon reduced","story":"Posted on Friday  October  by John Mulgrew The green light has been given to begin work on the Bank Buildings in Belfast which were gutted in a fire – leading to a huge cordon hitting city centre retail. Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %. We also welcome the news that Primark will open again soon as it will serve as a footfall draw to this part of the city which has been devastated.
