But ministers are said to be interested in refocusing aid in line with the UK\u0027s diplomatic and economic priorities.         The Department for International Development insists it has \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 to corruption and adopts extensive measures to prevent taxpayers\u0027 money falling into the wrong handsRespected think-tank Transparency International produces an annual list of corrupt countries. Analysis by the Daily Mail shows that Britain sends aid money to 17 of the worst 20.Beneficiaries include Somalia and Syria, where Western aid has been appropriated by terrorist groups. In 2017, the Government was forced to suspend a £12million aid scheme to Syria amid revelations that the cash was at risk of going to jihadi groups.Aid money sent to Somalia is also at risk of being \u0027taxed\u0027 by terror groups such as Al Shabab. An investigation by CNN in 2017 found the murderous group was extorting thousands of pounds a day through roadblocks and \u0027taxes\u0027 on merchants supplying international aid destined for refugees.An internal Dfid \u0027risk register\u0027 in 2017 concluded there was a \u0027certain\u0027 chance of funds being erted by extremist groups.

Iraq saw its funding almost double to £73.9million.The overall total was swollen by big increases in aid to Syria and Yemen, where civil wars have led to humanitarian crises. Both countries have also seen reports of aid shipments being stolen.A Dfid spokesman said taxpayers\u0027 money was safe. \u0027UK aid only goes to trusted partners to help those in extreme poverty, not directly to the governments of the most corrupt countries,\u0027 the spokesman said. \u0027Dfid has strict measures in place to protect taxpayers\u0027 money including regular audits and fraud

mary bennet to thomas cromwell how novelists make us love unlikeable characters","story":"How can Mary, the charmless Bennet sister in Pride and Prejudice, become a heroine? Author Janice Hadlow on the novelist as makeover artistPoor Mary Bennet. It’s hard not to feel her creator didn’t like her very much. Jane Austen described Pride and Prejudice as “light, bright and sparkling” but she didn’t bestow any of these qualities on the unfortunate middle Bennet daughter. Unlike her sisters, Mary possesses neither looks, wit or charm. Her hard won “accomplishments” have only made her pompous and priggish. In a book in which even the characters we aren’t supposed to admire fizz and pop with energy – step forward Lydia Bennet – only Mary fails to shine.So why choose her as the subject for a novel? On one level, I simply felt sorry for her. I’d been a bookish young woman myself, with all the usual misgivings about how I appeared to the world. I would have loved to be her elder sister Elizabeth – handsome, assured and funny. But in truth, I suspected there was more than a little of Mary about me.But the same sympathy that drew me towards Mary made me reluctant to accept in its entirety Austen’s version of her. The qualities that condemn her in Pride and Prejudice did not seem so heinous to me. I thought her efforts to educate herself, in the face of her family’s indifference, commendable rather than ridiculous. And the earnestness that resulted from her lonely endeavours seemed rather sad and touching. The Mary I wanted to write about would look rather different from Austen’s character. But could readers ever be convinced to accept her? Once a character is established as fundamentally unlikable, can anything be done to make us change our minds?I’ve always believed that everything appears different if you can persuade readers to look at the world through that character’s eyes. Even the most unlikely figures can be redeemed. I’d seen this happen in one of the very first books I bought for myself, Rosemary Hawley Jarman’s We Speak No Treason. I was swept away by Jarman’s impassioned attempt to rescue Richard III from his dark status as one of the greatest villains in British history. I was thrilled by the idea that everything we thought we knew about Richard was wrong, that his character looked very different when viewed from the perspective of those who really knew him.I developed a taste for similarly provocative fictional re-evaluations, and devoured Robert Graves’s I, Claudius, relishing the way in which the despised narrator is gradually revealed to be one of the cleverest and most cunning of the imperial Roman family. I returned again and again to Gore Vidal’s bracingly astringent Burr, which told the story of one of the most reviled figures of the American revolution. As the man who shot Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr is now probably as famous as he’s ever been, thanks to the musical Hamilton. However, he’s still seen as the bad guy – or baddish, at least.This wouldn’t have worried Vidal very much, for unlike Jarman, it was never his intention to present the subject of his book as a hero. Jarman’s whole purpose was to clear Richard’s name, to present him as a victim of history. But for both Graves and Vidal, it was the moral ambiguity of their subjects that made them interesting. Their aim was not to whitewash them into goodness, but to enter into their hearts and minds and invite us to see the world from their bleakly pragmatic perspective. First we’re intrigued then we’re immersed and soon we find ourselves identifying with a character we’d previously thought irredeemable.For me, the greatest triumph of this genre is unquestionably Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall. After reading her seductive and nuanced picture of Thomas Cromwell it is impossible ever to think of him again just as Henry VIII’s cold, calculating enforcer, the man with the unsettling stare who gazes out of Holbein’s famous portrait. Mantel achieves this not by denying Cromwell’s dark side – he remains, in her telling, a man with a profoundly elastic moral compass – but by giving him a credible and complex inner life that, when fully appreciated, allows us to understand, if not always to condone, his actions. There is, she seems to suggest, no single Cromwell for us to pin down. Like all of us, he has a variety of guises in which he presents himself to the world. Some are ruthless, some more benign. What you think of him will very much depend on which of those faces you encounter.It’s noticeable that all the central characters in these revisionist retellings are based on real people – and that all of them are men. This shouldn’t really surprise us. One of the purposes of these books is to make us think again about power and those who wield it. But there’s another form of fictional reimagining that has sought to sidestep these limitations by turning away from the heart of the action. It looks instead towards characters relegated to the margins and invites them into the spotlight.Many of these new protagonists are drawn not from history but from familiar works of fiction – and many of them are women. A key example, and still one of the best, is Jean Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea. In Jane Eyre, the first Mrs Rochester, insane and hidden from view, cannot bear witness to her experiences all we hear from her are cries and screams. But Rhys lets her speak – and having heard her story, it is impossible to think of her any longer as merely the malign impediment to Jane’s happy ending. We know now who Bertha Rochester is, and our feelings about her have shifted profoundly as a result.Pat Barker’s The Silence of the Girls focuses on a different kind of voicelessness. Her book is loosely based on Homer’s Iliad, but is very much not a narrative of classical heroes. Instead it introduces us to the women who trudge along silently at the edge of the original, the mothers, wives and daughters who are the collateral damage of a war between men. Barker lifts them out of their anonymity, and in doing so transforms how we think of them.Alice Randall’s The Wind Done Gone explores the experience of a very different kind of dispossession. Taking its inspiration from Gone With the Wind, it turns away from the white-pillared plantation house and tells its story not from the perspective of the slave owners, but from the point of view of the enslaved. Randall’s characters don’t exist voicelessly in the background but stand full square before us. This turns an entire fictional landscape upside down, reshaping our sympathies in the process.But if shifting perspective can make us feel more benign towards one character, it also alters how we see those around them. In Wolf Hall, the saintly Thomas More takes on a far darker quality. George Washington is a lumpish untrustworthy manipulator in Burr. In writing my own book, I too found established characters taking on a new identity. In Pride and Prejudice, Mary Bennet’s mother is selfish, tactless and annoying – but her power over its heroine is limited. Elizabeth is too confident to be seriously affected by her mother’s complaints. For Mary, however, who possesses none of the qualities her mother admires, Mrs Bennet is potentially a far more baleful presence, with the capacity to do real emotional damage. As we begin to identify more with Mary, we become less indulgent towards her mother.Likability, in literature as in life, is a fluid and unpredictable quality. Even the greatest author can’t always control how a character is received. Fanny Price, the upright heroine of Mansfield Park, was one of Austen’s favourite characters but although Fanny has her defenders, she’s never appealed to readers as much as she did to her creator. Fanny’s stern rectitude is worthy and deserving – but it doesn’t make her particularly sympathetic. In contrast, it’s impossible to dislike Mary Crawford, the novel’s bad girl. Yes, she’s self-absorbed and worldly, insufficiently respectful to the clergy, and takes far too light a view of adultery. But she’s also an irrepressible Austen character in her best “light, bright and sparkling” style. No matter that Mary has no principles, she wins our hearts nonetheless.• The Other Bennet Sister by Janice Hadlow is published by Mantle. To order a copy go to bookshop.

That’s why I’m standing• Lisa Nandy is Labour MP for WiganWe are out of power and on the rocks. The shattering collapse in trust among lifelong Labour voters has been a long time coming. Now is not the time to steady the ship or try not to oversteer. Unless we change course, we will become irrelevant.This change starts with empowering people to make change themselves. We’ve been a decade out of power in Westminster, changing our leaders, and commissioning reports and focus groups from offices in central London just to hear what is happening in the country. If we were trying to reinforce the sense that we just don’t get it, we couldn’t do better than this.We’ve been running scared of debate, dissent and constructive challenge. The anger and infighting has to end. We are leaving the EU on the hardest of terms. Laws that defend people’s health and their safety at work, the environment and the minimum wage are unlikely to survive a free trade deal with Donald Trump. A century of progress is at stake. In this fight, Green MP Caroline Lucas is not our enemy. We are an internationalist party, and we should make common cause with others here and around the world. We need to stop waiting for a saviour and have the confidence to believe that change comes from ourselves. Ours is a movement that will graft and toil to deliver change together.To do it, we have to become rooted in our communities again. The GMB union’s campaigns on Amazon and Uber, Unison’s resistance to the privatisation of NHS staffing or Unite’s community campaign on universal credit could create the same groundswell for change that brought us the minimum wage – a beacon of hope in similarly dark times. Labour activists support credit unions and law projects in every nation and region of the UK. They need and deserve real power, resources and respect to allow us, by the strength of our common endeavour, to achieve more than we achieve alone.In the decade I spent fighting for the rights of marginalised children before I became an MP, I learned that winning a vote in parliament is never enough. What is needed is the hard yards of winning the argument, inch by inch, in town halls, workplaces and pubs. This is where we fight to regain people’s trust and win permission to deliver radical change.The luxuries of a hung parliament are behind us. If we want a hearing we will have to go out into the country, create waves, and make it happen. The next Labour leader will have to be up for a scrap – willing to run to the places where we are loathed, take the anger on the chin, and make and win the argument.The belief that this country can be better drives me forward. Bring back universal child benefit, end the benefit cap and build a system that gives people dignity, not just an allowance with conditions set by decision-makers in Whitehall. Reclaim our public services so they are run by empowered frontline professionals, not distant experts. Bring investment to places that have lacked so much for so long to deliver good jobs, not charity. Find the courage to tackle the social care crisis – no longer can we abandon people to die in poverty after a lifetime of work.We could run the economy as if the future matters. More than 1,000 fossil-fuelled power stations are being built across the world, many with the support of UK banks. Their backing equals the whole coal-power capacity of the EU and Australia put together. This will raise flood risks in Britain, threatening everything from our pensions to our planet. It is just one symbol of an economy that puts profit before people – with appalling long-term consequences.By the next election we will be trying to win voters who were toddlers when there was last a Labour government. More than stories about how Margaret Thatcher ruined the NHS, they will need evidence of the real change that comes from our grassroots. Born in 1979, I was 17 before I saw a Labour government, and at times it felt that change would never come. I went into politics to change the world, and that flame has never dimmed. Our biggest asset is the people in every community and workplace I have ever been – MPs, councillors, activists, trade unionists and charities who give their all because they see a spark that, if ignited, might just change the world.Amid the shellshock, anger, hurt and frustration, there is hope. This defeat was shattering, and I never want us to be here again. But rebuilding cannot wait. I am standing to be the leader of the Labour party to defeat Boris Johnson and lead a compassionate, radical, dynamic government that I firmly believe most people want and deserve. That leadership will place at its heart an end to the wholesale patronising of working people as a homogeneous group, to be saved or condemned.

Now it has designs on the UKModern Toss on The Masked SingerFrom the personal boundary-decimating blancmange that was Mr Blobby to a satin-clad Ann Widdecombe being dragged across the dancefloor to the strains of Wild Thing, Saturday night TV has long been built on inanity, ridiculousness and highly disconcerting fever dream sequences. But this month the schedules are destined to become that little bit more hallucinatory thanks to The Masked Singer, a show that makes that time Dale Winton forced celebrities to hurl themselves through holes in a giant foam wall seem like an entirely rational and restrained way to entertain a nation.A fur-coated Frankenstein’s monster of a format, The Masked Singer takes a cast of celebrities and conceals their identity behind elaborate and frequently terrifying animal costumes. These disguised celebs then have to sing before a panel of (also) celebrity detectives, who are tasked with ining the star behind the disguise. In each episode, via a complex judging process, one contestant is unmasked to squeals of frenzied excitement. Essentially, Saturday night TV is about to be filled with the sight of a giant rubber duck performing Like a Virgin in a conical bra, as Jonathan Ross, Davina McCall, Rita Ora and The Hangover star Ken Jeong make wild, baseless guesses about the bird’s true identity. And if versions of the show that have already aired in Thailand, Mexico, France or the US – where it was the highest-rated show on network TV last year – are anything to go by, it is likely to be a smash.The UK is actually relatively late to the nightmare-inducing shindig that is The Masked Singer. In a pleasing inversion of the traditional west-to-east TV-globalisation narrative, the show started life as a South Korean format now 22 countries have their own versions. Why has this patently bonkers concept taken off in such a big way?For Jeong, who is also a panellist on the US version, The Masked Singer’s appeal lies in its detachment from reality. “It’s pure escapism,” he says. “In a world where the political landscape is very intense globally, it’s a palate cleanser. There is nothing partisan or political about this show.” By the same token, you could view its WTF-ery as a reflection of surreal times: gobsmacking political developments and outrageous opinions now form society’s bassline hum – perhaps we need something even stranger to cut through the noise.The long-term sustainability of all this internet chatter is dependent on one factor: genuinely good celebs. Unlike the obscurities that bulk up the Strictly and I’m a Celebrity lineups, each star has to be recognisable in order to secure that big reveal high – the US version has attracted the likes of Seal and Gladys Knight, while the Korean show even featured Ryan Reynolds (performing Tomorrow from Annie from behind a cardboard unicorn mask). This relatively high-quality guestlist has a knock-on effect on the show’s tone.“With celebrity comes a lot of fragile ego, so in the US version we were taught not to be too savage,” Jeong explains. “They’re all millionaire celebrities – they may not come back the next week if I’m too critical!” The show doesn’t just ditch the eviscerating critique of baddies such as Simon Cowell and Craig Revel Horwood the chronically flummoxed panellists don’t really offer any feedback at all. The glossy TV talent show, it would seem, has also had quite enough of experts.What The Masked Singer can’t get enough of, however, is celeb reverence. The climax of each episode is the unmasking – and the awestruck hysteria that surrounds it. Such fawning doesn’t seem like a very British activity, though: will the show go down as well on this side of the pond? McLean thinks so. “We are British and very restrained but even so our panel was going crazy.”He is also of the mind that, despite the show’s Korean origins, it fits in with our light-entertainment heritage. “It feels like a very British show – it’s got all the tropes of dressing up in silly clothes, guessing games, parlour games.” It is true that there are shades of classic Brit TV in The Masked Singer at times it seems like the unholy alliance of Stars in Their Eyes, Through the Keyhole and Teletubbies.It remains to be seen whether Britain will embrace The Masked Singer in the way other countries have. Will its hair-raising absurdity and bombastic witlessness bring the public together? Can we put aside our differences to brainstorm the identity of the man singing Black Magic dressed as a debonair hedgehog? Will we unite in ecstasy when the haunted bee-doll hybrid finally removes her mask? For the sake of our embittered, ided nation – and the future health of Saturday night TV – let’s hope the answer is yes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3315d3b4a5fc49b54fb6b60338fb4788","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

They were advised not only to avoid drinking the water, but also touching it – no showers, no baths, not even hand-washing.Boiling the water would only increase its toxicity while drinking it could cause “abnormal liver function, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, numbness or dizziness”, read a statement from the City of Toledo, warning residents to “seek medical attention if you feel you have been exposed”.Toledo sits on the shores of Lake Erie, one of North America’s five great lakes. About half a million residents of the city and surrounding area have relied on Lake Erie for water for hundreds of years.After the news broke on 3 August bottled water quickly vanished in concentric circles around the city. Eventually, a state of emergency was called and the national guard arrived with drinking water.Toledo’s water crisis lasted for nearly three days. But the water wasn’t toxic due to an oil spill or high lead levels, as in Flint, Michigan. Toledo’s water was tainted by something altogether different: an algae bloom.Toledo is not alone. According to scientists, algae blooms are becoming more frequent and more toxic worldwide. A 14-month long algae bloom in Florida, known as the “red tide”, only ended earlier this year, after killing more than 100 manatees, 127 dolphins and 589 sea turtles. Hundreds of tonnes of dead fish also washed ashore. In 2018, there were more than 300 reported incidents of toxic or harmful algae blooms around the world. This year about 130 have been listed on an international database, but that number is expected to increase.Recent reports of a new ‘‘red tide’’ emerging in Florida and more dead wildlife have put the tourist and fishing industries on alert, braced for further devastation. The causes of the blooms vary, and in some cases are never known, but in many parts of the world they are being increasingly linked to climate change and industrialised agriculture.Algae includes everything from micro-algae, like microscopic diatoms, to very large algae, such as seaweed and kelp. Algae are not officially a taxonomic group of creatures (they don’t fit into general groups like plants, animals or fungi), but the name is generally used to describe marine or freshwater species that depend on photosynthesis.An algae bloom occurs when a single member of these species – because of certain conditions – suddenly becomes dominant for a time.Algae are vital to our survival. It’s estimated that at least half of the planet’s oxygen comes from these unsung creatures, who produce it through photosynthesis before releasing it into the water. Algae, like land plants, also sequester carbon dioxide scientists have explored their potential to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. They have been used as fertiliser, food sources (such as seaweed), and could be a promising source of biofuel in a more sustainable world.However, some algae blooms can also be harmful – even lethal.Harmful algae bloom (HAB), as scientists have come to describe the phenomenon, often manifest by forming a kind of scum over a body of water that can be green, blue, brown or even red. But others are completely invisible. The problem has become increasingly widespread and the impact can be deadly to marine life.Off the eastern coast of the US, a dinoflagellate – a type of marine plankton named Alexandrium catenella – has the potential to make shellfish lethal. Its appearance routinely shuts down fisheries, crippling local economies. And it’s not just in the US: the same species has shut down mussel farms and recreational collecting of shellfish as far away as New Zealand.Other blooms wipe out marine life. In 2015, a bloom of various dinoflagellates off the coast of South Africa led to low-oxygen conditions, known as eutrophication, killing 200 tonnes of rock lobster. Freshwater blooms, like those in Lake Erie made up of cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, have not only shut down local water sources but have also been blamed for the death of dogs that had been swimming in them.It’s difficult to make generalisations about harmful algae blooms since specific species have different causes and impacts. Scientists have identified about 100 toxic bloom species in the oceans. Dozens of potentially harmful species of cyanobacteria are known to affect bodies of fresh water.During most of the past century, harmful algae blooms were rarely headline news, inspiring little scientific study beyond ecological curiosity. That has changed. Algae blooms are notoriously difficult to predict, but a global monitoring group known as HAEDAT is tracking them across the world as they occur. Harmful algae blooms, such as the one that hit Toledo’s water supply in 2014, are becoming more common and more toxic – and scientists say humans are to blame.“There’s no question that the HAB problem is a major global issue, and it is growing,” said Donald Anderson, director of the US National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms and a lab director at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. “We also have more toxins, more toxic species, more areas and resources affected, and higher economic losses.” The toxic bloom that took over Lake Erie in 2014 was formed by a cyanobacteria known as Microcystis Aeruginosa, for which farming is at least partly to blame.“You have people that still to this day will only use bottled water,” says Dr Timothy Davis, an expert in plankton ecology at Bowling Green University, five years after the water crisis and even after Toledo spent $132 million (£101 million) on improving its water treatment plant to handle the blue-green algae.Lake Erie, the shallowest of North America’s Great Lakes, has seen such events in the past. During the 1950s and 60s algae blooms were common, most likely, say researchers, due to poor domestic and industrial wastewater treatment.“At one point, Lake Erie was considered a dead lake,” Davis says. But by the early 1970s, the “dead lake” was resurrected, due to new regulations from the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement that capped phosphorus loads into the lake at 11,000 tonnes. Phosphorus provides nutrients to plants and is commonly found in manure and produced for fertiliser.Then in the late-1990s, blooms began to reappear. A cyanobacteria bloom requires two things: nutrients and heat. In the case of Lake Erie, nearby farms have become increasingly reliant on large inputs of synthetic fertiliser.“If you have an agricultural system where the farmer can only survive by polluting Lake Erie, then there’s something fundamentally wrong with that system,” says Dr Thomas Bridgeman, director of the Lake Erie Center.Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has seen a bloom every year – and they appear to be lasting longer and getting larger. This year’s bloom in Lake Erie was the fifth largest since 2002 – when monitoring began in earnest. It was 620 square miles at its largest after growing throughout August, before dissipating in September.Meanwhile, climate change has heated up our planet substantially. Nearby Lake Superior, the most northerly of the Great Lakes and the world’s largest, has had its first documented cyanobacteria blooms over the past decade. Before climate change, the lake simply would have been too cold for a long-lasting bloom.It’s now almost a certainty that blooms will continue to appear every summer, say researchers, unless Ohio changes its agricultural practices and the global community finally tackles the climate crisis.“We have to look around and say, ‘Look, what do we grow here?’” says Bridgeman. “We grow corn and soya beans. Where does the corn go? It goes into our gas tanks. Where do the soya beans go? They go to China, they go to hogs. Is that really what we want to be doing with our watershed?”Algal blooms are also becoming more common and severe in many parts of our oceans, harming wildlife and posing potentially dangerous health impacts for local communities.Scientists say the “red tide” that stuck around the Florida coast from 2017 through to this year may now be a semi-normal part of the ecosystem.These blooms are pumping poison into the air, known as brevetoxin, which may be harmful to humans if inhaled. Anyone breathing it in can suffer from uncontrollable coughing and a sore throat. “It doesn’t make for a pleasant day at the beach,” says Malcolm McFarland, a researcher into algae blooms with the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute in Fort Pierce, Florida.It may have long-term health implications as well – one study found that brevetoxin attacked the DNA of lungs in rats, but further research is needed to understand the impact on human health.Scientists are less certain about the causes of these red tide marine blooms, but both nutrient runoff and climate change may play a role. “The red tide seems to initiate and peak in the rainy season when runoff from the land is highest, and nutrient inputs to freshwater and coastal water bodies spike,” says McFarland.Meanwhile, on the other side of the north American continent, a different red tide is attacking a different species: California is seeing more sick sea lions taken in by rescue centres pups and adults are dying.Scientists believe they are suffering from eating fish tainted by Pseudo-nitzschia australis algae. The highly toxic algae are fatal at high doses, both to sea lions and humans.Unlike Florida’s red tides, those in California appear to be a very recent arrival. Until the turn of the millennium, large-scale toxic blooms were rare off the coast of California. Then something changed.Europe has had its own experience of deadly algae blooms that now threaten the future of its fisheries. Last year, the Baltic Sea experienced a bloom so large it could have encompassed Manhattan, and it closed beaches from Finland to Poland. Finland has been systematically sampling its area of the Baltic since 1979, giving us a clearer idea of the spread and growth of the problem, and what’s to blame. In that time, blooms have become larger and longer-lasting, creating dead zones and depleting Baltic fisheries.Like the example in Lake Erie, the Baltic bloom is caused by an influx of nitrogen from agriculture and warming waters.Scientists are regularly tracking nutrient loads from Finland’s rivers into the sea. Data from 2014 in the HELCOM Pollution Load Compilation database, the best currently available, found that more than three-quarters of the nutrient load coming into the Archipelago Sea is from agriculture. The number is surprisingly similar to the proportion coming from industrialised agriculture in Ohio.The Baltic is a brackish water body, thus supporting blooms typical of both fresh and salt water. But, as in Lake Erie, of real concern are cyanobacteria: several species have been known to produce blooms here.Below the sea’s surface there has been a decline in the more nutritious phytoplankton – and food for fish – and an increase in the potentially toxic cryptophytes in the more southerly parts of the sea since the early 1980s.Milder winters and increased rainfall pushing more nutrients into the sea, along with higher surface water temperatures – all due to the climate crisis – are also exacerbating factors, say researchers. Blooms usually begin in July and disappear by August or September. But last year a species particularly resistant to coldremained until November. “The ice was blue-green because of the cyanobacteria under it,” says Sirpa Lehtinen, an expert on plankton for the Marine Research Centre with the Finnish Environmental Institute, who adds that scientists are still trying to work out what this all means for the marine ecosystem, and whether fisheries in the Baltic are in serious long-term peril.So how can we solve a problem like algae? The answer, says Davis, will be part-regional, part-global solutions. For Lake Erie, it will require agricultural changes – including regulations to reduce the nutrient load – and tackling the climate crisis. But solutions elsewhere may be different, for example, blooms in developing countries might require better wastewater treatment.The 2014 water crisis in Ohio forced the issue politically which hasn’t happened in many other places. Governor Mike DeWine recently announced an initiative called H2Ohio, which is expected to include hundreds of millions of dollars for Lake Erie and other Ohio water bodies over the next 10 years. However, scientists say this is not enough.“It’s going to take a lot more money and a lot more political will than what’s happening right now,” says Bridgeman.At the Ohio Department of Agriculture,director Dorothy Pelanda said the department was primarily looking at voluntary programmes based on marketing and education for potential solutions such as cover crops and smarter use of fertiliser. In 2014, Ohio passed new regulations on fertiliser use for farms near the lake: such as not spreading before a storm or on frozen fields.“We know from science that there is not one solution to every farm … It’s about education, it’s about being sensitive to what works, what doesn’t work,” she said. She’s hoping to provide increased access for farmers to use high-tech, but often expensive, equipment that can give them a better idea of what parts of their land may need fertiliser and how much.Pelanda said she’s also seen interest in ersifying crops beyond corn and soya beans, to grapes, chestnuts and maple sugar. Asked if voluntary programmes will go far enough, Pelanda says: “That’s our challenge. We have to get beyond. We’re doing these things … but we’re not doing enough of these things. We need to really increase the voluntary adoption of these practices.”Others are more sceptical of voluntary approaches. “We have a long history in this country of a farmer does what he wants on his land. You can choose to take advantage of a programme or something, but you can also choose not to,” says Bridgeman, who believes local and federal governments can no longer afford to ignore the climate emergency. “We need to do something about climate change and we’re either going to be paying for it by reducing greenhouse gases or we’re going to be paying for it by additional treatment of water,” says Bridgeman, adding that most of the blooms around the world have a human element to them.One thing is certain. Algae blooms aren’t going away but are yet another sign – like ocean acidification, vanishing Arctic sea ice, and mass extinction of the Anthropocene – “of an ecosystem that is out of balance,” says McFarland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/216ce461bc6e394277cdb01d49cc7d2916857cf0/0_47_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98925d437bb125e128c413e2cfe635d4","title":"tougher penalties needed curb surge fly tipping uk councils","story":"More than a million incidents of illegal rubbish dumping were recorded in the financial year 2018-19, which cost councils £58m to clean up. Most incidents involved household waste being jettisoned from cars or vans by the side of a road.“Fly-tipping is not only an illegal, inexcusable and ugly blight on society, it is a serious public health risk,” said David Renard, the environment spokesman for the Local Government Association and leader of Swindon borough council. “Councils are determined to crack down on the problem. However, tougher sentences are needed to act as a stronger deterrent to criminals dumping waste.“This is why we want to work with the government on reviewing sentencing guidelines for fly-tipping, so offenders are given bigger fines for more serious offences, and ensure councils have the funding needed to investigate incidents.”The underlying causes of the rising trend in fly-tipping are not known for certain, but council officials say they have seen a rise in “man in a van” incidents, where unlicensed operators collect rubbish then dump it.Stricter rules at council tips and charges for some refuse disposal may also be a factor. However, an increase in reporting could be responsible for part of the rise, as councils are providing more ways in which members of the public can report rubbish dumping.Fly-tipping incidents in England fell from 1.3m in 2007-08 to 0.7m in 2012-13, according to government data. But there has been a steady rise since then to 1.1m in 2018-19. Total fines of £1m were levied last year.Recent incidents include a delivery driver caught fly-tipping on four occasions in Hertfordshire being fined £300. In Wiltshire, a man advertising a cheap waste clearance service on Facebook was in fact fly-tipping the rubbish. He was fined £3,275.“If someone offers to take your waste away cheaply, it will probably end up being fly-tipped in our beautiful countryside,” said the Wiltshire councillor Bridget Wayman. “You may also find yourself with a £200 fixed penalty notice and a bill for the clear-up costs.” She advised people to check that operators are properly licensed.Fly-tipping has fallen by half in Wolverhampton after its council launched a “shop a tipper” campaign in January, where residents receive a £100 gift voucher for information leading to a fine or successful prosecution.The council has also crushed two transit vans and two cars caught fly-tipping on CCTV. “We do not want fly-tipping in our city. If you don’t pay the fine, we will seize your vehicle and if you don’t come forward to claim it, it will be crushed,” said one councillor, Steve Evans.South Cambridgeshire district council is also trialling a new approach, with signs at hotspots asking “Why are you fly-tipping?” Among the multiple choice answers on the sign are “I want you to prosecute me” and “My mum still cleans up after me”.“Fly tipping is an unacceptable blight on our environment,” said environment secretary Theresa Villiers. “We’re cracking down on it. But I am clear that more must be done to stop these criminals. That is why our Resources and Waste Strategy includes a commitment to strengthen sentencing for fly-tipping.”Penalties were increased in 2014 for a different environmental crime: water pollution. In the nine years to 2013, water companies were punished for more than 1,000 incidents, but fined a total of only £3.5m. But since the change, the fines have been much larger, with Thames Water alone being fined £20m in 2017 after huge leaks of untreated sewage into the Thames and its tributaries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/772cfac6816011a621e19db3515a87578b6b2b06/0_0_4068_2712/master/4068.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af7a3f6babc2123ffd17a0debc32af04 720w","title":"the best high street makeup products","story":"We take mid-priced brands for granted – but neglect them at our peril  This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Apple TV+ landed in November with less of a bang than expected: there was more confusion over technical matters of access than there should have been from a tech corporation of this magnitude, and its initial bouquet of programming underwhelmed. Only all-star drama series The Morning Show, despite mixed reviews, punched through into public consciousness, while Apple’s plans to take on Netflix in the prestige film stakes got off to a rocky start. A day before its premiere, potential Oscar contender The Banker was dropped from the schedule after sexual abuse allegations were levelled against one of its producers.Another heavily hyped streaming service finally hit the UK in the autumn. Two years after its popular US launch, we got BritBox, intended as an amalgamation of top programming from the BBC and ITV. It has been warily regarded in some quarters. “Why pay a monthly subscription for the free-to-air content covered by my licence fee,” runs the argument – not helped by a robust improvement to the Beeb’s trusty iPlayer service, which last year announced it would be keeping content to stream for up to a year rather than the previously stipulated 30 days. Still, BritBox has announced itself as a go-to spot for classic comedy and comfort viewing in the Midsomer Murders vein. Whether its reputation gets any sexier than that in 2020 remains to be seen.As for the year ahead, Disney+ naturally looms largest. When, at last, it arrives in the UK on 31 March – nearly five months after its glitzy Stateside debut – it’s hard to says whose sighs of relief will be loudest: parents impatient for the shiniest non-human babysitting service going, or Star Wars nerds champing at the bit for every new episode of The Mandalorian, the spin-off series that made Baby Yoda an exhausted internet meme well before the rest of the world even got to see it. (The preview episodes I’ve seen promise a knowingly silly space-horse-opera with more of a Saturday-matinee spirit of fun than The Rise of Skywalker.)Disney+ is already making its presence felt by absence elsewhere: Sky and Now TV subscribers may have noticed a heap of Disney-owned programming, from Marvel series to Grey’s Anatomy, vanishing from the service’s menu in recent days. On the flipside, a renewed deal between Sky and HBO means the most anticipated new US streaming service of 2020 – the glossy-looking HBO Max – is unlikely to be headed our way too. (Between this and the ongoing American exclusivity of outlets ranging from mainstream major Hulu to artsy Filmstruck replacement Criterion Channel, British viewers continue to lag behind in terms of streaming options.)Meanwhile, after that aforementioned soft start, Apple TV+ is looking to kick things up a notch this year. A deal for multiple TV series developed by Alfonso Cuarón should help, while Sofia Coppola’s new film On the Rocks will inaugurate its production partnership with high-end indie studio A24.Still, they’ve a long way to catch up with Netflix, whose 2020 film slate is positively mouthwatering. After making another run at the top Oscars with The Irishman and Marriage Story, it’ll be bringing us new films from David Fincher (the Hollywood biopic Mank), Charlie Kaufman (I’m Thinking of Ending Things), Andrew Dominik (his long-in-the-works adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates’s Blonde), Spike Lee (Da 5 Bloods) and George Clooney (Good Morning Midnight), among others. For all the next big things jostling for space in 2020, some big things look to remain very big indeed.Hustlers(Sony, 15)Lorene Scafaria’s fact-based yarn about a group of New York strippers defrauding the Wall Street elite deserved its surprise-hit status last year.

The lowest-ranked team – Fylde are 21st in the National League – left in this season’s FA Cup are preparing for what the club’s president says is by far the biggest occasion in their remarkable history on Sunday, when they travel to Sheffield United.It is the first time Fylde have reached the third round of the Cup and is the latest landmark in the history of a club that has been through three stadiums, one name change and countless promotions in the past 25 years alone. But it was not always this exciting. “I used to play for Kirkham Town in the 1960s, the precursor of Fylde, and it was literally one man and his dog,” Davies recalls.Kirkham merged with Wesham in 1988, after which as Kirkham \u0026amp Wesham FC, they became a mainstay of the West Lancashire League, level 11 on the football pyramid. Davies, who had forged a successful career away from football, was asked to come back on board in 1994, and he remembers well what he encountered.“It’s not that long ago you’d be lucky to have 30 people watching us – and most of those were walking their dogs around the local field,” Davies says. “It didn’t take me long to ask people what they wanted from Kirkham \u0026amp Wesham. If the people involved wanted it to be a pub team, then fine – but that wasn’t for me.” Thankfully, the club’s committee of volunteers bought into what Davies felt he could offer.With his considerable financial backing, the club began to dominate the Lancashire scene, winning the West Lancashire League’s Premier Division seven times in eight years. But they were regularly refused promotion to the North West Counties League owing to their facility on Coronation Road, which was nothing more than a council-owned playing field. “It got to the stage where we had to move on,” Davies says. “We got a fantastic site elsewhere, and that was the springboard for us to kick on again.”They moved to Kellamergh Park in nearby Warton, and for the club’s first game in the North West Counties League 101 people turned up. However, by the end of that season, a pivotal moment in Fylde’s history had arrived. In their first season in the competition they travelled to Wembley and won the FA Vase. That summer it was time to change again. “Fylde is an area of local villages and it’s quite parochial,” Davies says. “People all around here would never support a team with the name Kirkham attached to it if they weren’t from Kirkham, so we had to become Fylde and spread our wings.”Fylde continued to scale the leagues, helped by the investment of Davies’s close friend David Haythornthwaite. Together, they have brought Fylde from the playing fields of Kirkham to the verge of the Football League, having narrowly lost out to Salford in last season’s play-off final. This season has not been as successful, but on Sunday, a trip to face a side 104 places higher in the pyramid is their reward for reaching the third round of the FA Cup for the first time.“I think it’s got to be the biggest occasion we’ve ever experienced,” Davies says of Sunday’s game. “That’s why football is so great. It’s huge for a non-league club. We’ve generated over £100,000 in prize money already and we’re not done yet. We want to go and create a big upset.”Given how Fylde have made no secret of their desire to spend money to achieve their dream of reaching the Football League – coupled with their location – comparisons to the similar journey of Fleetwood are frequent. “Other non-league clubs actually spell Fylde with a pound sign at the start instead of the F,” he laughs. “I’ve every respect for Andy Pilley and Fleetwood, but this isn’t Fleetwood II: this is Fylde doing it Fylde’s way.”The club moved into Mill Farm, an £18m purpose-built development, three years ago, and managed to lure the Football League’s longest-serving manager, Jim Bentley, away from Morecambe in October.“The stadium is signed over to the football club – we’re building a legacy here,” Davies says. “We won’t just disappear with all the money one day like you’ve seen at other places. This is for the future of Fylde. Sunday is a day for people who have been with us on this journey – from the playing fields in front of 30 people to hopefully a big crowd that puts Fylde in a good light this weekend.”Nobody deserves to enjoy that day in the spotlight more than Davies – but there is a slight problem in that regard. “I’m not going to be there I’m booked on a bloody cruise in the Caribbean,” Davies laughs. “My wife was booking the tickets and I told her to put AN Other on mine so someone else could go, but that didn’t go down well. But I’m hoping I’ll see Fylde in the fourth round. Who knows what will happen? It is the FA Cup after all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2bb20ce1ad013ff7a620e3a570c03bf067c6030/0_53_3400_2041/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f302b5cb2276b1bd6cb3f7f89d56af11","title":"premier league winners losers","story":"Could Liverpool blow it? Should Brighton and West Ham be confident of staying up? Can Bournemouth carry on surviving? Can Jamie Vardy keep scoring to win the golden boot?In a word: no. Jürgen Klopp’s side have succeeded in making a total mockery of any notion that their apparently relentless march to a first league title in 30 years might be derailed by fixture congestion either side of Christmas.Much was made of the fact that they were scheduled to play a gruelling 13 games in 40 days across four competitions between 23 November and 5 January but, with just one – Sunday’s FA Cup tie against Everton – left to go, they have taken maximum points from the nine Premier League games they contested during that period.Liverpool lead their nearest rivals, Leicester, whom they demolished on Boxing Day, by 13 points with a game in hand. They have proved similarly impervious to injuries to key personnel such as Fabinho, Joël Matip and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and, even if their current form turns out to be unsustainable, it seems utterly inconceivable that they might suffer the kind of collapse that would allow a rival in full flight to remain anything other than a speck in their rearview mirror.In the absence of anything resembling a close title race, the battle for the three remaining Champions League spots should provide some excitement and drama near the Premier League summit.Leicester and Manchester City have put enough daylight between themselves and the chasing posse to suggest they will occupy two of the berths available, but the chase for fourth spot looks to be between Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Wolves.It is Chelsea’s to lose as they are in the box seat but, like their nearest rivals, they are dogged by inconsistency. Although Frank Lampard’s side have not strung back-to-back league wins together since the first week of November, their grip on fourth has barely been loosened but a winning streak from any of the teams behind them would prompt some serious jitters.Still fewer than 10 points off the pace for fourth with a little under half the season to go, a reinvigorated Arsenal under the new management of Mikel Arteta might still fancy their chances of swooping with a sustained challenge while a place in the Europa League would have been beyond the wildest dreams of fans of Crystal Palace and Sheffield United before the season commenced.Seventh on Christmas Day in 1995, Norwich ended up being relegated and that should prove a cautionary tale for any team outside the current top six suffering delusions of adequacy.This time last season Brighton were 10 points clear of the relegation zone but still needed to rely on the charity and shortcomings of others to finish just above the thick black line. Of the current top 10 Crystal Palace look most vulnerable to an admittedly unlikely collapse.Beyond that nobody is safe but fans of Everton, Southampton, Brighton and West Ham have various reasons to be confident of survival.Newcastle, in 13th, have just lost three matches in a row and, with their treatment room stuffed to the gunwales, find themselves on a slide that shows no sign of being arrested any time soon.Mike Ashley, their famously parsimonious owner, may have to dig deep this month if he is to keep them in the top flight for yet another season fraught with the now traditional peril, disillusionment and rancour. Considering the return he has got from his summer outlay, even a January splurge might not be enough to save his team.Only three teams in the Premier League’s 27 full seasons – West Brom, Sunderland and Leicester – have been bottom of the table on Christmas Day and avoided relegation but after steering the Foxes to unlikely survival in 2015 Nigel Pearson looks set fair to repeat the feat with Watford.Installed as the club’s third manager of the season in early December, he masterminded three wins out of four over the festive period, lifting the club off the foot of the table on Boxing Day and providing genuine hope to the denizens of Vicarage Road.Norwich, the new bottom side, urgently need to start converting home leads into wins if they are to have any chance of extending their stay in the top flight.Dogged by injuries, a porous defence and out-of-form strikers, Bournemouth have taken only four points from the past 30 available and look destined for the drop after five years punching above their weight.Last season’s competition ended in a three-way tie between Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah on 22 each, a tally that looks likely to be beaten by the most prolific striker this time.A rank outsider before the season started, Jamie Vardy has 17 goals to his name already and is four clear of Danny Ings, who has been banging them in for a Southampton side that had until recently been struggling.After an astonishing streak of 11 goals in eight games, Vardy has endured a comparative drought, scoring just one in four before missing Leicester’s past two matches. Level with Ings, Aubameyang seems likely to make even more hay while the sun is shining over the Emirates following the arrival of Arteta."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3350ae8c3a1c96d20ab50725e3785bed9e6b59a7/0_6_2866_1720/master/2866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b16470dd9bd26458b03c0a922cac100","title":"fa cup third round clockwatch football burnley southampton leicester manchester city live","story":"This is great, the end.Peep peep! It’s half-time in the six 12.31pm games, and these are the scores:What a goal! Kyle Vassell has given 10-man Rotherham the lead with a spectacular goal from the left edge of the box. He allowed a short throw to run across his body, waited for the ball to bounce up and smashed a swirling shot that flew over Matt Ingram and into the far corner. It was very similiar to this goal from Steve McManaman, only better.You don’t see many consolation goals in the first half, but Peterborough have got one at Turf Moor. Matthew Lowton’s backheader was short, and Ivan Toney danced around Joe Hart to score confidently from a tight angle.“My favourite third round goal is Shane Long for Reading vs Liverpool in 2010,” says Rob Evans. “Cold, possibly snowy weekday evening. We’re playing well but it’s Liverpool, and it’s Anfield and somehow it is extra time. Reading favourite Bryn Gunnarson turns into Garrincha, throws in a Cruyff turn and a nutmeg before pinging in for Shane Long to score.”“I join Mr. Pearson in my astonishment that all the early matches are available here in the colonies,” says James Thomas. “I’ve opted for Birmingham-Blackburn, although I’m really waiting for Fulham-Aston Villa later. What do the Cottagers need to do, in your humble estimation, to earn promotion, and stick, this season?”Erm, win the play-offs? I’m no Championship expert – I’m not sure I’m an anything expert – but it does look like Leeds and West Brom will be hard to catch.Bristol City 1-0 Shrewbury Town Ah, here we go. A short corner on the left, a deep cross and a precise looping header from Famara Diedhiou. I can’t describe this one because BT Sport are currently on an ad break. Hotels, since you asked.Rotherham 1-1 Hull Rotherham are down to 10 men. Adam Thompson has been sent off for a studs-up lunge at Keane Lewis-Potter. I suspect it was overzealous rather than malicious, but it was a dangerous tackle and he had to walk.“Mickey Thomas’s free kick against for Wrexham against Arsenal would still be rising today had the net not stopped it,” says Matt Dony. “Xabi Alonso scored against Luton from way inside his own half on his WRONG FOOT. But, although it might not be the most romantic or spectacular choice, Van Dijk’s header against Everton two years ago looks like a turning point. He announced his arrival in style, and went on to have a ridiculously transformative effect on the team. That one probably gets my vote. I want to be VVD when I grow up.”Jeff Hendrick’s deflected shot from the edge of the area extendes Burnley’s lead. An equaliser for Rotherham! Michael Smith, given too much time in the area, slams a rising shot into the top corner.“Evening Rob,” says Patrick O’Brien. “My favourite MIKEL ARTETA!!!!! third round goal MIKEL!!!!! ARTE!!!!!TA was MIKEL ARTETA!!!!!!! when ... um, effing love MIKEL ARTETA me.”Hull take a slightly underserved lead at the New York Stadium, with Tom Eaves dragging a low shot into the corner from close range.A neat finish from Miguel Almiron gives Newcastle a deserved lead. Scott Murray will tell you more.Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive, but to be a Clockwatcher was very heavenWe can’t see the goals when we do Premier League clockwatches, which makes for a peculiar experience. Thankfully BT Sport are allowed to show the goals from the 12.31pm games. It’s quite an experience to actually describe the goals rather than paraphrase Paul Merson and Matt Le Tissier. Burnley are cruising into the fourth round. Erik Pieters, 25 yards out, thumps a bouncing ball across Christy Pym and into the far corner. The keeper might have done better.A preview of one of tomorrow’s big gamesBurnley 1-0 Peterborough Pym makes a good save from Gudmundsson’s low shot. Peterborough could be blown away here.A question for both you readers: what’s your favourite FA Cup third round goal and why? I’m not sure I can get past Ronnie Radford.Rodriguez gives Burnley the lead from close range after Chris Wood’s header is saved by Christy Pym. He was offside in the build up, but it was a new phase of play by the time he scored, which meant the goal survived a VAR check. Incidentally, VAR is only being used in matches at Premier League grounds.Millwall take an early lead with Matt Smith scoring from 10 yards after a left-wing corner was allowed too bounce across the box. Birmingham have scored the first goal of the third round. Daniel Crowley, once of Arsenal, surges from the halfway line to the edge of the box and cracks a low shot into the far corner. Good goal, that.Burnley and Newcastle, the two Premier League sides playing this lunchtime, have both picked strong XIs. It will be hard for any of the Small 13 to win the competition, but there is certainly scope for a run to the semi-finals, perhaps the final.“One of the reasons I subscribed to ESPN+ was so I could watch FA Cup matches here in the USA,” says Joe Pearson. “Little did I expect they would ALL be available. What do I do?”Watch Rochdale v Newcastle, and keep pressing F5 on this clockwatch so that we get more hits and The Man labours under the misapprehension that I am more popular than the average Clockwatcher. He might even give me a packet of bonbons.The 12.31pm games are about to kick off. A reminder that Scott Murray is following Rochdale v Newcastle.“Happy new year!” says Mike MacKenzie. “Not sure how practical the following ideas are but offer them anyway to improve FA Cup:I like the first idea in particular, but the climate has changed so much that I don’t think there’s a way to restore the FA Cup’s 20th-century status. Actually, there is one way: football could buy back its soul. But there is more chance of me waking up tomorrow morning with a lustrous mullet.As with 99.9999 per cent of everything Scott Murray writes, this is a brilliant readAnd here’s a preview of every third round matchPeterborough think they will be facing a shadow Burnley side when they turn up for an early kick-off at Turf Moor, and they might be right. The FA Cup has come at an awkward time for the Clarets, who have lost six of their last eight league games, are only four points above the relegation zone and face Chelsea, Leicester, Manchester United and Arsenal when the Premier League resumes. Sean Dyche will still try to pick a side capable of winning the tie against League One’s top scorers, but anything could happen. VAR will be in use here, as it will be at all ties hosted by Premier League teams.Hello. These all-dayers are getting out of hand. It was the Premier League on New Year’s Day, and today it’s an FA Cup third round special. First orders will be at 12.31pm, when the opening round of matches kick off. There are more games at 3.01pm, then a third lot starting at 5.31pm.We’ll have separate MBMs for the two televised games, Rochdale v Newcastle and Wolves v Man Utd while muggins here will attempt to keep up with all the other games. The unusual kick-off times, as you are probably aware, are so that we can take a minute or three to think about mental health. Football has come a long way in the 21 years since Stan Collymore was made a pariah.Alas, the FA Cup has become a bit of an outcast in that time, certainly in comparison to the big Leagues. We’re all friends here, so let us speak frankly: the FA Cup third round does not have the magicromanceinsert preferred cliche here it once did. It will never mean as much as it did in the days of Ronnie Radford, Matthew Hanlan and Micky Thomas. (The saddest thing about the FA Cup, since you asked, is that its greatest day, 8 April 1990, hastened its demise.)It is still English football’s greatest giantkilling canvas, though, and the likelihood is that, at some stage this weekend, a few players will define their careers. Maybe even their lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/923b38b455abc961f7944e14ccc06961b4e6bdd8/0_252_4671_2803/master/4671.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=141998f5e09d3f58ab2bd2e95779080f","title":"rochdale v newcastle united fa cup live","story":"It’s the second half! Rochdale get the party restarted. They’ve made a second change, replacing 16-year-old Kwadwo Baah with 40-year-old Aaron Wilbraham. A 24-year age gap! By the way, it’s still raining.Some more half-time entertainment. “Any time I see the name Rochdale it delights my inner revolutionary,” begins our old pal Hubert O’Hearn. “You see, back in the 1960s the University of Toronto unveiled an 18-floor dormitory called Rochdale College. It rapidly and notoriously became known as the hippie heart of Canada. If you happen to notice any bong passing, guitar strumming, free-love loving in the stands today, it will be good to know the tradition lives on. Mind you, with the injury plight and Mike Ashley to deal with, it might be Steve Bruce in need of a night of pipe, song and sex.” Legal disclaimer: the  accepts no responsibility for the workings, however harrowing, of your mind’s eye.Just the one goal in it at the break ... though Rochdale have Sanchez to thank for that, as the keeper makes a fine double save just before the whistle. Joelinton swivels on the penalty spot and dribbles a shot towards the bottom right. Sanchez stops. Yedlin tries to slam the rebound in from a tight angle on the right, but the keeper’s all over that too. Rochdale will need to make some half-time changes, because Newcastle are getting lots of joy on both flanks, and a one-goal lead is the least the six-time winners deserve.45 min: Yedlin shakes his hips and sits down Keohane. He shimmies into the box and dinks a cross towards Muto, but the delivery isn’t in the same class as the run. Rochdale clear.43 min: This is a little better from Rochdale, as Rathbone embarks on a rococo ramble down the inside-left channel, Krafth and Fernandez both unwilling to tackle him as he enters the box. But Rathbone’s close control lets him down, just as it looks like he’s opened up a little channel to cross. A little promise to take into the second half, perhaps.42 min: Camps tries to stir the crowd by shooting from 30 yards. The ball dribbles apologetically wide of the right-hand post. Dubravka wanders over to watch its serene progress.41 min: Newcastle have done an excellent job of silencing the home crowd. The atmosphere was bubbling at kick-off, but it’s eerily calm now.39 min: Yedlin bursts into the box from the right. He’s got the opportunity to shoot from a tight angle, but unselfishly opts to tee up Muto on the penalty spot instead. Muto smacks his shot straight at Sanchez when he really should score ... but then take nothing away from the keeper’s brave stop. Newcastle would have been worth a two-goal lead, but Rochdale are hanging on in there.38 min: O’Connell looks for the Beckenbauer inside, and sashays up the middle of the park. It’s a fine run, spoilt only by the pass he then clumps into the stand out on the right, while attempting to release Ryan on the wing.36 min: Newcastle continue to dominate possession. They’re in a patient mood right now, stroking it about, hither and yon, happy to wait for an opening to present itself. Eventually Atsu tries to reach the byline on the left for the 300th time this afternoon, but Matheson gets in the road and ushers the ball out for a goal kick.34 min: A corner for Newcastle out on the right. Sanchez claims it, but knackers himself by clattering into the newly arrived Matheson as he leaps. After a brief period of medical attention, he’s good to go again.32 min: Magloire has been run ragged in the right-back position, and he’s replaced by Luke Matheson, who you will remember as a 16-year-old scorer at Old Trafford back in September. Matheson went back to school the day after momentarily stunning Manchester United in the League Cup. He’s 17 now. All grown up.30 min: Joelinton’s not hiding, to be fair, despite his dismal scoring record. Hayden knocks one in from the left Newcastle’s number nine rises under severe pressure from O’Connell and Sanchez, winning a header but sending it over.29 min: Atsu is burning it up down the left, but Yedlin isn’t doing too badly out on the other flank. He drops a shoulder to win a corner. Almiron’s set piece nearly finds Hayden, but Rathbone does enough to relieve the pressure.25 min: Long-distance efforts at either end. First Rathbone has a pop from distance it flies harmlessly high and wide. Then Matty Longstaff has another dig, but this one deflects off his own man and out for a goal kick.23 min: 2019 wasn’t Joelinton’s year. Will 2020 be better? On the evidence so far, possibly ... possibly not. He embarks on a glorious swerving run down the middle of the park, sending Williams off to the shops for the paper and 20 Bensons. He’s just got Sanchez to beat! So far, so good. Then he opens his body to sidefoot into the bottom left ... and rolls the ball dismally wide, bothering only a nearby ballboy. Shame, because that was a fine run.22 min: More space for Atsu, who has the run of Spotland this lunchtime. He lifts a cross into the middle, hoping to find Joelinton, but Sanchez claims. Rochdale are struggling to retain possession.20 min: Now it’s the Newcastle end in full voice. Blaydon Races. Oh me lads. Newcastle fully deserve this lead, they’ve been marvellous so far.It had been coming, and it’s right that it’s the excellent Atsu who sets it up. He romps down the left yet again, cuts back yet again, and Almiron is on hand to whip a glorious shot into the roof of the net from 12 yards.16 min: The Rochdale fans launch into a hearty chorus of the English folk standard Robbie Savage Is A Wanker. It’s usually the sort of thing the TV technicians turn down, but this time, for some reason, BT Sport don’t bother. Full Dolby surround sound, turned up to 11. Once more with feeling.15 min: Yedlin drops a shoulder to skate past Keohane down the right, and should do better with his cross upon reaching the box. Rochdale clear, but it’s beginning to look like a matter of time before Newcastle score the opener.14 min: Atsu is getting all sorts of room down the left. He reaches the white line and pulls back for Matty Longstaff, who takes a touch and sees his eventual shot deflected over the bar by the alert O’Connell. The resulting corner comes to nothing.12 min: Yedlin crosses from the right, having been sent skittering down the wing by Sean Longstaff. His low cross is intercepted and hoicked clear by O’Connell, with Joelinton lurking. Newcastle are showing plenty of menace in these opening exchanges.10 min: Hayden swings a cross in from a tight spot out on the left. It’s a decent ball, met by Joelinton’s header. Newcastle’s number nine aims for the top left, but doesn’t quite get enough purchase on the effort. But the Toon are soon coming straight back at Rochdale, Atsu again reaching the byline on the left and cutting back for Joelinton, who still can’t add to his season’s haul of one goal.8 min: Rochdale get their attack going for the first time this afternoon. Camps makes his way down the left and scoops inside for Henderson, who hooks a harmless effort well wide right from the edge of the box.7 min: Krafth channels his inner Trent Alexander-Arnold, spraying a gloriously ambitious right-to-left pass towards Atsu on the left wing. Atsu reaches the byline and cuts back. The ball breaks right to Krafth, who had kept on trucking. Krafth’s looping cross is snaffled by Sanchez. But that move was both pretty and dangerous. Nice football from Newcastle.5 min: Atsu wins the second corner of the match, bursting down the left and playing the ball off Magloire. Sean Longstaff tries again, and this delivery isn’t much better, easy pickings for Sanchez.4 min: Yedlin rolls a cute pass across the face of the Rochdale box in the hope of teeing up Matty Longstaff. Camps nips in to block and clear before the renowned Manchester United botherer is able to take a whack on goal.3 min: Sean Longstaff takes a short one, and makes an awful balls of it. After Newcastle noodle about in the futile style, Rochdale clear their lines.2 min: Early signs that Newcastle aren’t in the mood to hang about. Almiron turns on the jets and bustles down the left, winning the first corner of the game.The weather is miserable. Rainy and cold. Greater Manchester in winter. But it’s not dampening the spirits of a packed Spotland. A cracking third-round atmosphere, exactly as it should be. Out come the teams, with the hosts wearing their blue and black striped tops. Newcastle are in third-choice old gold with black trim, the spit of Wolves. A classic look, even if it’s not theirs. We’ll be off in a minute ... one minute later than usual. Heads up.Steve Bruce talks to BT Sport. “Newcastle’s recent history isn’t great reading. We want to have a cup run, if we can, so why not? I experienced it a few years ago at Hull. The first thing to do is get over today. There’s a couple of kids on the bench, but the team selection has been pretty easy because we are where we are, and we’ve got what we’ve got. Let’s hope we’ve got enough today. Everybody loves an underdog, that’s why the TV cameras are here. But that’s why the FA Cup is the competition it is.”Some pre-match reading. Paul Wilson talks to Rochdale manager Brian Barry-Murphy.Rochdale are just four points above the relegation places in League One. But they won their last match, 2-1 at Accrington, and make only one change to their starting XI. MJ Williams comes in for the injured Paul McShane. (Does anybody else have this earworm?)Newcastle are missing Jamaal Lascelles, Allan Saint-Maximin, Jonjo Shelvey, Jetro Willems, Fabian Schar, Javier Manquillo, Paul Dummett and Andy Carroll ... but still name a strong XI, with seven international players in it. They make five changes to the team that was trounced by Leicester, with Emil Krath, Christian Atsu, both Longstaffs and, despite a broken hand, DeAndre Yedlin starting.Apologies to Newcastle United supporters for bringing it up yet again, but the definitive FA Cup third-round tie is this one. Ronnie Radford, Ricky George, Supermac, John Motson, kids in parkas, all that.So what are the chances of Rochdale stunning the Toon like Hereford United did back in 1972? On the face of it, they’ve got a job on their hands. Newcastle might be struggling in the Premier League right now, having lost three of their last four matches, but the Dale have lost three of their last four too, and those in League One. Additionally, today’s hosts have only beaten a top-flight side once in 16 FA Cup ties, against Coventry City back in 1971.However, the third round of the FA Cup is the third round of the FA Cup, and so hope is never lost. For a start, Newcastle have only won one of their last 16 away fixtures in the FA Cup. Goliath might not be that confident when he comes to town. And any trepidation they feel will surely be ramped up when they remember Rochdale’s brave performance at Old Trafford four months ago - they held Manchester United to a 1-1 draw in the League Cup before going out on penalties - and the Dale’s 2-2 draw with Spurs in the fifth round of this competition back in 2018. These minnows have form as botherers supreme.Can the Dale pull off a shock? Or will Newcastle prevail as they dream of winning the famous old competition for the first time since 1955? We’ll find out soon enough. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/145e2056586c63ac20f120ec12b23e2b9951a70f/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd5e58975563e5c54bc32b6180cf63c4","title":"liberia palm oil miracle farmers empty promises","story":"Palm plantations are fuelling a booming international trade but the people who live on its edges feel forgotten The sign at the entrance to the palm oil plantation in Grand Bassa has faded thanks to Liberia’s relentless cycle of scorching sun and torrential rain. Even so, it’s possible to make out the phrase: “Your community is rich: Let’s have a fair share.”Several miles farther on, past endless rows of carefully cultivated palm trees, it’s a slogan that bears little relation to reality. Gbenee Town is a small huddle of huts surrounded by a plantation more than six times the size of London’s Richmond Park.The townspeople say that the benefits of the plantation’s expansion have passed them by and they have been duped by a government that took the land they were living off and gave it to foreign investors.“The level we’re living here is very deplorable,” says G Hilary Gbah, one of the town’s elders. “We are starving to death.”Gbah, 54, remembers the arrival in 2012 of Equatorial Palm Oil, the London-headquartered company that owns the plantation. “We embraced the company because we wanted development,” he says, remembering the promises of schools and clinics if local people gave up land.“We were expecting education for our children, employment, healthcare.”He still has a dog-eared list distributed by Liberia’s government. It promised huge rewards if farmers agreed to the clearance of their land, at fixed amounts per plant for crops such as rubber and cassava. “They came and encouraged us … that if we gave them the land then they were going to develop it, all the crops that we had on the land they were going to pay good prices.” People talk of receiving $100 or less for the clearance of crops that could have sustained them for life. The clinics and schools never materialised. One local expert on community compensation, who asked not to be named, said the prices – promised by the government rather than the company – were always wildly unrealistic.But those in nearby communities such as Blayah Town say they had no reason to doubt what they had been told. “They only fooled us and took our land,” says Gbah.Now farmers who once grew their own crops rely on charity or the offer of work from friends in neighbouring towns.The palm oil industry, meanwhile, is thriving. Oil milled from palm fruit is something of a miracle product that has become indispensable to billions of consumers around the world, spawning $60bn industry that continues to grow. Palm oil is found in everything from chocolate to bread, cereal and shampoo. It keeps crisps crispy and stops ice-cream from melting. There is a global process designed to promote ethics in the industry – the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) – but it has limited power to effect change.Around the world palm oil continues to play a significant role in deforestation, threatening wildlife and fuelling the climate crisis. In rural Liberia, one of the world’s poorest countries, the immediate concern is the impact that the industry’s appetite for land is having on the people who live here.For many people in Gbenee and nearby towns, land is the only thing of value that they have. Those who have given up their land, even after compensation offers were drastically reduced, say they did so for one reason alone: fear.In communities from Blayah Town to Qwarkpojlian and Paye Town, elders and women’s representatives recount a similar story.When EPO arrived in 2012 to survey the land it had been awarded by the government, local people concerned that they had not been consulted gathered to protest. The company’s representatives were accompanied by an armed police unit, a terrifying sight in a country still recovering from civil wars that left hundreds of thousands dead.“Since the war finished in Liberia, that was the first day to see arms,” said Garamondeh Banwun. “We were afraid.” Banwun, like many people here, reports beatings handed out by police, some of whom – it is claimed – rode in EPO vehicles.The company is keen to expand further in Grand Bassa but communities that were once open to development no longer trust the process to improve their lives. The alleged role of Liberia’s underesourced state in this dynamic is crucial.But the companies involved are struggling to develop in a way that benefits those whose ancestral land has been sold from beneath them.Historically, few of these communities have been included in the proper consultation process that advocacy groups refer to as free, prior and informed consent (FPIC). James Otto represents the Sustainable Development Institute (SDI), a non-governmental organisation based in Liberia’s capital Monrovia with strong ties to palm oil communities.“Companies continue to knowingly rob communities of their land and forest resources to their disadvantage – posing serious threats to their livelihoods and living spaces,” says Otto.SDI wants communities to be properly consulted over the benefits they will receive – such as schools, clinics and employment – and is calling for signed memorandums of understanding. “Consistent failure of oil palm companies including EPO to fulfil their social and environmental commitments continues to weaken the trust of communities and has dented the opportunities of communities for development,” he says.“Financiers of oil palm companies should ensure that the companies are in compliance with FPIC, respect labour rights and environmental standards.”EPO, however, is not certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. SDI and the communities in Grand Bassa are not inherently opposed to the palm industry, which has the power to create jobs and help develop infrastructure. And there has been at least some progress in ensuring that communities have more robust powers to protect themselves.The Land Rights Act, which was passed last year, is key to that effort. It gives communities ownership of ancestral lands, allowing them to make demands of firms that want to exploit it. But it does not apply retroactively and, in a country with limited state presence, there are lingering doubts about whether it leads to the desired outcomes.In some cases, the new law is having unintended consequences. A hundred miles south-east of Grand Bassa, down a mud-bath of a road lined with the rusting hulks of broken-down cars and trucks – lies the town of Shampee in Sinoe County. Here, EPO did bring benefits: employment and much-needed schools and clinics, staffed by teachers and nurses paid by the company.But a protracted land dispute between neighbouring communities has deterred the company from further investment. Earlier this year it announced plans to pull out.Like many of the staff in the clinic and school, midwife Caroline Weah was a contractor. She has worked in the company’s clinic for six years but has limited redundancy rights. What’s more, she says the company began slowing supplies to the clinic months ago.“They usually gave us drugs every quarter,” she says. “From July we don’t have medicine so the patient load starts going down. Right now, no medicine. Somebody come, If I assess what they need, I don’t have it. I give them prescription and they’re not able to afford to buy.”“What will become of the pregnant women and the children?”EPO’s departure appears to have hit Shampee as hard as its arrival in Gbenee.Such cases have convinced SDI that Liberia would be better off with smaller community-run plantations that could supply multinational firms’ thirst for palm oil and put the wealth into the community. This model, says Otto, is the “only hope for prosperity and development that recognises rights and protects the environment”.Traidcraft Exchange, a UK-based campaign group, wants to see pressure applied through legal safeguards in markets such as the UK where demand for palm oil is created. “Things would have been very different if EPO had been required to consider the impact of these big land deals on local people,” said senior policy adviser Tom Wills. “That’s why Traidcraft Exchange and others are calling for new legislation that would make UK companies assess what risks they pose to human rights, and hold them to account in the courts for any abuses.”Equatorial Palm Oil is listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market (Aim). Its ultimate majority owner is Malaysian firm Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad.EPO declined to comment on the record. However, the company indicated that allegations about its role in violence by state police dated from some time ago. It also said it had been working hard to build consensus with local communities and indicated that the Liberian government had agreed to assume responsibility for the clinic in Shampee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e60e5e5886a7f8b0c8cbbd0d864446b25840907/0_283_5467_3280/master/5467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a5a676cb793cf538640f5df5ce4e31f","title":"empty promises marie kondo craze for minimalism","story":"From the ‘KonMari method’ to Apple’s barely-there design philosophy, we are forever being urged to declutter and simplify our lives. But does minimalism really make us any happier? By  Kyle ChaykaSonrisa Andersen’s childhood home was a mess. Her parents split when she was eight years old and she moved to Colorado Springs with her mother. Then she realised she was living with a hoarder. It might have been grief over the lost marriage that caused it, or maybe it was a habit that had grown worse as her mother’s dependence on drugs and alcohol intensified. On the kitchen table there were piles of clothes stacked all the way to the ceiling, things they would get for free from churches or charities. Furniture that Andersen’s well-meaning grandmother found on the street accumulated. An avalanche of pots and pans spilled all over the kitchen counters and floor. Anything her mother could get for free or cheap, she would bring into the house and leave there.As a child, Andersen kept her own space under control, but, beyond her bedroom door, the mess persisted. At 17, she left home, joined the air force and moved to New Mexico. Over time, her career took her to Alaska and then to Ohio, where she now lives with her husband, Shane, and works as an aerospace physiology technician. But the anxiety over her oppressive surroundings at home never left. Clutter was creeping back in, she realised, even though this time she thought she was fully in control.Andersen wanted all the things she had lacked in childhood, the comforts her colleagues and neighbours enjoyed. She wanted to be like the people in adverts, with their immaculate stage-set living rooms. Each new purchase brought a small dopamine rush that faded as soon as the thing was out of its box and taking up space. As she began to acquire more and more stuff and more and more debt, she began to feel as if she was falling into the pattern set by her mother.She went online for a solution. The search turned up blogs about “minimalism”: a lifestyle of living with less and being happy with, and more aware of, what you already own. The minimalist bloggers were men and women who, like her, had an epiphany that came from a personal crisis of consumerism. Buying more had failed to make them happier. In fact, it was entrapping them, and they needed to find a new relationship with their possessions – usually by throwing most of them out. After jettisoning as much as they possibly could, the bloggers showed off their emptied apartments and shared the strategies they used to own no more than 100 objects. The advice gained them large followings and they began soliciting donations or selling books. Presiding over them was Marie Kondo, a Japanese cleaning guru whose books were becoming international bestsellers. The principal commandment of Kondoism was to abandon anything that didn’t “spark joy” – a phrase that soon became familiar around the world.What the bloggers collectively called minimalism amounted to a kind of enlightened simplicity, a moral message combined with a particularly austere visual style. This style was displayed primarily on Instagram and Pinterest. Certain hallmarks of minimalist imagery emerged: clean white subway tiles, furniture in the style of Scandinavian midcentury modern, and clothing made of organic fabrics from brands that promised you would only ever need to buy one of each piece. Next to the products were monochromatic memes with slogans such as “Own less stuff. Find more purpose.” The trend wasn’t as subtle as its name suggested minimalism was a brand to identify with as much as a way of coping with mess.Andersen bought the minimalist books and listened to the podcasts. She removed everything from the walls of her home, cleared every surface and installed furniture made of light pinewood so that the rooms glowed in the sun. Without buying new stuff, the couple had enough money to pay off their bills and Shane’s student loans. Andersen felt a weight being released that went beyond the absence of clutter. She felt consumerism’s spell over her had been broken. “You don’t have to want things,” she said. “It’s a meditative thing, almost like repeating a mantra.”I met Andersen in 2017 in Cincinnati, where we were both attending a lecture on minimalism held at a local concert venue. We had come to see a pair of ebullient bloggers named Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, who started calling themselves the Minimalists in 2010. Both had enjoyed six-figure salaries in technology marketing, but amid mounting debt and addiction problems, they hit the reset button, turning to blogging instead – blogging about how they got rid of everything and started over. The Minimalists self-published books and accrued millions of podcast listeners. In 2016, their documentary about minimalist practices across the country was picked up by Netflix. Most of the fans I talked to in Cincinnati cited the film as their conversion moment to minimalism.I had been tracking the rise of this minimalist movement and the style that it produced for a few years, but its momentum still surprised me. It was a new social attitude that took its name from what was originally an avant-garde art movement that started in 1960s New York. How could that have happened? Minimalism in the context of visual art was not particularly mainstream (certainly not on the level of Andy Warhol’s pop art) nor even well understood, all of 50 years later, and yet it was also a viral hashtag. There in Cincinnati were suburban commuters and retirees discussing how they had embraced minimalism. Millburn and Nicodemus told me that they had found fans as far away as India and Japan.Over the following two years, minimalism kept popping up around me – in new hotel designs, fashion brands and self-help books. “Digital minimalism” became a term for avoiding the overwhelming information deluge of the internet and trying to not check your phone as much. But when I caught up with Andersen, I learned that she had left her local minimalism Facebook group and stopped listening to the Minimalists’ podcast every week. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe in minimalism any more. It had just become an integral part of her life, the basis for her entire approach to the stuff around her. She noticed it was sometimes more trendy than practical: there were people who liked talking about minimalism more than actually minimising, she said.On one hand there was the facade of minimalism: its brand and visual appearance. On the other was the unhappiness at the root of it all, caused by a society that tells you more is always better. Every advertisement for a new thing implied that you should dislike what you already had. It took Andersen a long time to understand the lesson: “There was really nothing wrong with our lives at all.”In the 21st century, across the developed world, most of us do not need as much as we have. The average American household possesses more than 300,000 items. In the UK, one study found that children have on average 238 toys, but only play with 12 of them on a daily basis. We are addicted to accumulation. The minimalist lifestyle seems like a conscientious way of approaching the world now that we have realised that materialism, accelerating since the industrial revolution, is literally destroying the planet.Yet my gut reaction to Kondo and the Minimalists was that it all seemed a little too convenient: just sort through your house or listen to a podcast, and happiness, satisfaction and peace of mind could all be yours. It was a blanket solution so vague that it could be applied to anyone and anything. You could use the Kondo method for your closet, your Facebook account or your boyfriend. Minimalism also seemed sometimes to be a form of inidualism, an excuse to put yourself first by thinking, I shouldn’t have to deal with this person, place or thing because it doesn’t fit within my worldview. On an economic level, it was a commandment to live safely within your means versus pursuing dreamy aspirations or taking a leap of faith – not a particularly inspiring doctrine.Minimalism, I came to think, is not necessarily a voluntary personal choice, but an inevitable societal and cultural shift responding to the experience of living through the 2000s. Up through the 20th century, material accumulation and stability made sense as forms of security. If you owned your home and your land, no one could take it away from you. If you stuck with one company throughout your career, it was insurance against periods of future economic instability, when you hoped your employer would protect you.Little of this feels true today. The percentage of workers who are freelance instead of salaried grows each year. House prices are prohibitive in any place with a strong labour market. Economic inequality is more severe than ever in the modern era. To make matters even worse, the greatest wealth now comes from the accumulation of invisible capital, not physical stuff: startup equity, stock shares and offshore bank accounts opened to avoid taxes. As the French economist Thomas Piketty points out, these immaterial possessions grow in value much faster than salaries do. That is, if you are lucky enough to have a salary in the first place. Meanwhile, crisis follows crisis and mobility now feels safer than being static, another reason that owning less looks more and more attractive.Most of all, the minimalist attitude speaks to the feeling that all aspects of life have become relentlessly commodified. Buying unnecessary items on Amazon with credit cards is a fast and easy way to exert some feeling of control over our precarious surroundings. Brands sell us cars, televisions, smartphones and other products (often on loans that inflate their costs) as if they will solve our problems. Through books, podcasts and designed objects, the idea of minimalism itself has also been commodified.If I am a minimalist, then, it is by default. In the New York apartment where I lived while writing this, I could look around and count the objects that belonged to me. Not the couch, bed, TV, console or dining table, which came from my one roommate. Just a desk and a bookshelf that held most of the things I cared about: books, papers and a few pieces of art. Unless you are wealthy or creative enough to afford a lot of space, there are two responses to living in New York: one is overstuffing a tiny space that eventually becomes unbearable, the other is living like a minimalist. Without basements, spare closets or extra rooms to stash stuff in, you are always Kondoing.The great recession of 2008 also seemed to usher in a larger minimalist moment. An aesthetic of necessity emerged as the economy came to a standstill. Shopping at thrift stores became cool. So did a certain style of rustic simplicity. Brooklyn and Shoreditch were filled with faux-lumberjacks drinking out of mason jars. Conspicuous consumption, the ostentation of the previous decades, was not just distasteful, it was unreachable. This faux blue-collar hipsterism preceded the turn to high-gloss consumer minimalism that happened once the economic recovery kicked in, preparing the ground for its popularity.Dissatisfaction with materialism and the usual rewards of society is not new, but minimalism is not an idea with a straightforward chronological history. It is more like a feeling that repeats in different times and places around the world. It is defined by the sense that the surrounding civilisation is excessive, and has thus lost some kind of original authenticity, which must be regained. The material world holds less meaning in these moments, and so accumulating more stuff loses its appeal.I began thinking of this universal feeling as the longing for less. It is an abstract, almost nostalgic desire – a pull toward a different, simpler world. Not past or future, neither utopian nor dystopian, this more authentic world is always just beyond our current existence, in a place we can never quite reach. Perhaps the longing for less is the constant shadow of humanity’s self-doubt: what if we were better off without everything we have gained in modern society? If the trappings of civilisation leave us so dissatisfied, then maybe their absence is preferable and we should abandon them in order to seek some deeper truth. The longing for less is neither an illness nor a cure. Minimalism is just one way of thinking about what makes a good life.For some of its devotees, minimalism is therapy. The spasm of getting rid of everything is like an exorcism of the past, clearing the way for a new future of pristine simplicity. It represents a decisive break. No longer will we depend on the accumulation of stuff to bring us happiness – we will instead be content with the things we have consciously decided to keep, the things that represent our ideal selves. By owning fewer things, we might be able to construct new identities through selective curation instead of succumbing to consumerism.At least, that is the model popularized by Marie Kondo’s books, social media accounts and the instantly famous Netflix series that launched at the beginning of 2019. The KonMari Method, described in Kondo’s English-language debut The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, is curiously rigid, with a ritualistic appeal from the process of handling each item in turn and deciding if it stays or goes. Only by following Kondo’s disciplined tenets can the reader be fully successful. Despite her claims that everyone should find their own version of tidiness, she critiques those who follow “erroneous conventional approaches” to cleaning. One must begin with clothes, then proceed on to books, papers and household miscellany. Sentimental items such as photographs or memorabilia are last, because only by the end will you have built up the appropriate sensitivity to joy being sparked to evaluate such potent objects.Kondo promises the illusion of choice. You decide what stays in your house, but she tells you exactly how it should be folded, stored and displayed – in other words, how you should relate to it. When you pull everything out of its nooks and crannies, you realise just how much stuff you own, and how much of it you do not really need. It is like learning what actually goes into junk food: being forced to think about what you put into your life is enough to instill the habit for ever. Kondo boasts that none of her clients has ever relapsed. “A dramatic reorganisation of the home causes correspondingly dramatic changes in lifestyle and perspective,” she writes. Readers trade the orthodoxy of consumerism for the orthodoxy of tidiness. KonMari might be vaguely anti-capitalist, but then there is the fact that you have to buy a suite of Kondo books to practise it. She has been fully transformed into a brand: her company now sells luxury Kondo boxes to organise your stuff in, certification classes for would-be Kondo acolytes and a range of crystals, as well as a “therapeutic tuning fork”.Minimalism was already being commodified when Kondo emerged, however. She was only the crest of a larger 2010s wave of writers adopting the idea. Her English-language predecessors emerged out of the online lifestyle-blogger community, with blogs such as Joshua Becker’s Becoming Minimalist, starting in 2008 Courtney Carver’s Be More With Less, in 2010, and The Minimalists, who had already self-published their book Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life in 2011.The literature of the minimalist lifestyle is an exercise in banality. It is saccharine and predigested, presented as self-help as much as a practical how-to guide. Each book contains an easy structure of epiphany and aftermath, recounting the crisis that leads its author to minimalism, the minimalist metamorphosis and then the positive ways the author’s life changed. The books are often broken up into subheadings, and important phrases are bolded like a high-school textbook. Each one offers more or less the same vision as the others: “I don’t need to own all this stuff,” as Becker writes. Minimalism’s rewards are more money, more generosity, more freedom, less stress, less distraction, less environmental impact, higher-quality belongings and more contentment, as Becker reels off in a series of bullet points. The books’ sameness of content is matched by a shared design of visual serenity. Their covers are all soft colours and soothing typefaces, suitable for Instagramming – even if you don’t read them, they can still be inspiring. The serene covers of these books are just one example of how minimalism’s visual appeal makes its doctrine of sacrifice easier to swallow. Its aesthetic of fashionable austerity is like a brand logo. It is identifiable anywhere, and serves to remind us of the air of moral purity associated with simplicity, even if the minimalist product to be consumed has no moral content whatsoever.The KonMari Method and minimalist self-help as a whole works because it is a simple, almost one-step procedure, as memorable as a marketing slogan. It is a shock treatment demonstrating that you do not need to depend on possessions for an identity you still exist even when they are gone. But as Kondo conceives it, it is also a one-size-fits-all process that has a way of homogenising homes and erasing traces of personality or quirkiness, like the sprawling collection of Christmas decorations that one woman on the Netflix show was forced to decimate over the course of an episode. The overflow of nutcrackers and tinsel was a clear problem (as was her husband’s piles of baseball cards), but with their absence the home was sanitised and homogenised. Minimalist cleanliness is the state of acceptable normalcy that everyone must adhere to, no matter how boring it looks.The most famous proponent of minimalism – or at least minimalism as a lifehack – was probably Steve Jobs. In a famous photograph from 1982, Jobs sits on the floor of his living room. He was in his late 20s at the time, and Apple was making $1bn a year. He had just bought a large house in Los Gatos, California, but he kept it totally empty. In Diana Walker’s photo, he is seen cross-legged on a single square of carpet, holding a mug, wearing a simple dark sweater and jeans – his prototypical uniform. A tall lamp by his side casts a perfect circle of light. “This was a very typical time,” Jobs later remembered. “All you needed was a cup of tea, a light and your stereo, you know, and that’s what I had.” Not for him, the usual displays of wealth or status. In the photo he looks content.Yet the image of simplicity is deceptive. The house Jobs bought was huge for a young, single man with no use for that excess space. Wired magazine later discovered that the stereo setup resting in the corner would have cost $8,200. The lone lamp that illuminates the scene was made by Tiffany. It was a valuable antique, not a utilitarian tool.Not only is simplicity often less simple than it looks, it can also be much less practical than it seems. People often conflate the phrase “form follows function” – the idea that the external appearance of an object or building should reflect the way that it works – with the self-conscious appearance of minimalism, as in Jobs’s house or the design of Apple’s iPhone. But Jobs’s empty living room was not particularly usable. Instead of the mantra that “form follows function”, Jobs echoes a slogan that could be glimpsed not long ago in one upscale New York shop front: “Fewer, better.” Possess the best things and only the best things, if only you can afford them. It was better to go without a couch than buy one that wasn’t perfect. That commitment to taste might be rarified, but it probably did not endear Jobs to his family, who might have preferred a place to sit.Apple devices have gradually simplified in appearance over time under designer Jony Ive, who joined the company in 1992, which is why they are so synonymous with minimalism. By 2002, the Apple desktop computer had evolved into a thin, flat screen mounted on an arm connected to a rounded base. Then, into the 2010s, the screen flattened even more and the base vanished until all that was left were two intersecting lines, one with a right angle for the base and another, straight, for the screen. It sometimes seems, as our machines become infinitely thinner and wider, that we will eventually control them by thought alone, because touch would be too dirty, too analogue.Does this all really constitute simplicity? Apple devices have only a few visual qualities. But it is also an illusion of efficiency. The company strives to make its phones thinner and removes ports – see headphone jacks – any chance it gets. The iPhone’s function depends on an enormous, complex, ugly superstructure of satellites and undersea cables that certainly are not designed in pristine whiteness. Minimalist design encourages us to forget everything a product relies on and imagine, in this case, that the internet consists of carefully shaped glass and steel alone.The contrast between simple form and complex consequences brings to mind what the British writer Daisy Hildyard called “the second body” in her 2017 book of the same name. The phrase describes the alienated presence that we feel when we are aware of both our inidual physical bodies and our collective causation of environmental damage and climate change. While we calmly walk down the street, watch a film or go food shopping, we are also the source of pollution drifting across the Pacific or a tsunami in Indonesia. The second body is the source of an unplaceable anxiety: the problems are undeniably our fault, even though it feels as if we cannot do anything about them because of the sheer difference in scale.Similarly, we might be able to hold the iPhone in our hands, but we should also be aware that the network of its consequences is vast: server farms absorbing massive amounts of electricity, Chinese factories where workers die by suicide, devastated mud pit mines that produce tin. It is easy to feel like a minimalist when you can order food, summon a car or rent a room using a single brick of steel and silicon. But in reality, it is the opposite. We are taking advantage of a maximalist assemblage. Just because something looks simple does not mean it is the aesthetics of simplicity cloak artifice, or even unsustainable excess.This slickness is part of minimalism’s marketing pitch. According to one survey in a magazine called Minimalissimo, you can now buy minimalist coffee tables, water carafes, headphones, sneakers, wristwatches, speakers, scissors and bookends, each in the same monochromatic, severe style familiar from Instagram, and often with pricetags in the hundreds, if not thousands. What they all seem to offer is a kind of mythical just-rightness, the promise that if you just consume this one perfect thing, then you won’t need to buy anything else in the future – at least until the old thing is upgraded and some new level of possible perfection is found.Adapted from The Longing for Less: Living with Minimalism by Kyle Chayka, which will be published by Bloomsbury on 21 January• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05330d550c436fe1913e8c7ed53bc9923268c213/0_110_5812_3486/master/5812.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2264ea7c151c0148fc119aa91d4fd4f6","title":"romesh ranganathan quinoa pants year living healthily","story":"Last January Romesh Ranganathan decided he wanted to get fitter and feel better. Could he stick to his plan?It has long been a source of amusement to my friends that I have maintained such a hefty bulk despite my veganism. It is true: I have taken being vegan as a sign that I shouldn’t deprive myself any further, and am guilty of gravitating towards the junk food end of the plant-based spectrum. I once ate four huge filled doughnuts in one sitting on the basis that vegans rarely get nice doughnuts, and “they were probably made of kale or something”.A year ago, I decided something had to be done. My father died of a heart attack, and my body shape ticked all the boxes of someone headed the same way. There was another issue. My dissatisfaction with the way I look means I tend to wear one or two more layers of clothing than the season dictates. I can often be found at a bar sweating profusely, which, besides preferring the Crawley Pizza Express to the Woking branch, is another degree of separation I am proud to have from Prince Andrew.I have had issues with my body all my life. I was a fat child and only lost weight during my A-levels, enjoying a three-year stint of being “skinny”. This generated a sense of euphoria similar to how Chesney Hawkes must have felt for the three years that followed the release The One And Only. I then piled it all back on at university. The girl I was seeing at the time found my weight gain fairly unappealing, leading to a campaign by her and her friends to “hint” me into losing it. All this has left me with an ongoing hangup about my physique. I remember the first time I took my top off on television. When the show aired, somebody tweeted to complain that as a result of watching me she had been unable to finish her dinner. I assume she didn’t mean because she was so sexually aroused.Last year, I decided to set myself a goal, one that involved a very simple metric: a Wu-Tang Clan T-shirt I had bought online from the US. When it arrived, I realised that it looked so ridiculous that wearing it might lead to a cease-and-desist order from the group for fear that my doughy body squeezed into their merch could damage the brand. I decided that my goal was to be able to wear that T-shirt in public without feeling ashamed. I was not even allowed to do the bigger-man trick of wearing it under an open shirt.I have, of course, tried to lose weight many times, and succeeded – only to put it straight back on. I wanted this to be different, so I resolved to make changes that would be sustainable. I have done 1,200-calorie days and hit the gym hard, and you get results quickly but I also quickly feel miserable (for me, usually around day two). I fall off the wagon badly, before eating the wagon in its entirety. This time I accepted that some of the things I was going to try would fail. I had to: based on the evidence of the past, everything would fail.First I decided to get a personal trainer. Although expensive compared with going to the gym alone, it was necessary because my levels of self-discipline are pathetically low. For example: only six paragraphs into this article, I have stopped for an hour to watch the second half of Jurassic World on TV. When the film ended with a mesosaur emerging from the water to chow down on the lab-created Indominus rex, it made want to have a large snack, which I went off and did. In the same way, when I go to the gym, I can often be found doing three reps of something before looking at my phone, messing with the settings on my headphones, and then trapping someone in conversation by a treadmill until they ask to be left alone.A personal trainer forces you to use all the strange equipment that you would otherwise avoid. My local gym is filled with people I consider experts, who do those weird exercises that you see in Rocky montages, flailing ropes and standing on one leg while you throw a large sack at the ground repeatedly, before pushing a sled up and down the gym like a ’roided husky.My own trainer, David, is an Adonis. He once posted a photograph on Facebook to show how badly he had let himself go over Christmas: it was such an incredible example of the human physique that I nearly saved it as my wallpaper. Rather than doing an exercise and then looking at my phone for 10 minutes, David had me exercising continually. We would move from one station to the next, me sweating even more than a fat man wearing too many layers of clothing in the summer. I also had the blessing or misfortune of not feeling comfortable enough with David to tell him I was dying, which meant that I would often be in the middle of a set and David would tell me to take a break because it’s not normal to be crying.To avoid messing up a busy day, I had to do the sessions early in the morning, often meeting David at 6am. Any later would have meant not taking my kids to school, which I don’t get the chance to do as much as I’d like. It seemed counterintuitive: I was exercising so I could be around longer for my kids, but I was doing it during the time that I could have been spending with them now.I would go to bed late after work, panicked about having to get up in four hours, then lie in bed fully awake until it was time for the personal-training session. I would go and exercise, feel great about what I had achieved for the next hour, and then spend the rest of the day feeling shattered. The breaking point was when I realised that I could cancel at the last minute, as long as I paid for the session. I was soon paying a lot of money to wake up and text a man to say that I wasn’t going to be able to see him, before going back to sleep.I tried a couple of other things. I started going to the gym on my own I tried to run I did boxing training. Running was boring I spent most of my gym time downloading albums on to my phone and one day after boxing I threw up round the side of the house and felt so ill I was late for work. It wasn’t exactly a sustainable way to keep fit, especially as there is only a finite number of things to keep being shit at.Then I discovered my saviour: a spin bike with a screen that lets you do classes online. That doesn’t sound particularly enticing to a sloth, but it was perfect. I could do high-intensity classes, and all I had to do was go downstairs. You get little electronic badges for keeping up a streak, and a T-shirt when you complete 100 classes. There was an accompanying Facebook group full of people who post photos of themselves after a ride saying things like, “Go, team!”I felt pretty weird about doing something so culty, even before the creepy Peloton Christmas ad that looked a lot like a sequel to Get Out. It is also supremely expensive, with a huge outlay on the bike, plus a gym membership-sized subscription – so much so that my wife and I had a meeting to discuss whether it was worth it, based on my predilection for abandoning everything. I found the conversation so unfair that I went and made a smoothie with the NutriBullet, which I eventually found behind my Slendertone Ab Tuning belt. However, the spin bike is the one form of exercise that has stuck. It is difficult to find an excuse not to exercise in your own house (plus my wife has threatened to leave me if I stop using it).Diet was the next thing. I tried to take all of the decision-making out of my hands by having pre-prepared meals delivered. I would eat only three meals a day, plus water, and know exactly what my nutritional intake was. The food sounded very cool: dishes such as Sichuan tofu with spicy pak choi. It was tasty and convenient, but seemed like something a professional athlete would do rather than someone who occasionally uses an exercise bike. Also, it was a bit weird to rule yourself out of every social occasion that involved eating because you were living out of Tupperware boxes. But the main stumbling block, again, is that it is prohibitively expensive – exorbitant enough for my wife to start calling me Jay-Z.In the end, I settled on intermittent fasting. I am going to hold my hands up here: I don’t understand the science behind it. You select eight hours of the day when you can eat, and fast for the other 16, sticking to zero-calorie drinks such as water or black coffee. After 12 hours of not eating, your body apparently goes into a state in which it’s eating itself, or something. I don’t know. What I do know is that I definitely benefited from reducing the number of hours in which I was allowed to take in calories. You can also, if you fancy, only do it six days a week and have a cheat day, although I made the mistake of deciding ad hoc when my cheat day was going to be, before eventually realising I had had seven cheat days out of the last 10. I knocked cheat days on the head.I would love to tell you that the rest of the year was spent smashing out class after class, as I intermittently fasted my way to a set of chiselled abs and being sexy AF, but life got in the way. In August I had to go on tour, which threw everything up in the air.I hate having food in my system when I’m on stage. This means I don’t feel comfortable eating anything after about 5pm, if I’m due on at 8pm. While this is great for minimising calories in the afternoon, I often finish my show contemplating eating a member of the audience. As everyone knows, no good nutritional decisions are made at 10pm. I would often end up going for a curry, so hungry that I would eat 1,000 poppadoms before the actual food arrived.I attempted to stock my hotel room with healthy choices for after the show. However, I was struck by the bleakness of eating a quinoa salad at 11pm in my underwear. I suppose it is possible to put on some clothes, but I made a vow many years ago that I would only ever eat in a hotel room in my underwear and I would hate to break that streak.I came up with a compromise. I decided to push myself to eat a little bit closer to the show, and then nothing afterwards. This was OK as long as I didn’t do anything that made me hungry, like sit at a bar that had snacks, peruse the room service menu, or talk to anyone who had a head shaped like a potato. This meant I had to avoid my tour manager, or King Edward as I started to call him.Staying on top of exercise was also difficult without my spin bike. I have to confess to finding hotel gyms horribly intimate. More often than not, they are like a cupboard with equipment inside. You find yourself in close proximity to a stranger, constantly apologising for going to pick up the same piece of equipment. On one occasion, another man seemed to be doing a circuit that involved every piece of equipment in a random order. I had to gamble and go for the thing I hoped he might not be using next. It was only after about 45 minutes of this that I realised he was probably thinking the exact same thing.I needed a strategy that meant I could avoid a hotel gym and, of course, something that worked in hotels that didn’t have one. I searched online and, as it turns out, hotel room workouts are in high demand. After a little more searching, I found myself doing a set of chest presses with my suitcase. It is as ridiculous as it sounds, but you do feel a bit of pride at having made the best of a bad situation. And by bad situation, I mean having such a bounty of nutrition in your life that you have to find ways to burn it off when you’re slightly too shy to use the on-site gym at your luxury hotel.If I am giving the impression that I have worked relentlessly at getting my weight down, please be reassured: I have lost a bit of weight, but spent more time feeling guilty about doing nothing than making progress. Weeks have gone by where I was too knackered to do anything once, I felt so sorry for myself that I ordered a vegan sticky toffee pudding to my room at 2am and ate it in the dark. And then went to sleep. And then woke up and found I had toffee on my chest. And then ate that toffee.But I have become much more conscious of my choices. When I make bad ones, I try to make some good ones for a while. I no longer see eating sticky toffee pudding at 2am as a terrible failure it just means I need to balance that afterwards. I am by no means an exercise beast, but I do try to look for opportunities to work out when I can. Before, I would have described myself as “sedentary with occasional flurries of exertion”. I have also stopped thinking about it as “falling off the wagon” it’s just an ongoing thing that you do your best at, and then try to describe in a  column without sounding like Carrie Bradshaw in Sex And The City.And without being too corny, I have become more invested in the process because it gets results: I am trying to stay healthy because it feels good because eating better makes me better at work and because exercise is good for my mental health. I use these things to help me get over the fact that there is still no way I am ready to wear that Wu-Tang T-shirt yet.I think the thing I am most grateful for, however, is pushing my belly out so excessively in the “before” photos (page 12) that it looks as if I’ve made huge changes. I tend to think of it more a gear change.These exercises can be done anywhere – all you need is a small space and a chair. They should be done in a circuit. Spend 30 seconds on each one, and then have 30 seconds rest. Repeat five times, making sure everything is done in a controlled way with a straight back and engaged core.With your feet shoulder-width apart and your back straight, squat low towards the ground and back up again.Start in a plank position and lower your body towards the ground by bending your arms. Then, straighten your arms, pushing yourself back up into the plank.Make sure you lift your knees as high as you can, and pump your arms as fast as possible. Do this for 30 seconds, keeping your back straight.Start with your feet together. Take one leg back, bend your knees and do a reverse lunge. Then straighten your back leg and stand up, putting your feet back together. Alternate between the right and left leg.With your back to a chair, move your hands behind you so you are holding the top of it and lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows. Then push yourself back up again by using your triceps – the large muscles on the back of the arms. Repeat this exercise slowly for 30 seconds.

One might imagine it is by now, for the ghost has truly flown, and left a flurry of needles on your floor. Still, let us not waste this moment to honour the tree’s life with a good bit of recycling.If I am honest, I don’t have a tree to recycle because I am not a fan of the Christmas tree tradition. So mostly I have to steal other people’s trees. I go around collecting up the corpses left out with the bins (clearly not the ones destined for the council recycling scheme) and take them back to my allotment.The needles of fir trees make excellent ericaceous compost, perfect for pleasing blueberries, cranberries, bilberries, heathers and azaleas. Depending on your tree, this might be as simple as sweeping up the fallen needles from the sitting room. If you have a fancy tree that’s been bred to never let go, snip off the branches from the main trunk. If you have access to a garden shredder this will speed things up no end. Otherwise chop by hand into smaller pieces, then scatter around the base of your ericaceous plants and let nature do her thing. You can also use the evergreen branches as frost protection they are excellent for protecting perennial crowns.However, you may have nothing left other than bare twiggy stems and the trunk. The timber of fir trees takes an inordinate time to rot back all those lovely-smelling natural oils in the wood are there in part to protect the tree from rotting. So, if you are going to add them to the compost, use them at the bottom of a new pile. A good compost pile is not dissimilar to building a good fire: you want airflow at the base to speed things up. A layer of slow-rotting branches will do just that.Alternatively, the branches make excellent supports for dwarf peas or broad beans. What to do with the remaining trunk? It could be used as an upright in a dead hedge. This sort of hedge comprises all the woody stems too tough or big for compost – raspberry canes, woody branches, that sort of thing – that are then stacked and left to very slowly rot. While they are doing this, they make a wonderful insect and wildlife habitat. The whole thing can get rather messy, but if you stagger upright posts either side of the hedge you can then lay the branches neatly inside. The perfect solution for the last bit of your tree."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b0192c530fce1c0192e1953388a45caf9cc2c9a/0_37_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bd0ef566545c46e29e9332a2eae34af","title":"whats the best way to get fit without joining a gym","story":"I’m thinking of walking or running to work, but I am wondering if cycling would be betterEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.I want to get fit this year, but money is tight (understatement) and I don’t want to join a gym.

Early polling, which gave Keir Starmer a clear lead this week, suggests they are not ready to back the most leftwing candidate in the field en masse.Brexit is likely to be part of the explanation. The party, whose members are disproportionately in London and the south, is overwhelmingly pro-remain, even while many of its heartland constituencies – a swath of which were lost last month – voted to leave.Starmer’s patient and deliberate efforts to push the leadership toward a remain position were welcomed by many grassroots members, though his critics will use the issue to raise questions about his political judgment.Team Corbyn blame the shift toward backing a second referendum for the party’s electoral defeat and ridicule the fears of Starmer and his fellow leadership contender Emily Thornberry, expressed around the shadow cabinet table, that the Lib Dems could threaten them in their London seats.This and the prospect of yet another male leader – “we could be on our second Keir and we haven’t had our first woman yet,” said one exasperated frontbencher - are likely to be used against Starmer in the weeks and months ahead.Rival campaign teams also claim MPs and members scarred by the election result are clutching at the prospect of a Starmer leadership as a safe option, a “comfort blanket” as one candidate put it.The other contenders, including the high-profile backbencher Jess Phillips and the Wigan MP, Lisa Nandy, will hope to shake up the race and fight back by pointing to the scale of Labour’s defeat and the need for a change of direction. This would be in contrast to Starmer’s insistence that he would not “oversteer”.They face a scramble, however, to secure the necessary nominations from MPs and MEPs, and depending on the timetable the national executive committee (NEC) sets on Monday that race could be over in a week or less. Nandy and the anti-Brexit frontbencher Clive Lewis may struggle to convince the requisite 21 MPs, according to some colleagues.The leftwing frontrunner, Rebecca Long Bailey, appears to have made a faltering start despite being Corbyn’s heir apparent. The Labour leader spoke warmly about her when the pair appeared alongside each other at a string of general election events.  understands he has told friends he would like her to succeed him as the torchbearer of the left, but even some of his longtime allies harbour niggling doubts about the shadow business secretary.They feel she has not been tested enough, and wonder whether she might be tempted to tack toward the political centre ground at the behest of restive MPs. “A lot of us on the left are talking about this. She’s just never been under pressure,” said one frontbencher.Some speak wistfully of Laura Pidcock, the outspoken young former North West Durham MP who was another Corbyn favourite, but who lost her seat to the Conservatives and so is out of the running.The party chair Ian Lavery’s suggestion in recent days that he has not ruled out running for the leadership was read by many as a sign that key Corbyn lieutenants are not yet ready to throw their weight wholeheartedly behind Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary.Floated on the hyper-partisan blog Skwawkbox, Lavery’s candidacy is widely thought to be the brainchild of Corbyn’s former chief of staff Karie Murphy, who was a key figure in organising Labour’s election campaign and has close links with the Unite union.Unite is expected to support Long Bailey, though no formal decision has been made. Other major unions, wary of a stitch-up or of being accused of narrowing the choice for party members, may decide to opt for alternative candidates.Whatever the reservations of some Corbyn supporters, however, Long Bailey remains the leftwing candidate with by far the best chance of getting on the ballot paper. As such, she is likely to have the weight of Momentum’s formidable campaigning machine behind her.Other candidates will hope to attract thousands of new registered supporters as Corbyn did in 2015 to bolster their cause, provided the NEC, which has sweeping powers over the race, does not try to limit their ability to do so.As the 2015 contest showed, Labour leadership campaigns, particularly when conducted in the aftermath of a jarring general election defeat, can be anything but predictable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fff1598531d5abd2b104d9b56a852301f06d5da4/630_395_4704_2822/master/4704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca9da50022850a48bf875b2ed6bbaf43","title":"david lammy rules himself out labour leadership","story":"Tottenham MP says party needs candidate best placed to unite factions and win UK’s trustDavid Lammy has ruled himself out of the Labour leadership race, saying he is “not the inidual best placed for this role at this time”.The Tottenham MP and former minister said in a tweet he had been humbled by the calls for him to stand as Labour leader but after serious consideration he was not putting himself forward.He said: “I’m committed to playing my full part in opposition, but we need the candidate best placed to unite our party’s factions so we can win the country’s trust.”Lammy suggested that his stance on Brexit was a factor in him deciding not to run as he believed he would struggle to win back leave voters who had abandoned Labour at the general election.He said he had been emboldened by the many people who shared his views and had received messages, emails and tweets from many members of the Labour party and the wider British public encouraging him to stand.However, he had decided he was not the best person for the job.He said: “A key role for the next Labour leader is to win support from and foster unity between different vociferous factions of our party, so that we can win back the trust of our country. I am not the inidual best placed for this role at this time.“However, overcoming polarisation does not mean abandoning principles. I look forward to making a full contribution to this project of coming together and will back whichever candidate I judge to be most capable of leading it.”Fellow Labour MP Wes Streeting tweeted that he hoped Lammy would be given a seat “at the top table under the next leader, whoever that is”.Writing in the Observer last month, Lammy suggested he would make a decision during the Christmas period on whether to run, having assessed who best could counter the “populist, ethnic nationalism” of Johnson.Lammy said: “The alternative to Boris Johnson’s ethnic nationalism that Labour should offer is a civic nationalism. Rather than basing national pride on biological heritage, skin colour or religion, civic nationalism says that we can be united around shared values and institutions.”The Wigan MP Lisa Nandy announced she would enter the leadership race on Friday.

The government is also urging Britons to avoid all but essential travel to Iran.It has also updated its travel advice for Lebanon and urged British nationals in the country to remain vigilant and issued similar travel advice for British nationals in Israel, Afghanistan and Palestine.As concerns grow about reprisals over the killing of Qassem Suleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad, the former foreign secretary urged the UK to use its position as a key US ally to push Donald Trump to take a more consistent foreign policy approach.Suleimani, who spearheaded Tehran’s military operations in Iraq and Syria as commander of the elite Quds force, was considered the second most powerful figure in Iran. The 62-year-old, who was implicated in tens of thousands of civilian deaths, was killed on Friday morning when his vehicle was targeted by a drone as local allies from the Popular Mobilisation Forces drove him from the airport.Hunt, who served as foreign secretary before standing down in July after losing the Tory leadership race to Boris Johnson, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s an incredibly dangerous game of chicken going on at the moment because both sides have calculated that the other side cannot afford and doesn’t want to go to war.“So they are doing increasingly extreme things, not just the assassination of general Suleimani, but the bombing of the Saudi oil facility last September is another example of this. And, of course, it is true that neither side wants to go to war but it’s also true that both sides are compelled to react when things like this happen and that is the risk in the current situation.”“The UK cannot afford to be neutral if we want to be a serious global player but this is a very, very risky situation and I think that the job we have to do is as one of the US’s closest allies is to use our influence to argue for more consistent US policy. Because sometimes the US seems torn between a desire to appear strong and decisive and influential across every region in the world and the other desire, which is to get its troops home, to reduce the risk to American lives on the ground and to concentrate on the big power competition with China.“And it’s those two conflicting forces that are tugging at the president and that makes people miscalculate because I’m sure, Suleimani thought that the US might not react to some of the things he had been plotting and planning and that was, of course, a big miscalculation. And it’s those miscalculations that are dangerous.”Asked whether he believed Trump miscalculated by ordering the strike, Hunt said: “Only time will tell. But, as I say, I would rather an America that was active and involved in the region. Despite being known for his rhetoric, actually what has characterised Trump is his caution in deploying troops.”Hunt said the apparent decision by the US not to inform the UK in advance of the strike was not in the spirit of its relationship as a close ally. He said: “Well, I think it’s regrettable because, as one of the US’s closest allies, I think it’s an important aspect of that relationship that there are no surprises in the relationship.“But it may also have been because they didn’t want to put us in a difficult position of asking us to make a judgment whether we agreed or not with what was done. I think our relationship with the US is one where we shouldn’t overestimate our influence, but we shouldn’t underestimate it either.”Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister, who has been on holiday on the private Caribbean island of Mustique, calling for an urgent meeting of the privy council to discuss whether the strike had heightened the risk of a terrorist attack in the UK.In his letter, the Labour leader asked if the UK had spoken to the UN to discuss consequences for peace and security and what measures had been taken to ensure the safety of UK nationals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23053b6c729720f985d71f6d4e8ef5e3675da4a0/0_0_5520_3312/master/5520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91665436a8a59d21eebac45581fa82c1","title":"proportion of young people in saturday jobs halves in 20 years","story":"One in four 16- and 17-year-olds take up paid work as many go online to make moneyThe proportion of teenagers working in Saturday jobs has almost halved in the past 20 years as staffing tills, stacking shelves and delivering newspapers have gone out of fashion and people have turned online to earn cash.Some young people are going online to make money, with 2 million 15- to 24-year-olds signed up to the fashion trading site Depop, which claims its most successful sellers earn £2,000 a month – far more than the roughly £250 a typical teenager would earn from a single Saturday shift per week.Researchers also believe many young people are postponing the start of conventional work because they face longer working lives and want to focus more strongly on studies. But employers warn that the decline in teenage part-time work is leaving many unprepared for the realities of working life.“This lack of work experience can create longer-term problems, particularly if they hit other life milestones or ill-health before their careers have got off the ground,” said Laura Gardiner, the Resolution Foundation’s research director.Many of the UK’s most successful people have spoken publicly about their Saturday jobs the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, toiled on a building site, the entrepreneur Karen Brady worked in a hair salon and the broadcaster Robert Peston cleaned freezers in a frozen food shop. The jobs that 16- and 17-year-olds are most likely to undertake include waiting tables, helping in restaurant and hotel kitchens and working as shop assistants.“School leavers and university graduates coming into the workplace too often lack key skills like resilience, team working and general awareness of appropriate workplace behaviour,” said Amy Leonard, the chief executive of the Transformation Trust, which helps disadvantaged teenagers get into work. “Particularly with young people from socio-economically disadvantaged areas, it’s not just about developing the right skills, it’s about demystifying the world of work and helping them to develop the confidence to take that next step from education into work.”Almost half of employers believe young people leaving school, college or university are not “work ready”, according to a recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry.The wider rise in the number of people who have never worked means that a third of people who are currently out of work have never been employed, compared to a fifth in the late 1990s.At the same time, more people are working now this apparent paradox is explained by a reduction in the number of unemployed people who have previously worked and an increase in the number who have never worked.This latter trend is driven not by a group of people deciding to live on welfare benefits, the Resolution Foundation said, but by university and college students working less, a longer lag between leaving full-time education and getting paid work and the decline of the teenage Saturday job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fc26b73335d2d9eaf6b663da2634088824a6571/0_14_4122_2474/master/4122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdbe89fe5fd1c1255da0fabd77bfc183","title":"england cricket south africa second test jofra archer","story":"England have received some rare positive news on their torrid tour of South Africa, as it emerged Jofra Archer is in line to be fit for the third Test in Port Elizabeth having been cleared of any major damage to his right elbow.The fast bowler was ruled out of the ongoing second Test in Cape Town after pulling up with pain in the joint during training on New Year’s Day. Fears were raised that Archer could be ruled out for the final two Tests when he was sent for a second scan on the problem on Friday.England have now issued an upbeat assessment on the 24-year-old’s fitness, saying the scans revealed nothing more than inflammation and that the second X-ray was only precautionary to rule out any damage to the bone.With a nine-day gap between the end of this match in Cape Town and the third Test at St George’s Park, team management are confident Archer will have enough time to recover and resume his place in England’s attack.He could be joined in Port Elizabeth by Mark Wood, who is back to full tilt in the nets and England are increasingly confident he will be ready to be unleashed for the final two Tests.An attack of Archer and Wood – two bowlers who can bowl in excess of 90 miles per hour – would be an exciting prospect, but would likely mean dropping at least one of Stuart Broad, James Anderson or Sam Curran.Since making his England debut in an ODI against Ireland at Malahide in May, Archer has played 22 games of international cricke, including seven Tests. This injury, despite not being serious, will raise fears over his workload and concentrate minds about how best to protect him in the long term.The return to fitness of Archer and Wood is welcome news for an England camp who have had to endure a sickness bug that swept through the squad during the first Test at Centurion.

We had a difficult Christmas period but you have to move on.“We know we are going to have to be at our best against Exeter. I do not expect any drop-off from them after their performance against Saracens. They have been in the top four for a few seasons for a reason: they know that the Premiership is a tournament in which anyone can beat anyone else on their day. If you drop off, you will pay.”The Exiles need a victory after a respectable start to their Premiership campaign following promotion from the Championship gave way to a slump. Without a win in three, they had a player sent off in two of those matches while Blair Cowan saw red in the European Challenge Cup defeat in Toulon last month.Irish are leaving Reading in the summer after 20 years and moving to the new Brentford Community Stadium in west London. There are unlikely to be too many tears at the farewell party at the Madejski, where the Exiles have won only six of their past 22 Premiership matches and two in the last 11.“We want to go to Brentford as a Premiership club,” says the 35-year‑old Myler, who was in the Saints team that won the 2014 Premiership final against Saracens. “It is an exciting time to be part of the squad and when I joined at the beginning of last season, my goal was to have another crack in the Premiership. I feel I still have another couple of seasons in me and being here has given me a new lease of life.“It is not like Northampton, and not just in terms of the club. Northampton is a small town and there is a lot more stuff to do in London outside rugby. It is a different environment and one I think I needed. I remain as ambitious as ever and the approach here at the beginning of the season was not to see success in terms of avoiding relegation but to give the best version of ourselves.”Irish won their first three Premiership fixtures against Exeter, but have been successful only once in the 11 since then, on the second Saturday in January in 2015 when the flanker Cowan, the only Exiles’ survivor that day, scored two of their four tries. The Chiefs were at the end of a four-match losing streak following a hard-fought home victory over Saracens.“They are a side you can measure yourself against,” says Myler. “They are a team that believes in what it is doing and the players work hard for each other. They steadily improved after reaching the Premiership and they are now one of the toughest teams to beat. We will give it a go and the management team here is very astute.”The relegation battle this season has been complicated by the presence of Saracens – docked 35 points for breaching salary cap regulations – at the bottom.The champions went into the current round of fixtures 12 points adrift of 11th-placed Leicester but, if the bottom four clubs at the start of the weekend all repeat their opening seven matches, Saracens would be within a point of the Tigers, 11 behind Wasps and 13 away from Irish. “The bottom line is that if you pick up enough victories, you will not have to worry about what the teams around you are doing,” says Myler. “All we are thinking about is climbing the table.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a8947d43f91fc6f7c15e173fe5668a09771bcf/0_138_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb73973d613d3c8f650ca2cb4a12e5f","title":"south africa v england second test day two live","story":"53rd over: South Africa 141-3 (Elgar 76, van der Dussen 46) Bess starts the post-tea session with a maiden, still floating it up, still doing a job. And James Anderson is spotted on the England balcony, looks like he’s stretching a lower limb. So... Jonny Bairstow is on the field and we think James Anderson is the man off the field... Dom Bess to bowl the first over. From the Sky studio, praise for Jimmy Anderson, criticism for Joe Root for bringing on Curran straight after lunch and not keeping the pressure on. Much interest on who Root brings on at the beginning of the next session. And thank you Marié too, I will read the link asap. Enjoying ’s cricket commentary. Regarding your question about drought in SA:Dire drought conditions in a number of provinces in South Africa, including Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Limpopo and parts of Western Cape province.More information available here:Thanks for the correspondence about the Southern African drought.Firstly, Victoria Falls. Dave Manby writes to say, “The vic falls photo is not the whole picture. The one end of the falls dries up every year in the dry season.”52nd over: South Africa 141-3 (Elgar 76, van der Dussen 46) Elgar knocks Curran’s final ball for a single, and that’s tea. So: 81 runs from the session, 30 overs, a partnership of 101 - the South African batsmen walk happily up the stairs and into the shade of the eucalyptus (?) tree that leans over the pavilion. South Africa’s session, patiently waiting and then knocking the loose balls away. 51st over: South Africa 140-3 (Elgar 76, van der Dussen 46) With a nudge off Root, Elgar brings up the 100 partnership with VDD, and that’s the highest partnership of the series. Just a single from the over - and one more, I think, to be bowled before tea.50th over: South Africa 139-3 (Elgar 76, van der Dussen 46) Curran replaces Anderson and immediately releases some of the pressure when Elgar tucks into a short ball and pulls it through square leg for a juicy four. Though Curran does seem to have the knack of taking wickets early in his spells, so willmightcould make good the damage in the next over. Good old John Starbuck, has the lowdown on cricketers and numbers:I can’t recall the exact protocol for shirt numbers either (over 41), but having them at all stems from the long-standing search for what we used to call Brighter Cricket. The concept was floated in the 1960s but not much got done. I think it was the Australians who introduced inidual players’ numbers, based on where they were in the list of representing the country at Test level, and which they displayed on the baggy green. It was a good idea as it strengthened morale, as well as helping to identify players. Later, these numbers appeared on shirtsjumpers. England followed their lead. It seems a pity this wasn’t done world-wide because it solves the problems of allocating numbers, rather than a new set of rules, which cricket authorities appear to be really keen on, perhaps as a means of them leaving a legacy.49th over: South Africa 134-3 (Elgar 71, van der Dussen 46) Just three easy runs off Joe Root, who hasn’t yet lured Elgar or VDD into the mistakes he might have hoped for. 48th over: South Africa 131-3 (Elgar 70, van der Dussen 44) The deficit is now down to 138, and tight as Anderson is bowling, England could do with a breakthrough before tea. Thank you to Andrew Gladwin for this:I remember the day zero threats in Cape Town, I think they cancelled all youth cricket that year? Terrifying times. This picture from Victoria Falls taken last month is chilling.47th over: South Africa 129-3 (Elgar 69, van der Dussen 43) Joe Root tries his own hand, delivering from wide of the crease to Elgar, trying to complete the over in record time . Which might not please Anderson that much.Some very wise words on Virat Kohli appear in my inbox from Abhijato Sensarma. I love the idea of Kohli being the “unlikeliest cricket romantic of this generation.”Kohli has been the unlikeliest cricket romantic of this generation. Sure, he was always good at batting. But an arrogance was intrinsic to his behaviour, which along with his affinity for the white ball from the outset presented an image of someone who thought he was bigger than the game, especially its modern outlook. However, he has turned out to be a huge cricket geek underneath his tattoo-complemented self. In India, his delivery of statements as skipper about supporting the longest format of the sport has immensely helped in the sale of Test cricket as a concept. His opposition to these new ideas aligns with the feelings of most purists. And we all know that when he speaks, the world listens. Hopefully ICC does too.46th over: South Africa 129-3 (Elgar 69, van der Dussen 43) Ah, man alive! Van der Dussen fences at Anderson and Stokes es full to his left at second slip and clings onto a lip-smacker, only for the ball to bounce out of his clasp as his elbow hits the ground. Anderson contains his thoughts Stokes folds his arms and stares. Another maiden. 45th over: South Africa 129-3 (Elgar 68, van der Dussen 42) Kevin Pietersen not shy of giving Anderson some stick on TalkSport. Just a couple of singles from Bess’s over as the clock hand ticks towards tea. 44th over: South Africa 127-3 (Elgar 68, van der Dussen 42) What did I say? Better from Anderson, who incidentally has gone heavy on the hair wax today. A maiden, that van der Dussen is forced to prod at more awkwardly that he’d like. And an email! Hi Tanya, and a very happy new year to you! And you too, Romeo.It seems rather like Root is banking on a Yes-No-Sorry run out for his next wicket.It does have that sort of slightly sleepytown feel to the session...43rd over: South Africa 127-3 (Elgar 68, van der Dussen 42) Bess wears No. 47 on his back. I can’t just now remember what the rule is for shirts. Do players just choose the number they like (eg Root 66) and the new players get the left overs? What happens to a one-Test wonder? Has he bagged the number for life? Bess has now bowled 12 overs for 26. 41st over: South Africa 124-3 (Elgar 67, van der Dussen 40) Anderson plugs away outside off, not causing any great concern to the South African batsman right now. Famous last words, obvs. Cape Town looking truly glorious, all royal blues and emerald greens. Seems hard to believe the drought that has been hitting much of southern Africa. Read this morning that 25 per cent of Zambians are in need of emergency food aid. If anyone is reading this in South Africa, would love to know if South African too is still suffering from drought conditions. Edgar swaps gloves at the end of the over.40th over: South Africa 121-3 (Elgar 65, van der Dussen 39) Bess not trying anything too tricksy, just dotting it down on or about off stump. Looks brimful of confidence as he always does. Play is heading towards the attritional, think forcing down that last helping of Christmas pudding just to empty the fridge of Christmas. 39th over: South Africa 119-3 (Elgar 64, van der Dussen 38) A gasp of excitement when Ben Stokes seems to scoop up a catch off the floor from a van der Dussen poke off Anderson, but replays show it is a bump ball. Van der Dussen somewhat nervously plays out the rest of a maiden. 38th over: South Africa 118-3 (Elgar 64, van der Dussen 37) Dom Bess, bowling arm whirling straight over his head, think man trying reach the very top of his height rather than sideways for a box of cornflakes, speeds through another accurate over. They potter through for a couple of singles. 37th over: South Africa 117-3 (Elgar 63, van der Dussen 37) Joe Root feels around for the runes and brings on Anderson to a heavily-weighted off-side field. To his fourth ball in the over, Anderson tumbles into his follow-through, actually more into his landing foot. And he continues to scuff away at the footmarks discontentedly throughout the rest of the over, like a rabbit digging a scrape. Elgar leaves his final ball, riskilyskillfully.Something to throw into the four-five-day Test mix:36th over: South Africa 116-3 (Elgar 62, van der Dussen 37) Thanks Adam, great stuff as always, and Happy New Year OBO readers! Sky show-off a fish-eye (?) camera view of Cape Town which shows idyllic blue sky but has all the houses falling away at the side in a slightly queasy way. Which is a bit how England must be feeling right now, what with no-balls and Elgar inching and nugetting towards his Adam-predicted century. Anyway, Dom Bess whizzes through his ninth over without incident.36th over: South Africa 115-3 (Elgar 61, van der Dussen 37) Stokes with the final over of the hour and we get a look at some further no-balls from Stokes. It’s an absolute joke. It’s a productive over for the hosts with six runs collected around the sweepers without risk, this partnership now moving to 75. Drinks! And with that, it’s time for me to say goodbye. It was great to hang out, let’s to it again tonight from Sydney and then tomorrow when I’ll be back for the afternoon at Newlands. Now to Tanya Aldred who will take you through to the close. Bye! Oh, and Tim Cutler on specialist TV umps - makes a very good point as I depart. “A Dubai-based ‘bunker’ with feeds going to a specialised team of trained pros in a controlled environment is the only way forward for mine. No need to fly them around the world. Save on cost, emissions, easily to drivechange policy.” 35th over: South Africa 109-3 (Elgar 60, van der Dussen 33) Bess skips through another frugal over, Elgar right over the splice in defence time and again. I’m not far from handing over to Tanya, but I’ll declare him a lock for a century here. 34th over: South Africa 108-3 (Elgar 60, van der Dussen 32) Elgar races through for a quick single and seems to have hurt his back in the process? At the end of the Stokes over, they call for the physio. Along the way, we see another delivery where he has overstepped. “The on-field umpires aren’t looking for it,” says Nasser. “But doesn’t somebody have to?” They don’t listen to me but they might listen to Nas.33rd over: South Africa 104-3 (Elgar 58, van der Dussen 30) A confidence-building drive for van der Dussen, getting a big stride in at Bess before stroking him through cover for four. The spinner draws his length back just a tad to finish. He has bowled seven overs now for 17 runs. Doing his job well, not leaking many runs.32nd over: South Africa 100-3 (Elgar 58, van der Dussen 26) Ooi! Stokes gets one to take off from around the wicket at Elgar, happy to let it crash into his gloves. Earlier in the over he flicked him for a couple but the main job for England here is wickets not runs. Although that’ll change in an hour or so if they can’t break this.“Afternoon Adam, and Happy New Year to you too.” Likewise, Simon McMahon! If last year taught us anything, surely it was the benefits of compromise, as opposed to certainty. Why not four and a half day Tests?” They’re more likely to go with three and a half days so the TV commentators can get back to their home city in time for dinner (andor nightclubs) by night four.31st over: South Africa 97-3 (Elgar 56, van der Dussen 25) Dom Bess is doing his reputation the world of good here, bringing Elgar forward with ample dip. He finds van der Dussen’s inside edge later in the set with one that really bites. Good areas.30th over: South Africa 95-3 (Elgar 55, van der Dussen 24) Oh dear, Ben Stokes is even further over the line with the first delivery they show up on the screen into his new spell. This is ridiculous on multiple levels. One of those is that the central ump cops a bruising when they don’t call them but they are ultimately skewered when calling them incorrectly. Let’s not forget the Richard IllingworthAdam Voges debacle from Wellington in 2016. Anyway, it’s a good over with the all-rounder generating plenty of shape back towards van der Dussen.29th over: South Africa 91-3 (Elgar 55, van der Dussen 20) Bess is back in place of Curran, straight back on the line and length he found before lunch. As Mike Haysman says on the TV, there’s a puff of dust where the final delivery pitches. 28th over: South Africa 90-3 (Elgar 55, van der Dussen 19) KP was all over this on the telly, explaining how the technology was used in a T20 series he was recently covering to deal with the front foot no-ball line. I’ve been banging away about this for nearly four years now. WE HAD A TRIAL in 2016, where the TV umpire watched the front line in an ODI series between England and Pakistan, and it WORKED A TREAT! The ICC told me then that it would be rolled out everywhere. But, nothing happened. In 2018, they told me it was... too expensive. Too expensive to use cameras that are already there? Odd. The good news is that they have realised the error in this and are going to roll out some more trials in the first half of this year. My conspiracy theory is that the TV umpire isn’t interested in watching the front line on a TV screen all day (toggling back and forth, alerting the central umpire when there is an overstep). It further bolsters the case for specialist TV umpires, if you ask me. Take the job away entirely from the elite panel officials and develop a new generation of umpires who understand the technology intimately. Rant over!NO BALL! OH DEAR! Broad has won van der Dussen’s edge with a brute of a ball but the technology shows he is a long, long way over the line. He’s called back! 27th over: South Africa 86-3 (Elgar 55, van der Dussen 16) Too short from Curran at his pace, punished from the man in form Elgar with his compact pull shot. No issues here. They’ve made the most of the 23 minutes since lunch, adding 26 runs. 26th over: South Africa 80-3 (Elgar 50, van der Dussen 15) Excellent hand this from Elgar, keeping the show on the road after those three quick wickets. He earns the chance to raise his bat with a couple down to fine leg - another poor delivery from Broad in that region - then a quick single in front of the wicket. That’s his 26th score above 50 in Test cricket, 12 of those converted into three figures. Pete Salmon for a second bite of the cherry. “Punishing tems by deducting World Ranking points doesn’t work I think. First, how excited is everyone about the Test Championship. A little bit, but that’s it, even amongst us tragics. And I suspect the players even less so - how keen are they on an extra match on test fees rather than silly IPL type money. Second, even if we were all excited, players included, the only reward is playing in the final, which means only 2-4 teams each cycle will give a toss about losing points. Has to be cash I think, and proper amounts.”We’ll have to agree to disagree here. The players are very into the WTC - those I’ve talked to about it, anyway. They’ve wanted this league for a long time. The problem with the WTC is the weird points allocation but they will surely fix that for the next cycle with some sort of balancing mechanism. It’s fairly ridiculous that Pakistan are third on the table with one win from four Tests. If I was King? I’d draw from the Women’s championship where three matches from each series count and they ensure a minimum of three Tests are played in each. No more two-Test flings! Then we put our heads together on how to keep the other Tests in fourfive match series relevant to the WTC. I haven’t worked that bit out yet.25th over: South Africa 77-3 (Elgar 47, van der Dussen 15) Elgar keeps scoring and it is helping transfer the pressure back onto the visitors. van der Dussen takes advantage later in the over, crushing a half-volley away to the cover boundary. Shot. I’m surprised it took him this long to get a chance at Test level. “I understand the ECB are developing a concept to be deemed ‘The Thousand’ where both sides have a maximum of 1000 deliveries each to fashion a result in the long form of the game,” emails David Lewis. Droll. The ‘exciting, modern simplicity of the concept will be sure to bring a new audience to the long form game and invigorate what is potentially becoming a little stale’ the press release concludes.” Very good. I know it’s tough, and the link is probably there, but let’s try and avoid this removing into Hundred Bashing territory. We had all summer for that, yeah?24th over: South Africa 72-3 (Elgar 46, van der Dussen 11) Disco Stu Broad to take up the attack from the pavilion end, where he caused all sorts of bother before lunch. He’ll want to get a good look at van der Dussen early in this spell but the right-hander does well, pushing the first ball past point to get off strike. Elgar keeps ticking the board over in his direction, taking a misdirected short ball of his hip down to the boundary at fine leg. To finish, one to cover to keep the strike.“Apparently people on the Western Terrace have a song about Dom Bess to the tune of the Divinyls I Touch Myself,” reports Iain Noble. They do??? “As I don’t attend Headingley other than when there’s a good chance of Lancs thrashing the Tykes (which hasn’t been on the cards for a while now) I haven’t heard it. Perhaps you could publish the words in the OBO? Even if it’s rude. Especially if it’s rude.”Well, if that is the case and someone has the words for me, I’ll consider it!23rd over: South Africa 66-3 (Elgar 41, van der Dussen 10) Elgar presents a nice, broad blade to begin and nearly beats mid-off. He does score from the next ball, getting a couple off his hip. Seeing them beautifully, he backs that up with the shot of the day, an on-drive for four. Outstanding timing he’s into the 40s. “My tongue-in-cheek suggestion regarding over rates from a few years ago was to get the players to make the short overs up on the day immediately following the match,” suggests Graeme Thorn. “jJst like in any other profession where if you hadn’t finished your work, you had to come in on your weekend or on a day off to get it done.” The players are back on the field. Sammy Curran gets the first chance with the ball, replacing Dom Bess. He has a couple of slips. Elgar is on strike. PLAY! “‘Morning.” And to you, John Starbuck. “If you want to penalise a side for slow over rates, in a 4-day or 5-day game, don’t bother with fining the captain because it doesn’t work. Instead, in an age when Test matches have a points system for world ranking, simply deduct one point for every session’s over rate failure with umpires allowing some discretion for slow play owing to bad weather and unforeseen events. If this means some sides end up with a minus figure, so what? It ought to mean more spin bowling, which is a Good Thing.”Yep, that’s definitely the way to do it. Use the points, not the cash. Ian Forth has an alternative view: “I don’t really get the furore concerning over rates,” he says. “There seems moral outrage that spectators are being ‘short changed’. But how many spectators actually watch an entire day’s test cricket anyway? At most matches I’ve been to the ground’s half empty at the start of play, two thirds empty at the start of the other sessions and often half empty at stumps. Compared to problems like four day tests, uneven contests, match fixing and so on, over rates only become a real problem in matches such as Port of Spain in 1990 or Karachi in 2000 where a team deliberately slows the game right down to avoid defeat.”I’d spin that to why shouldn’t they get the correct number of overs in? They do in county cricket. They do in Sheffield Shield cricket. The women always hit their targets when playing Test cricket. Why do the men get a leave pass? Back to scrapping the fifth day. “Alternatively, is there something to be said for having the ultimately disappointing result come after just 4 days of futile hope, rather than 5?” asks Matt Dony. I feel like we don’t get many bore draws these days, though? If a Test is going the distance, usually at least one team can win it late. But I’m going on gut feel there, which is always a bit dicey. “Where do you stand on the pitch (as t’were)?” asks my man Gary Naylor. “This time yesterday, most pundits were telling us that it was a belter, when it clearly wasn’t - have they changed their tune? Looks a good advert for four day Tests to me.” I’ll take the second half of that as a comment! It still looks a very good batting track with one very big crack running down that fourth stump line? It could be one of those Test pitches where it is very different from one end to the other. Good fun!“Morning Adam.” Hello, Brian Withington! We’re all here this morning. “Wrote this before seeing Kim Thonger’s query. I am finding it difficult to shake the (unoriginal) feeling that debating between four and five day tests feels a bit like Nero fiddling in the current context of swathes of Aus literally burning (to the backdrop of unspeakable political leadership the world over). So is our beloved game a welcome distraction or soothing balm during these troubled times? As a child I was rather troubled by the prospect of the earth being engulfed by a solar fireball within four or five billion years - my hasn’t the time flown by. I’d love to hear what Nasser thinks about it all - why don’t people like him end up running things?”Good shout: if Nasser ran for something, I’d happily run his campaign. But why would they bother? I saw a prominent Australian footballer post Richard Flanagan’s powerful piece on the New York Times about the Australian fires and then had a look at the replies to his tweet. Why subject yourself to that if you already have a fairly big megaphone as a celebrity sportsperson? Not to say I wish more wouldn’t consider it. I have my eye on one former Australian Test player who I want to run for parliament one day. We’ll see if I’m persuasive enough! More on four-day Tests. “I think it is pretty much the end of society as we know it,” declares Adrian Goldman. Gotta love a strong opening. “It may be, however, the only way that the current England side would ever be able to bat out a draw. And I am not even certain of that.”As for Frank Bradley, he’s also firmly in the anti-camp. “The question remains, WHY? None of the reasonsexcuses cut the mustard. Unless of course the players (As celebrities of course), will put on singing, dancing and comic impersonations on the now free day to attract a different audience.”Why? They say to free up many, many days of scheduled time that doesn’t get used. With that, they can play more cricket. I mean, yeah? That’s not unreasonable as a starting point. But at what cost? Too high, for mine. Let’s have four-day Tests from time to time, when it is that or nothing. As I said earlier, New Zealand are in that boat a lot of the time and they want to play more often. As my colleague Tim Wigmore has argued, two four-day Tests gets a series done in two weeks. But the WTC suggestion is that it would be compulsory - meaning Ashes, the lot.News in from Chris Stocks, who is covering the Test for the paper at Newlands. He reports that Archer is “in line to be fit” for the Third Test at Port Elizabeth next week. The 24-year-old has been cleared of major damage to his right elbow after being ruled out in Cape Town. We’ll have the full story with you shortly. “Morning Adam.” Hello, Kim Thonger. “We awake to find England bowling well and taking wickets but are concerned that actually we are just in heaven following an overnight nuclear conflagration caused by the orange lunatic whose name shall not pass our lips. Please confirm we are still alive and reading about reality?”I promise, despite what the twitter trends say, WWIII has not broken out. Let’s just enjoy the comforting distraction that is Test Match cricket, I say. Maybe they figure with the WTC giving such a high reward for wins (especially in twothree match series) that we won’t see teams play for draws? The guts of this is that they see a chance to make more cash by scrapping day five. The rest is noise.I have a film clip recommendation in from Abhijato Sensarma. Let’s take a look.The old firm do it again. After conceding 17 runs in two overs to start, England hearts were quickly in mouths. But Broad then Anderson found their mark soon enough and ran through the Proteas’ top order before they won the opportunity to cash in on a great day for batting. Malan, Hamza and du Plessis all gave catches to the cordon - the middle of those a brilliant take by Stokes - to quickly get the visitors back on track after such a disappointing opening day. Importantly, Bess also did his job to keep it tight up the other end in his first spell back at the top table. Elgar, meanwhile, is batting beautifully for the home side. Good stuff. 22nd over: South Africa 60-3 (Elgar 35, van der Dussen 10) Stokes gets the final over before lunch, replacing Anderson after his fine spell. Three slips are in place as he charges in at van der Dussen, the right-hander leaving whenever he can but he can’t let the ball go on the fourth-stump crack, pushing and missing at a ball that moves appreciably off the seam. That’s going to be a real bother for batsmen throughout the rest of this match. He keeps his cool though, picking up a couple through midwicket before leaving the last couple to get to LUNCH. The end of a big session for England. They needed early wickets and snagged three of them. 21st over: South Africa 58-3 (Elgar 35, van der Dussen 8) There was criticism of Dom Bess when he debuted at age 20 (the youngest England off-spinner ever!) at Lord’s last year that he didn’t contain well enough. His ropey figures supported that view. He’s certainly doing that job here though, backing his skills and giving the ball a chance to spin by giving it plenty of flight rather than pushing it through. A lot to like about his return to the bowling crease at the top level so far.20th over: South Africa 56-3 (Elgar 34, van der Dussen 7) It might have been not out but what a superb inswinger it was from Anderson to win the decision in the first place. He’s been hitting the deck and shaping away shaping away shaping away... then that. It’s been said time and again, but he’s the most skilful bowler of his generation and surely one of the most capable seamers to ever play. It’s a different game when Elgar is on strike here, the left-hander timing a couple past point before keeping the strike with a tuck. There are five minutes left until lunch. HAS ANDERSON TRAPPED VAN DER DUSSEN? He’s given out on the field but has sent it straight upstairs for review. And he’s right to do so, there’s a big inside edge so Umpire Reiffel has to change his decision to NOT OUT! That’s why we have DRS.19th over: South Africa 52-3 (Elgar 31, van der Dussen 6) Elgar eases Bess down the ground for one - he’s in great shape. Of course, he saluted for a ton at Newlands against Australia before all hell broke loose in March 2018. van der Dussen does the same, out to cover, to keep the strike. Another tidy over. 18th over: South Africa 50-3 (Elgar 30, van der Dussen 5) Anderson once again at van der Dussen, beating from another delivery that seams away early in the set. As the TV tells me, this is the end where Philander was able to generate plenty of movement off the track yesterday. There’s no respite for the new man. Maiden.“Usually I can bet on being on some beautiful foreign beach while following your OBO,” writes Andy Wilson, who I am very pleased to hear from. “This morning it is from a surprisingly sunny Yorkshire.Anyway onto business... I think that the Aussie development of Marnus Labuschagne is borderline cheating. You should be allowed one of him or Smith but not both. So I reckon you should get your pick of England’s top order as a swap. Except Burns. If you had both you would need 6 or 7 day tests just to get their batting in. So swap for someone who can dash to 20 or 30 and the world is a far better and harmonious place. Hope all is well with you and you and family are safe from the fires.”Just think, Marnus probably wouldn’t have played in the Ashes if not for Archer knocking Smith out. Now they are - as they kids say - BFFs. And it shows. And thanks fot the kind words. My family’s farm is on the other side of Victoria, so they’re all set for now. But, yes, it’s a terribly sad and grim time for everyone.17th over: South Africa 50-3 (Elgar 30, van der Dussen 5) Really good loop from Bess from around the wicket to Elgar, getting himself in the game. He has a slip and a silly point in operation, Elgar pushing past that man through the air to get off strike. When he’s back down the business end, they take that man out to a catching cover, hoping he’ll repeat the error but he’s happily forward in defence.“Touches of Graeme Swann in Dom Bess’ action wouldn’t you say Adam?” tweets @Martin_Laidler. “Loopy windmill action (technical term).” Yep, a good comparison. Now, if only he can take 250-odd Test wickets in the next five years! 16th over: South Africa 48-3 (Elgar 29, van der Dussen 4) Edge, four! Through third slip. Root has three catchers back there but not in that very spot. Jimmy has a word about it to van der Dussen, as is the custom when such a thing happens. This is a much better spell from the man with 578 Test scalps to his name."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec1a64d97740fd9e3259dc6483575b7043faaebe/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97488c813ee39bdc2738914fd0152ee5","title":"where to go on holiday in 2020 alternative hotlist ethical destinations","story":"Our pick of 20 places to visit in 2020 celebrates inspiring conservation and community projects that are making a difference to people and the planetOpened last year, the 270km Juliana Trail, a hiking route through the Julian Alps, takes walkers away from some of the most visited parts of Triglav national park in a bid to combat overtourism. The circular trail, which starts at Kranjska Gora near the Italian border, is ided into 16 stages, with most of the daily routes starting at a railway station or bus stop.Bike Slovenia Green offers another way of exploring a multi-stage itinerary through the Julian Alps, around Lake Bohinj and Lake Bled and on to the Adriatic coast. The series of one-day cycling loops visits places that have a Slovenia Green certificate, such as the karst village of Komen, known for fresh cheese ravioli, fresh herbs and prosciutto. Designed by sustainable travel agency Visit GoodPlace, and funded by the EU, the bike routes go through three wine regions, and take cyclists to family-run hotels via quiet roads and cycle paths.Also new for 2020 is a Best of Slovenia By Train trip from Inntravel. Travelling via Vienna and Venice, it makes use of Slovenia’s charming, old-fashioned rail network and takes in highlights from alpine Bohinj to capital Ljubljana and Piran on the Adriatic coast. (from £1,045 for seven nights, inntravel).Jane DunfordThe Hagabion cafe and bar in the central Linné area is renowned for a vegetarian menu that changes daily. People gather here, too, for a drink before moving on to the many other restaurants, bars and venues nearby. At the heart of the city is the Gothia Towers hotel, the biggest hotel in Europe to be certified according to the Breeam standard for environmental certification. Out of season, rooms can be had for £100, though a luxury room with access to the spa and glass-bottomed pool on the 19th floor will cost (much) more.The kitchen garden on the roof boasts Sweden’s highest apiary, with 150,000 bees. The garden produce is Krav-certified for sustainability and, like the herbs and spices grown here, the honey is used in the dishes of the Upper House restaurant, and in its own beer (brewed in-house).For the energetic, Gothenburg hosts the world’s largest half marathon, with more than 60,000 runners. It also has many events for cyclists and swimmers, including the world’s biggest annual swim-run event (1 August). Hire a bike to see the city and explore further afield. Put the bikes on the train for the 20-minute trip to the town of Kungsbacka, and cycle around Lygnern lake. Alternatively, stick to the southern coastal path from the centre to Särö island.There is no shortage of spots for wild swimming at lakes in and around Gothenburg. A short bus ride away is Gunnebo Slott manor house and gardens, with its organic restaurant – and lakes nearby. Typing badplats (bathing spot) into Google Maps will bring up a wealth of places with wooden quays and ladders into the water. There’s canoe hire on Surtesjön lake and nearby waters on the northern edge of the city, and sea-bathing to the south at Näset. On the island of Tjörn, further north, the Pilane outdoor sculpture park is breathtaking. For unwinding afterwards, there’s a free public sauna at Frihamnen, across the river from central Gothenburg.David CrouchItaly’s ‘greenest’ valleyThe rolling Vara valley in north-west Italy is not unusual in suffering a haemorrhage of young people from rural communities but it is unusual in its response: going greener. At the turn of the century, thanks to an enlightened mayor, farmers up and down the valley, which runs parallel to the coast between Genoa and La Spezia, started switching to organic production. The idea spread to hotels and restaurants, artisanal producers and tourist initiatives and led, in 2013, to the creation of the Val di Vara Biodistrict, to represent the businesses and run community events.The area’s Bio Festival, launched in 2018, is now an annual event, with streetfood, games, livestock shows and music. And last summer the Biodistrict started running full-day bus tours of the valley from Levanto on the coast (€47 adult, €25 child, family 2+2 €141, including lunch and tastings).In the past few years, young locals have opened five farms to the public and started 13 agriturismos, offering rustic rooms and farmhouse meals, plus jams, liqueurs, olive oil or meat to buy. Try Il Risveglio Naturale or Il Filo di Paglia. Local cycling enthusiast Marco runs five-hour e-bike tours of the valley – in Italian and English – from agriturismo L’Antico Cornio, with tastings of focaccia, cured meats, cheeses and wine (€60pp, book at foodyexperience).The capital of Val di Vara is Varese Ligure, a walled town dating from 1161, with a castle, medieval churches and a 16th-century stone bridge. On a small riverside square, Pietro Picetti, who is in his 70s, hand-carves wooden moulds for stamping corzetti (or croxetti), the local, disc-shaped pasta – once with prominent families’ coat of arms now often just with pleasing patterns, or your initials! Visitors can have an organic lunch of corzetti pasta with walnut sauce at Albergo Amici in Varese Ligure, before stocking up on foodie gifts from, say, honey and fruit farm Cascina le Bosche or herb and saffron producer Le Piccole Erbe. Dinner could be at the equally organic Antica Locanda Luigina in Mattarana. To work up an appetite for all this bounty, the Vara river and its tributaries offer kayaking, rafting and canyoning (valara.it) and the area is crisscrossed by footpaths including the Alta Via dei Monti Liguri – a 400km ridgetop cyclinghiking route. There’s more adrenaline action on the high ropes and zipwires of Parco Avventura Val Di Vara. Liz BoulterEco-snow sports, Swiss-styleThe Flims Laax Falera region in eastern Switzerland’s Graubünden canton is well-endowed with natural beauty but there’s a particularly primeval air to the landscape here. For starters there’s the Rhine Gorge, known in the local Romansh language as Ruinaulta and more commonly as the Swiss grand canyon. After a huge landslide thousands of years ago, the Rhine scoured a path through the debris, creating what is now a dramatic summer playground for hikers, rafters and bikers. Hikers can also explore the Unesco site of Sardona, where tectonic plates once crunched together, pushing the rock upwards and leaving a distinct limestone line across the mountains.Winter offers snowy walking trails, pro-standard snowparks and 224km of slopes in three linked ski areas. With the highest piste topping 3,000 metres, snow is reliable, yet as in many other Swiss resorts, Flims Laax Falera has recently seen its snowline creep upwards and its ski season shorten. Its plans to tackle the climate crisis are more ambitious than most.A vision of the urban futureRotterdam is a city that’s not afraid to experiment. From the architecture of Rem Koolhaas, one of its most famous sons, to the annual Rooftops Festival, which in 2019 saw 65 rooftops repurposed to host events, Europe’s largest port is a fascinating living laboratory for anyone interested in what urban living might look like in the coming years. There’s even a Sponge Garden for studying how best urban green spaces can be used to capture and hold rainwater and return it to the natural environment.Many of the city’s innovations are focused on a waste-free circular economy. It’s home to the world’s first floating farm, where 32 cows are fed on scraps from local hotels and restaurants, and produce milk for city residents and manure for Rotterdam’s flowerbeds. And at Blue City, a former indoor subtropical swimming complex has been repurposed to provide workspace for more than 30 startups working in the circular economy. “Waste” coffee granules from the Aloha Bar-Restaurant become soil for the mushrooms grown by a neighbouring startup another is fashioning fruit peelings into leather.From 1 May, visitors wanting to immerse themselves in the city’s vision can stay in one of Culture Campsite’s spaces in the riverside Delfshaven district, with choices of upcycled “sleeping objects” including a greenhouse, a silo and a cattle shelter.Although Rotterdam’s main attractions tend to look to the future, it has not forgotten where its citizens came from. With around 180 nationalities calling the city home, it has a claim to be one of the most multicultural in the world. A great place to understand this richness is the Story House Belvédère. This community-run enterprise in the Katendrecht district is part-cafe, part-gallery and part-events space. Headphones lining the walls play recordings gathered from around Rotterdam, sharing the voices of the many cultures that give the city its character, and there are exhibitions by its annual immigrant artist in residence.Jeremy SmithMarine protection and sustainability to savourMenorcans realised early that a sustainable approach to tourism was essential for avoiding the overdevelopment that has spoiled so much of the Mediterranean coast in Spain. A Unesco biosphere reserve since 1993, the island has crystal-clear waters, a thriving local culture and unique gastronomy.The best way to access the white sandy beaches of the south and rocky coves of the north is via the Camí de Cavalls, an ancient path for mounted soldiers connecting defensive lookouts that encircles the island. Thanks to pressure from a local NGO, it was reopened as a public right of way in 2010 and is now much-loved by Menorcans and visitors alike for walking, cycling or horse-riding.Since 2016, the Balearic Islands has collected a sustainable tourism tax and used it to fund local conservation initiatives such as the Underwater Atlas project, which maps the seagrass beds essential to the marine ecosystem so that they are not disturbed by boat anchors. Snorkelling around the coves to the east of Binimel-là beach you’ll find waters bursting with life – look out for octopus and even the odd Moray eel. Last year, some 20 sq km of coastal waters was added to the existing Unesco biosphere reserve, making it the largest protected marine environment in the Mediterranean.Stay at Ses Sucreres (doubles from €95 B\u0026ampB) in the pretty, whitewashed village of Ferreries in the centre of the island, and visit the homemade produce market in Plaça Eya, held on Saturday mornings, to sample the Mahón-Menorca cheese, with its distinctive sharp, salty flavour. Seafood also plays a huge role in local cuisine – Es Cranc restaurant in the tiny northern port of Fornells is known for its outstanding caldereta (lobster stew). Menorca is currently in the running for European Region of Gastronomy 2022.Annette PaceyCarbon-neutral capitalShopping, sightseeing and museums are the mainstays of most city breaks. Copenhagen has all these – but where else could you go skiing in the city centre, or float in the clear water of open-air harbour baths? CopenHill, a huge new urban ski slope, was built atop a renewable waste-to-energy power plant. As well as skiing and snowboarding, it has running and hiking trails, and the world’s highest outdoor climbing wall.For outdoor bathing, there are several options, such as the central Islands Brygge baths or the Nordhavn quarter, which has boardwalks, cafes and a beachy vibe. Real seaside isn’t far from the city: Amager Beach Park is an easy 5km bike ride away and has miles of white sand, islands and a lagoon. Other activities in town include sailing in solar-powered GoBoats and kayaking.Copenhagen has pledged to become the world’s first carbon-neutral capital by 2025. It is well on the way to reaching its goal, so is already a great place for a sustainable stay. It’s one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world, so explore it on two wheels – there are many hire points, 375km of cycle tracks and several pedestrianbike bridges over the harbour.Public transport is excellent, and expanding: the metro’s new City Circle line now links the centre with the neighbourhoods of Østerbro, Nørrebro, Frederiksberg and Vesterbro, and another new line opens this year, connecting the northern harbour.Noma put the Copenhagen food scene on the map with its use of ultra-local ingredients and innovative takes on traditional techniques but there are plenty of other restaurants with great food and low carbon footprints. Gro Spiseri is a rooftop farm-cum-restaurant where diners eat in the greenhouses, and Baest has its own microdairy producing cheese from biodynamic Danish milk.More than two-thirds of the city’s hotels hold an eco-certificate. One of the newest is the industrial-chic Hotel Ottilia (doubles from £120 B\u0026ampB), converted from two former brewery buildings in the emerging Carlsberg City district. It serves an organic breakfast, has a free “wine hour” from 5pm-6pm and the rooftop restaurant has views over the city.To get to Copenhagen from the UK without flying, take the Eurostar and onward trains to Brussels, Cologne or Hamburg, stay overnight, then continue to Copenhagen the next morning. (Stopping at one city on the way there and another on the way back adds to the fun.) Details at seat61Rachel DixonThe public rental bike system, Citybike Vienna, allows you to crisscross cobblestone streets to canalside avenues and sample the 300km of paths on the Wienerwald Cycle Route and the extensive Danube Cycle Path.The city has spent €8m on tree planting as part of initiatives to redesign parks and streets. Zieglergasse in the 7th district is Vienna’s first climate-adapted street, completed in December 2019. With drinking fountains, cooling arches, garden and shaded areas, alongside more space for bikes, it has been dubbed the “Cool Mile”. Nearby Neubaugasse, in the same district, will unveil a similar redesign in mid-January, for planned completion by autumn. Construction of a “Cooling Park” in the adjacent 6th district’s Esterházypark is due in spring 2020, and will include two “climate trees” made of three-metre-high mist showers within an expanded shaded, green space.Urban gardening is common, on organic city farms and private allotments, aided by some of the city’s 200 million bees in beehives atop the Vienna State Opera, the Burgtheater and the Old General Hospital. Some districts hold weekly local farmers’ markets, although the main central markets of Naschmarkt, Karmelitermarkt and Brunnenmarkt at Yppenplatz all feature local vendors selling organic produce. Access to fresh mountain water is the norm, with 1,000 free drinking fountains throughout the city.Vienna is proud of its affordable and accessible transport system: the annual inner-city transport card costs €1 a day. With a focus on lowering car usage, the Friday Nightskating event invites people to take to the streets on skates and bikes, as a way to encourage people to see the city without noise or pollution. A push to get more people to use the extensive rail network is backed by Austria’s train operator, OBB. The addition of services to Brussels and northern Romania, on top of routes to neighbouring countries, will establish Vienna as the best-connected city by rail in Europe in 2020.Becki EnrightBears, bison and bioersityYou don’t have to fly to southern Africa to go on safari – Romania is one of the best places in Europe to see large mammals in the wild. The country has seven million hectares of forests – a significant proportion is ancient virgin woodland – and is home to the continent’s largest populations of brown bears, as well as wolves and lynx. Among organisations working to protect the wilderness is Foundation Conservation Carpathia (FCC), which has ambitious plans to create the largest forested national park in Europe. Focusing on restoring degraded forests and the wider ecosystem, FCC recently launched an ecotourism programme, including bear tracking. It has built four wildlife hides and trains specialised guides for one- and multi-day trips. FCC is also rolling out a four-year bison reintroduction programme in the region’s Făgăraș mountains, in partnership with the ProPark Foundation for Protected Areas and Conservation Capital. The first animals will be released into the wild this spring.Besides benefiting local communities through wildlife tourism, the reintroduction of bison – which disappeared from Romania 200 years ago – will also increase bioersity. In a separate venture by Rewilding Europe and WWF Romania, the European commission-funded Life Bison project has already released 60 animals in Carpathia’s Tarcu and Poiana Ruscă mountains, with more to come this year. Bison-tracking holidays in the area are offered by the European Safari Company (part of Rewilding Europe). A two-night experience costs from €299, including guiding and meals. The Bison Hillock Association, also involved in the project, offers a choice of trips, too, with hiking, cycling and homestay options.While the country faces issues with extensive illegal logging (two rangers were killed last autumn trying to protect the forests, and protesters took to the streets in November demanding more government action), ecotourism is increasing steadily.“There are challenges but ecotourism is growing organically here and lots of small-scale ethical businesses are opening, using local guides and produce, with the money staying in the community,” said Andrei Blumer, president of the Association of Eco-Tourism in Romania.In the Danube Delta, new conservation projects include the reintroduction of water buffalo on Ermakov island. “We have amazing nature and wildlife and offer something unique in Europe,” said Blumer.Jane DunfordNative culture and natural beautyIt may not come as a surprise that a country led by a 34-year-old female prime minister and an all-female coalition is also a world leader in progressive environmental policies. Among the Finnish coalition’s key policies is a pledge to become a carbon-neutral country by 2035. Tourism is playing its part, with a rigorous sustainability policy that puts protection of the country’s natural environment first. But a commitment to protect nature – and people – runs the length and breadth of the country. In Utsjoki, the northernmost municipality, the 1,200-strong community is reinventing its tourism, after new regulations put an end to salmon fishing, once its largest source of income. Now Utsjoki is promoting its wilderness and Sami culture through mountain biking, kayaking, snow-shoeing and visiting the three villages to experience modern Sami culture, where reindeer husbandry is still a significant part of life.In the east, local company Äksyt Ämmät runs small-group tours of the forest, rivers and lakes of North Karelia. These are hosted by local guides and offer stays in small, family-run guesthouses: from a two-hour snow-shoeing tour through Koli national park (adults from €30 children €15) to a week on an island on Lake Saimaa (from €1,328pp) cross-country skiing and snow-shoeing and meeting villagers.In the autumn, Finland went a step further in its mission to create a tourism industry built on the long-term preservation of the environment, by introducing a tourism pledge, and encouraging visitors to not just enjoy nature but to “respect and treasure” it, too.Isabel ChoatMaking tourism a force for goodTourism has been a game-changer for Portugal, making Lisbon and, more recently, Porto into weekend hotspots with boutique hotels and hipster bars and restaurants. This has not been without a cost – one that’s been borne primarily by local residents and businesses, who find themselves forced out of neighbourhoods by rising rents. Acknowledging that this growth was too rapid, the government is determined that a planned increase in visitor numbers will be managed sustainably, spreading tourism across the country – and the seasons – and putting local people first.It is three years into a 10-year sustainability strategy under which millions of euros has been invested in a variety of programmes aimed at boosting tourism beyond the honeypot destinations. One such programme is Revive, designed to breathe new life into abandoned or run-down heritage sites. One of the first – of 33 – to open was Vila Galé, a former convent converted into a hotel in Elvas, a Unesco-listed but overlooked town near the Spanish border. A similar scheme, Revive Natura, will do the same for rural sites, such as former rangers’ cottages.In the southern Alentejo, the largest artificial lake in Europe, Alqueva, was once ignored even by locals but is now a destination with water sports, beach areas, boutique hotels and a dark sky reserve.Europe’s biggest gardening projectMore than 700 volunteer gardeners have been busy in Salford, removing invasive species from a 154-acre site and planting more welcome ones, including 40,000 crocus bulbs for a dazzling spring display. They are not toiling alone: a small herd of rare-breed pigs has been clearing brambles and digging over the soil. Oh, and there are quite a few professional gardeners on board, too.This is the new RHS Garden Bridgewater, the biggest gardening project in Europe. The £30m-plus site is due to open this summer on the site of Worsley New Hall, a 19th-century mansion on the edge of the city that was demolished in the 1940s. It is the RHS’s first new garden in 17 years and first urban garden, it has been designed by landscape architect Tom Stuart-Smith. A million annual visitors are expected to generate £13.8m a year for the local economy by 2029, with 140 jobs in the garden itself and 180 more in the surrounding area. Community is at the heart of this garden. Richard Green, the head of Bridgewater, says: “There is no other garden like this in the north-west of England, not on this scale. It is a mix of stunning horticulture and a place for people.”As well as the green-fingered volunteers, GPs are already referring patients to the garden through a “social prescribing” pilot scheme, whereby people struggling with isolation, mobility problems and other conditions are prescribed activities such as gardening. A dedicated therapeutic gardener, Ozichi Brewster, leads this programme, which has so far helped 40 people. Patients can plant hanging baskets, make bug hotels, go on woodland walks or join tai chi and yoga sessions in the wellbeing garden, a hub for community organisations such as dementia support groups and veterans.Young people have also been helping in the garden under the National Citizen Service. Soon there will be classrooms and a learning garden – about 7,000 local schoolchildren will be invited every year – and apprenticeship schemes. Adults can garden in community allotments in the walled garden four of the plots will be dedicated to growing produce for a local food bank. There are also demonstration areas to inspire visitors to transform their own gardens.Other prominent features include a kitchen garden, providing fruit and vegetables for the cafe a Chinese garden created with Greater Manchester’s Chinese community and a calming “paradise garden” with a huge pond. A wild woodland play area with hobbit holes, a bug garden and a low ropes course is designed to help children of all ages get outside, connect with nature and socialise away from screens.Those who can’t wait for the official opening in the summer can book a two-hour guided tour (£5, until April). Or why not join the green army? The garden is recruiting now for its next batch of volunteers.Ambitious habitat restoration projectIt’s easy to presume that the Cairngorms national park, with its ancient woodlands, peat bogs, untamed rivers and forbidding mountains, is faring well when it comes to conservation. But in fact, much of its native flora and fauna has been damaged by hundreds of years of poor management and a burgeoning deer population. One organisation is now helping turn the tide by putting together the most ambitious vision for habitat restoration Britain has ever seen.Committing to an ecological timeframe of 200 years (there’s no room for a short-term mentality here), neighbouring land managers — including Wildland, RSPB Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry and Land Scotland — will work together to restore native woodlands, peatlands, wetlands and rivers.In 2020, visitors will get a better sense of the project thanks to a newly refurbished visitor centre, interpretive walks and volunteering opportunities. Since 1959, when it was just a caravan parked on borrowed land, the Loch Garten Osprey Centre in Abernethy has grown into the RSPB’s second-largest and most erse reserve, home to more than 5,000 species. Thanks to funding from European Structural Funds, the centre will in 2020 be renamed and refurbished with improved access, and open for eight months of the year: the Loch Garten Nature Centre will help explain Cairngorms Connect as part of a wider conservation story.Beyond the centre, interpretive walks will be added to the Big Pines and Two Lochs trails to enhance understanding of the UK’s largest single remnant of ancient Caledonian pinewood.While Cairngorms Connect’s focus for 2020 is getting local communities involved, visitors will get a look-in, too. Volunteers can join one-day projects from seed collecting to planting (once live, opportunities will be advertised on the Cairngorms Connect website).Rewilding tour operator Scotland: The Big Picture has launched a four-day Wilderness Weekend: Cairngorms Connect (15-18 May, from £765pp), which takes visitors on a conservation-oriented journey through the erse landscapes.Also opening in the region next year, as part of the Cairngorms national park’s net zero by 2045 vision, is a Speyside Way extension and a Strathspey electric bike project.Holly TuppenStargazing in the Sperrin mountains, County TyroneThe Sperrin mountains, which straddle the counties of Derry and Tyrone, are often overlooked by visitors heading for the Giant’s Causeway on the Antrim coast, or various Game of Thrones locations. But the Sperrins are “Ulster’s wildest land”, according to Irish poet Mary Montague. “The thickest sheets of the last ice age scoured these mountains into smooth undulations that banner the skyline. But don’t be fooled by gentle curves – the Sperrins’ heart is vastly bleak,” she says.The Sperrins area of outstanding natural beauty is a wild, untouched landscape of moorland and forest, punctuated with tarns and bogs. It also offers rare unspoiled views of the night sky. A scatter of neolithic monuments, such as the Beaghmore stone circle, bear testament to the fact that the constellations have long held sway over these parts.In April, Northern Ireland’s first dark sky observatory will open in Davagh Forest, giving visitors the opportunity to experience the night sky away from light pollution.This dense woodland, with miles of moss-covered conifers, has a fairytale quality, with sika deer roaming free and the odd sighting of rare pine martens. It sits in a small valley formed by the Davagh Water, one of the headstreams of the Owenreagh River, and is popular with hikers and mountain bikers. But the £1.2m Dark Sky Park will focus attention upwards, with a telescope trained on the solar system through a retractable roof.A series of audio-visual shows with maps of the solar system will be specially created for night-time events and screened on to the buildings: visitors can watch from a viewing platform, and explore the universe via holographic installations and virtual reality headsets. There will also be exhibitions linking the landscape with the archaeological and astronomical heritage of the Sperrins, as well as a play planetarium for children.And for those who want to extend their stay and sleep under the stars, like the ancients, five glamping pods are being built alongside the centre (from £100 a night for four people, sperrinviewglamping).Andy PietrasikA biosphere reserve is not merely a landscape that’s been put aside for nature, but a place where communities have learned to live alongside natural habitats. The Isle of Wight has been awarded the accolade thanks to its rare wildlife — red squirrels in the woodlands, Glanville fritillaries on chalky cliffs, and the Ventnor wall lizard on sunny, beachfront walls — and sustainable economic development. Collaboration between environmental organisations, charities, councils and local volunteers is improving the island for locals, visitors and nature alike. The Common Space, a non-profit, is working with local volunteers to revitalise the Bay area in the east of the island a 2020 calendar of events includes British Science Week (6-15 March), when pop-up laboratories will showcase natural wonders from pond life to fossils.In Sandown on the south coast, Browns Golf Course is getting a wildlife makeover thanks to a new footpath linking a previously overgrown woodland walk and reedbed wetland. Via the Lost Duver Project, the council and community are also restoring former dune stacks in Sandown by replanting native coastal flora such as ragged-robin and thrift.From a commitment to green building (Tom’s Eco Lodge is powered by a solar field and biomass boiler) to supporting rewilding initiatives (Tiny Homes’ wildflower meadows), tourism is very much part of the island’s biosphere fame.Also launched in 2019, Visit Isle of Wight’s Slow Travel Guide encourages visitors to leave cars at home, with eight car-free touring routes via bus, rail, bike or footpath. The island’s sustainable travel scheme also allows accommodation owners with the highest green ratings, including Nettlecombe Farm (from £370 for four people per week) and Seaview Hotel (from £95), to offer guests free bus travel.Holly TuppenThe Recovery Olympics in JapanThe Tokyo Olympic Games of 1964 became a symbol of Japan’s economic rebirth after the second world war, when visitors were dazzled by the country’s ambition. This time around, the organisers of Tokyo 2020 are hoping the games will signal the regeneration of the Tohoku region, which was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and open up a lesser-known part of the country to visitors.The games are billed as the Recovery Olympics, and the Olympic torch - made of aluminium recycled from the temporary shelters used to house 500,000 displaced people – will begin its relay at the J-Village football stadium, just outside the 30km exclusion zone of the crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, before moving through the neighbouring prefectures of Miyagi and Iwate, also affected in 2011. The J-Village and Azuma baseball stadium in Fukushima City will host baseball, softball and football matches in the summer.Almost a decade after the disaster this is not an exercise in dark tourism – though one operator has started running Chernobyl-style tours of the Fukushima exclusion zone. Rather, it is an opportunity to discover a more authentic side of Japan – away from the tourist-thronged shrines and temples of Kyoto.The bullet train delivers passengers from Tokyo at warp speed – actually 90 minutes, though it feels like travelling back in time from the frenzy of the 21st-century capital – to what Richard Lloyd Parry describes in his book Ghosts of the Tsunami as a “slower, gentler” arcadia of mountains, lakes, rivers and “fields rich in grain and fruit”. (Tohoku is famous for its high-quality rice, peaches, grapes, Kitakata ramen and sake – though producers have struggled to overcome fears about contaminated food, despite it being exported once more.)Aizu, in the west of Fukushima, is steeped in the history of the samurai, the hard men of the north, but it is also famous for its delicately detailed lacquerware dating back to the 16th century and flourishing in the Edo era (17th-19th centuries). Onsen villages, such as Tsuchiyu, have sprouted around hot springs in the mountains, and to the north, often wreathed in wisps of low-lying cloud like a Hokusai print, lies magnificent Mount Bandai.This conical volcano in the Bandai-Asahi national park is surrounded by lakes, including the vividly cobalt pools of Goshiki-numa. When Olympian Tom Daley visited the region last summer, he stayed at the charming Bandai Lake Guesthouse and performed frontflips and backflips on the jetty by Lake Sohara. The ultimate irony is that this Lake District of Japan was formed by another natural disaster – when Mount Bandai blew its top in 1888.Andy PietrasikCreating a vast nature reserve Tens of millions of bison once thrived on the great plains of north America but by the late 1800s they had almost disappeared. Now the near-threatened species is grazing once again. Some 20,000 now live in America, mostly in small, often fenced-in, herds. But on the high plains of north-east Montana more than 800 beasts roam free. The conservation of this herd (or obstinacy) is just one of many wildlife projects run by American Prairie Reserve (APR), a non-profit that aims to preserve vast tracts of wilderness.Using a similar model to the Tompkins Foundation in Chilean Patagonia, the APR makes strategic purchases of private land that it uses to stitch together tracts of existing public land. Since it started in 2004, APR has bought over 100,000 acres, which has been joined with public land to form 419,000 acres of rolling hills and grassy plateaux drained by the Missouri River. The goal is to form a prairie area of roughly 3.2 million acres, complete with migration corridors – the largest nature reserve in the continental US.The APR’s activities have upset local ranchers and farmers. But founder Sean Gerrity, who made his fortune in Silicon Valley, is determined to create a vast ecosystem where wildlife large and small can roam free.As well as bison, it runs projects to protect habitats and increase populations of at-risk animals, including prairie dogs, cougars, pronghorns (endemic deer) and grassland birds. With no fences, the freedom-to-roam philosophy applies to visitors, too. It’s possible to walk, cycle or canoe for miles and see nothing manmade, except the odd signpost. Small-scale accommodation options include two campsites (from $15) with RV hookups a safari-style lodge and two pairs of large yurts – Founders Hut and John and Margaret Craighead Hut – each connected by a hallway and accommodating nine people in four bunk rooms. A third “hut” is due to open this year.Under big Montana skies, visitors can wake up to scenery that has barely changed in centuries, and that will be protected for generations to come. Isabel ChoatBirthplace of Greenpeace grows greenerVancouver calls itself a 20-minute city: it takes 20 minutes to get to the beach, the mountains and the airport. But green space is not in short supply either. Downtown Stanley Park is bigger than Central Park in New York, and is surrounded by water on three sides. Visitors can cycle around it along part of the Seawall, a 28km path around the city’s waterfront. Nearby Vanier Park is a summer hotspot, with its Bard on the Beach Shakespeare festival and big attractions such as the Museum of Vancouver. A little further out, the Pacific Spirit regional park has a network of hiking routes in 1,850 acres of forest, while North Shore is the place to head for legendary mountain biking trails.Now, Vancouver’s Greenest City Action Plan aims to drastically reduce carbon emissions, with 122,000 new trees planted since 2010. It is a fitting initiative for the birthplace of Greenpeace (the environmental group was founded here in 1971) and Vancouver continues to raise the bar: last month, the world’s first fully electric commercial aircraft took off from here, raising hopes of a new, guilt-free “electric aviation age”.The 100-mile diet – eating only food grown within 100 miles of your home –originated in Vancouver in 2005. Restaurants that have embraced this include Forage, whose executive chef hunts, fishes and keeps bees Chambar, which has been carbon-neutral since 2011 the Acorn, an award-winning “vegetable-forward” restaurant and Edible Canada, which promotes sustainable, seasonal food and stocks an enormous range of Canadian produce for diners to take home.The central Listel hotel (doubles from £90), has a five-Green Key eco-rating and is full of original work by Canadian artists.Rachel DixonSustainable recovery after terror attackIn the past 10 years, Sri Lanka has flourished as a tourist destination. Opening up to visitors since the end of the civil war has meant a growth in accommodation, from tea plantation bungalows and surfer hostels to mountain-view hotels and treehouses among the lush lowland rainforests. The number of tour companies has also increased, with more of them travelling to remote, lesser-visited regions such as the national parks of Gal Oya and Wilpattu, and the coastal areas of Kalpitiya and Kalkudah, benefiting smaller businesses including tuk-tuk drivers, souvenir sellers and family-run restaurants.As the country looks ahead, there are projects to be celebrated. The Sri Lanka Ecotourism Foundation, running since 1998, supports social and economic development of rural communities. Its work ranges from renewable energy projects, such as small-scale wind-solar farm training programmes, to empowering women through ecotourism roles, including a new lagoon-side campsite and activity centre, the Hikkaduwa Women-Centric Ecotourism Project. It also launched a new national sustainable tourism certification for hotels in April 2019.Beyond this, there are compelling sustainability and community-based tourism projects all over the country. Mangrove replanting has been taking place since the 2004 tsunami – including at Kitesurfing Lanka in Kalpitiya. Mangroves are not only an effective defence against the sea, but also help boost wildlife and act as long-term carbon sinks.Waste Less Arugam Bay is a partnership aiming to educate tourists and local communities about plastic – through, for example, reliable waste collection, creating souvenirs from recycled plastic, and providing water bottle refills. Fairtrade homeware and clothing brand Selyn uses a female-led workforce, traditional techniques and maintains a cottage industry via regional producers, which welcome visitors.Joining local families in the lesser-travelled inland part of Tangalle in the south, Experience Travel runs tours to support rural crafts and practices, such as producers of handcrafted buffalo curd, served as a delicious sweet dessert in clay pots called mee-kiri, topped with sticky kithul palm syrup.Antonia WilsonCommunity tourism begins on new Route of ParksFew countries on Earth have allocated more land for environmental protection in recent years than Chile, which in 2018 set aside 10 million acres of Patagonia to be preserved in five national parks. This was due in no small part to the conservation work of American philanthropist Kristine McDivitt Tompkins (ex-CEO of outdoors company Patagonia) and her late husband Doug (co-founder of North Face), who donated a large chunk of the land. In 2020, it will be easier than ever to visit these remote reserves, thanks to the new Route of Parks. Launched last year, the route consolidates a haphazard tourist circuit ning 1,700 miles (and 17 national parks), from the volcano-dotted forests of Chile’s Lake District to the fjords at the southern tip of the continent.Locals in the 60 communities along the route have responded to the Tompkins’ vision by taking ownership of the wilderness and starting tourism projects that will help protect the parks in the long term (as well as create sustainable incomes). Chaitén-based Ruta Patagonia 7 runs tours along the famed Carretera Austral (Southern Highway) to the newly designated Pumalín national park, a rainforest reserve in remote northern Patagonia. Further south, Patagonian Fjords has opened up the previously inaccessible – and newly created – Kawésqar national park to tourism for the first time, with trips through its fog-draped fjords departing from the resort town of Puerto Natales.New hotels have also popped up along the route, including Estancia Caleta Josefina (rooms from £135), on a sheep farm in Tierra del Fuego. And in 2018 Patagonia national park (home to one of the most ambitious rewilding efforts in the Americas) opened a new museum, Patagonia Park Museum, which explores local history and the current extinction crisis. Another museum dedicated to the Anglo-Argentine pioneer Lucas Bridges (author of Uttermost Part of the Earth, the 1947 landmark book on Tierra del Fuego) will open here in 2020.Connectivity, long a barrier to regional development, has improved alongside the new route. There is no land connection between the northern and southern sections of Chilean Patagonia, but a ferry service now links the end of the Carretera Austral with Puerto Natales, making it easier for tourists to travel along a unified path without detouring into Argentina. A road under construction in a remote stretch of Tierra del Fuego will finally open up little-visited Yendegaia national park, which protects the ice fields of the Cordillera Darwin mountain range.Mark Johanson This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

With this strategy, even a couple dozen attendees counts as a success.On her arrival in Rockwell – with temperatures below freezing – 25 people including Hiller had piled aboard the big green Amy bus for hot chocolate. Two dozen others had turned out to see the Minnesota senator in tiny Ida Grove that same day, a county that doesn’t even have 1,000 registered Democrats. But most striking to Klobuchar was a crowd of around 50 packing the Sac County Cattle Company on a Sunday night just before Christmas. It’s where the Republican congressman Steve King, who hails from Kiron, 30 miles south, stumps and dines with family. The proprietor said Klobuchar’s crowds were at least the size of King’s, or any other Republican who has come calling.“We’re approaching this like we can win, and all signs are pointing in the right direction,” Klobuchar told the . “A crowd that size in Sac City, anywhere in rural America, means something. I’m especially glad it’s in Steve King’s backyard.”Klobuchar is blunt about her shared background with Iowa’s voters. She brags about being from the midwest, and how she can win in rural Minnesota counties that Trump took by 20 points. In the last Democratic debate she took a dig at the location of a rival’s fundraiser by saying she’s never been to a wine cave, but she’s been to a wind cave in South Dakota. A mention of Trump is usually followed with a mention of the tanking of corn and soybean prices from trade wars. Her entire argument is built around electability in midwest swing states such as Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan and Ohio.“He’s treating farmers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos,” she said to the delight of her audience at one stop. By contrast, she says she remembers her neighbors saving spare cash in coffee cans growing up.The question is whether her momentum, which is mainly confined to Iowa, is too little too late. In less than six weeks, caucusgoers will trudge through a frigid night to precinct meetings in schoolhouses and courthouses – while she may be chained to Trump’s impeachment trial in the US Senate, which is set to start sometime in January and last for an unknown time.“To say it’s an uphill battle would definitely be accurate, even charitable,” said Brad Best, a longtime caucus observer and political science professor at Buena Vista University in Storm Lake. “In an ironic way, her stardom in the Senate will hurt her campaigning in Iowa, where she desperately needs to do well.”Yet, there are precedents. John Kerry came from the shadows in 2004 less than two weeks before the caucuses to win, and later secure the nomination. Klobuchar says a doubling of office spaces in Iowa and positive responses in Des Moines RegisterCNN Iowa polls are signs of hope. Best says her strongest advantage is that overwhelming majorities of probable caucusgoers have favorable opinions of her and list her in their top three selections.“I’d say I know Iowans pretty well, and they really like honesty, which is what we aren’t seeing from the man in the White House,” Klobuchar said, citing the 39 counties in Iowa that voted for Trump in 2016 and Barack Obama in 2008.She says people there have a thirst for economic prosperity that can be achieved realistically, not with promises like Medicare for All. She never mentions challengers from the progressive wing by name. “We can win them back telling the truth. We can bring those people back.”Congressional candidate JD Scholten, a Sioux City Democrat running against King, likes Klobuchar’s strategy of dwelling on rural voters. He just capped off a 39-county bus tour of western Iowa in a camper.Scholten said voters in rural areas like Sac City and Rockwell City are easier to organize than in Democratic metro strongholds such as Des Moines or Iowa City. Those who show up in Rockwell City are reliably Democratic and less issue-focused. Rarely do they see a candidate with Klobuchar’s resume. When they do, they leave with a strong impression.“It’s a lot easier to get viability in Sac county than Polk county,” said Scholten. “She recognizes that people are familiar with her. Sac City isn’t a long way from the Iowa-Minnesota border.”Those who hear Klobuchar’s message like her focus on the midwest. After the Sac City event, one farmer – who declined to offer his name because his landlord is Republican – said Klobuchar’s retelling of family stories from the iron ore mines and farms of northern Minnesota struck him as authentic.“It’s not a story she picked up from somewhere. It’s one you can tell she’s from here, she’s one of us who faces the same problems we do,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c135649f4c5df465c02b96c7dcacd2decf16498/0_7_4128_2477/master/4128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6ded7bd42ec1d9ec22a676942ae41a0","title":"us political assassinations history iran suleimani","story":"There has been no shortage of US attempts to remove foreign adversaries through highly dubious legal or ethical means The US government is no stranger to the dark arts of political assassinations. Over the decades it has deployed elaborate techniques against its foes, from dispatching a chemist armed with lethal poison to try to take out Congo’s Patrice Lumumba in the 1960s to planting poison pills (equally unsuccessfully) in the Cuban leader Fidel Castro’s food.But the killing of General Qassem Suleimani, the leader of Iran’s elite military Quds Force, was in in a class all its own. Its uniqueness lay not so much in its method – what difference does it make to the victim if they are eviscerated by aerial drone like Suleimani, or executed following a CIA-backed coup, as was Iraq’s ruler in 1963, Abdul Karim Kassem? – but in the brazenness of its execution and the apparently total disregard for either legal niceties or human consequences.“The US simply isn’t in the practice of assassinating senior state officials out in the open like this,” said Charles Lister, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. “While Suleimani was a brutal figure responsible for a great deal of suffering, and his Quds Force was designated by the US as a terrorist organization, there’s no escaping that he was arguably the second most powerful man in Iran behind the supreme leader.”Donald Trump’s gloating tweets over the killing combined with a sparse effort to justify the action in either domestic or international law has led to the US being accused of the very crimes it normally pins on its enemies. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, denounced the assassination as an “act of international terrorism”.Vipin Narang, a political scientist at MIT, said the killing “wasn’t deterrence, it was decapitation”.There has been no shortage of US interventions over the past half century that have attempted – and in some cases succeeded – in removing foreign adversaries through highly dubious legal or ethical means. The country has admitted to making no fewer than eight assassination attempts on Castro, though the real figure was probably much higher.William Blum, the author of Killing Hope: US Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II, points to a litany of American sins from invasions, bombings, overthrowing of governments, assassinations to torture and death squads. “It’s not a pretty picture,” is his blunt conclusion.The CIA was deemed to have run so amok in the 1960s and 70s that in 1975 the Church committee investigated a numerous attempted assassinations on foreign leaders including Lumumba, Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, Vietnam’s Ngo Dinh Diem, and of course Castro. In the fallout, President Ford banned US involvement in foreign political assassinations.The ban didn’t last long. Since 1976 the US has continued to be engaged in, or accused of, efforts to eradicate foreign leaders.Ronald Reagan launched bombing raids in 1986 targeting Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi. As recently as two years ago North Korea alleged that the CIA tried to assassinate its leader Kim Jong-un.But most of the interventions in the modern era have been covert and conducted beneath the radar. Where they have been proclaimed publicly, they have tended to target non-state actors operating in militias or militant groups like Islamic State.Presidents Obama and Trump both claimed huge public relations victories when they oversaw the killings of Osama bin Laden and the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi respectively.By contrast, until Trump the US has tended to fight shy of conducting overt assassination attempts on state actors connected to sovereign regimes. Suleimani himself is a case in point.In 2008, the CIA worked hand in glove with the Israeli intelligence service the Mossad to target Imad Mughniyah, a senior Hezbollah leader, for assassination. In the course of their efforts they had the chance of taking out not only Mughniyah but also Suleimani in a single drone strike. In the end, the operation was called off because the US government blocked it on grounds that it could seriously have destabilised the region.Despite such reticence, Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor of international law at the University of Notre Dame, draws a direct line between earlier US administrations and the convention-shredding unpredictability of Trump. She said the advent of the unmanned drone in 2000 put the US on a slippery slope towards the current crisis.The first deployment of a drone as an assassination tool was ordered by Bill Clinton in an effort to get Bin Laden. The first successful “targeted killing”, as it is now called, came soon after, carried out by the Bush administration in Yemen.Obama inherited Bush’s widespread use of drone killings and increased their frequency tenfold, while seeking to give them a veneer of legal respectability with the secret internal “targeted killing memos”. Those documents argued that drone assassinations were justified under international law as self-defense against future terrorist attacks – a rationale that has been widely disputed as a misreading of the UN charter.“Since Obama there has been a steady dilution of international law,” O’Connell said. “Suleimani’s death marks the next dilution – we are moving down a slope towards a completely lawless situation.”O’Connell added that there was only one step left for the US now to take. “To completely ignore the law. Frankly, I think President Trump is there already – his only argument has been that Suleimani was a bad guy and so he had to be killed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be75dcdd7a1d5f554cd53da6f6fc7f540b27e77/0_220_5226_3134/master/5226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb88282c186b2ee23b58362bc0b6d5e","title":"us citizens in iraq tell us about your situation","story":"We’d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country. Share your stories The American Embassy in Baghdad is calling for all US citizens in Iraq to leave the country as soon as possible.In the early hours of 3 January, Iran’s most powerful general Qassem Suleimani was killed outside Baghdad airport in an airstrike sanctioned by the US President, Donald Trump. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, de-facto leader of the Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), and close associate of Suleimani, also died in the attack.The killing represents a significant acceleration in the escalation of tensions between the US and Iran. It followed just hours after the conclusion of a two-day siege against the US embassy in Baghdad by PMU militants, which was prompted by a US airstrike camps belonging to a PMU-affiliated militia, itself a response to that group’s killing of a US contractor at an Iraqi army base.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has sworn revenge for Suleimani’s death.The embassy said in a statement that it “urges American Citizens to heed the January 2020 Travel Advisory and depart Iraq immediately. US citizens should depart via airline while possible, and failing that, to other countries by land.”“Due to Iranian-backed militia attacks at the US Embassy compound, all public consular operations are suspended until further notice”, the statement added.We would like to hear from you if you are a US citizen in Iraq, or if you know someone who has been affected by the order to evacuate.Though we’d like to hear from you, your security is most important.

Now, they are questioning when the president’s actions might kill them.Among the massive Persian community in southern California, which is home to the largest Iranian population outside of Iran, residents said the news of a US airstrike killing Iran’s most powerful general had caused them to experience panic and dread, flashbacks to childhood memories of war, and concerns that they may never see some of their friends and relatives again.“The anxiety and fear is palpable,” said Niaz Kasravi, a Los Angeles-based advocate who came to the US from Iran in 1984 when she was nine. “Some of our generations have been through this so many times … Is this the start of a third world war?”In the hours since Trump ordered the airstrike that killed the general Qassem Suleimani, Tehran has vowed to avenge the death, and pundits have predicted a new era of conflict in the Middle East. Meanwhile in LA, members of the city’s vibrant and erse Iranian American communities said they were still trying to process the news and grapple with potential ramifications.“It’s unsettling, because it’s one of those things where you cannot predict what happens,” said Shahin Motallebi, 58, as he was leaving Shaherzad, a Persian restaurant in the center of LA’s Little Persia, an enclave also known as Tehrangeles. “Everyone has family in Iran. Everyone is worried.”On Friday afternoon, the Tehrangeles commercial hub on Westwood boulevard was bustling as usual. Families packed in the popular Attari sandwich shop eating kabobs, crowds gathered inside a Persian pizza shop and Persian ice cream store, and people shopped at the local grocery stores and bookshops. The community grew in the 1960s and boomed after the 1979 revolution, with an estimated 500,000 people of Iranian descent now living in southern California.Motallebi, an attorney who works in the neighborhood and came to the US in 1989 at age 29, said it was hard to trust the president: “He acts first and thinks about it later. I don’t think it’s well thought out.”Standing on the corner across the street, Ali Asghari, 41, said it was clear to him that Iranian Americans were deeply ided: “Even among very like-minded Iranians, there are so many different opinions.”Some are desperate to see a regime change and aren’t thinking about the consequences or what might come next, said Asghari, a software product manager who has been in LA for 19 years. Others are very skeptical of Trump’s decisions, he said: “I don’t know what is right or wrong, but I know people are suffering … People are so scared. It’s very emotional.”For some, the Trump administration has caused severe devastation with his travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, unveiled in January 2017, a week after his inauguration. The reality of the ongoing and severe travel restrictions has made news of the airstrike all the more terrifying, said Paris Etemadi Scott, the legal director at Pars Equality, a group that provides services to Iranian Americans in California.“It is an impossible situation,” she said, noting that some are panicked about how the escalating conflict could impact their families’ pending immigration battles. With parents, siblings, spouses and others in Iran barred from traveling to the US, some are afraid the president is ignoring the exacerbated hardships that could arise, she said: “The community is worried about this administration forgetting that there is a travel ban in place … A lot of people are glued to the TV and social media.”Assal Rad, a research fellow with the National Iranian American Council, who is based in Orange county, said there were a lot of ergent political beliefs in the community, but that many were united in their fears of war and death.“For people who remember the lead up to the Iraq war and feeling helpless, we’re having that same moment again. It’s like that PTSD, a flashback to, here we go again.”Many Iranian Americans have grown accustomed to the tensions of their “dual identity”, hearing constant attacks from both governments, and living with fear, she said: “This feels very different. This is what we were scared of. The fear is coming to fruition.”“What people are worried about is not some battle between two states. What they are concerned about is the human cost,” she added.There are also fears of increased harassment, discrimination and violence against Iranian Americans as tensions rise, said Kasravi, who is the director of the Avalan Institute, a research group. While US law enforcement officials, including the LA police department, have vowed to step up security measures, that’s not always comforting, given histories of unjust policing, she said: “I want my community to be safer, but I don’t want that safety to depend on a system that I know is not particularly effective or fair for all communities.”Kasravi said the Thursday night news had also transported her to childhood memories: “I’m thinking about growing up during revolution and war … about the fear of that little girl woken up by sirens in the middle of the night.”Pouya Alimagham, a lecturer and historian who was at home with his parents in Orange county when the news broke, noted that it was unnerving to watch US media programs feature rightwing thinktank heads and retired military personnel while largely excluding Iranian perspectives.“We’ve been on a rollercoaster ride for months,” he added. “We’ve been talking about escalation for the past six months, and how this is going to lead to war … the war has already begun.”Some in the community had a different perspective. Standing outside one of the Persian restaurants on Westwood boulevard, Abe Oheb, 77, was playing Trump’s speech out loud on his phone.“I’m happy this happened, because the guy who was killed did a lot of atrocities …. It was a nice decision by the United States,” said Oheb, who came to the US from Iran 40 years ago. “Yes I’m Iranian … but I am American.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fd4cc37e78c08444f434fee67456e1b16156bf6/0_243_4051_2431/master/4051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5312ce7a6b5383a569c66df43690cf4","title":"life for retired opera singers in the house that verdi built","story":"Old and young alike are now benefiting from the composer’s home for retired musiciansRenato Franco Perversi and Irena Domowicz are squabbling over who does the better rendition of the Neapolitan classic, O Sole Mio. Perversi, 87, sings deep, while Domowicz, who says you must never ask a woman her age, immediately replicates the kind of performance she might have given during her career as a mezzo-soprano.“There is more theatre in here sometimes than in the outside world,” she joked.Hardly surprising. The pair are among the 60 retired opera stars playing out their days in an elegant mansion in Milan founded by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. Verdi, famous for compositions including La Traviata, Aida and Otello, was in his 80s when he conceived the idea of a refuge for musicians who, he said, “are not favoured by fortune, or who, when they were young, did not possess the virtue of saving”.He did not want to be thanked for his generosity, and so stipulated that the home be opened after his death. The composer died in 1901, and the first nine guests moved into Casa Verdi a year later. For the next few decades, royalties from Verdi’s 27 works paid for the residents’ keep, including medical costs, and the building’s maintenance.Today most of the costs are covered by investments made by the Giuseppe Verdi Foundation, with residents paying according to their means.“The motives for which Giuseppe Verdi chose to build this house are still valid,” said Roberto Ruozi, president of the Giuseppe Verdi Foundation. “In the sense that there are numerous personalities who have dedicated their lives to music, who need to enter into a retirement home as they no longer have the economic means to sustain themselves, or who have complicated family lives.”Over the last 117 years, Casa Verdi has hosted 1,500 guests from across the musical spectrum, some of them famous, others less so. Perversi played the violin at La Scala for 10 years, while Domowicz toured with philharmonic orchestras across the globe. Another resident is 94-year-old Bissy Roman, a musicologist who was teaching well into her 70s.“Music is my life and I am very lucky to be here with other musicians,” said Roman.Casa Verdi is not so much of a “rest home” in the traditional sense. The sound of music is everywhere. On the morning the  visited, guests were wrapping up a singing session around the piano. Instruments fill the rooms, including a wooden spinet gifted to Verdi to practise on as a child, while concerts are a regular occurrence.The home is also a museum to Verdi, containing items of his clothing, letters and paintings he commissioned from poor artists. The composer is nearby, having been laid to rest in Casa Verdi’s courtyard alongside his wife, the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theWhen the sculptor and politician, Giulio Monteverde, wrote in a letter to Verdi: “Tell me the truth. What is your favourite work?”, the maestro replied: “The home I built in Milan for retired musicians.”The only big alteration to Casa Verdi came in 1999, when it was opened up to 20 music students, an initiative aimed at assisting young people as well as bringing the generations together. The two groups mix and the older musicians give the young people invaluable guidance.“For the elderly people, the youngsters are injections of life and vice-versa, for the young people, the elderly are their teachers,” said Ruozi.Roman said that one of the best things about living in Casa Verdi was the students. Among her favourites is Corrado Neri, a 25-year-old singer and composer from Sicily.“When I first came to Milan I really struggled to find a place to stay and study,” said Neri, who through Roman’s connections has been collaborating with a music company in New York. “I had applied to Casa Verdi and two years later they called to say there was a place. It was the best thing that could have happened to me.

Union sources said 800 staff had been put on desk-sharing arrangements known as “hot desking”, with hundreds more to be placed on the system in the new year.Letters to management in the Central Bank from trade union Unite, seen by The , warn of “damage to productivity” and a “huge amount of frustration” among staff, with unions claiming the bank is in breach of agreements on desk-sharing signed when the Central Bank moved from its old headquarters on Dame Street in the city centre.One letter sent in July of 2019 outlines a range of measures Unite wants management to take, including “that isional and senior management vacate all personal offices, as a show of solidarity with colleagues across the bank, enabling such offices to be used more productively by staff”. It also suggested the bank formally move to a policy allowing staff to work two days per week from home, and that staff be allowed to choose to perform normal duties at weekends if they so wish. The bank rejected these suggestions, later correspondence reveals. Working patternsThere are currently 1,500 desks in the Central Bank, but unions estimate staff numbers are as high as 1,800 with a further several hundred contractors also operating in the building. The bank has argued that working patterns mean these workers will never be in the office all at the same time, and therefore has introduced a system whereby there are 100 desks for every 120 workers. This system is operated by managers who assign desks on a day-by-day basis within the same general area. A spokeswoman for the bank said “We acknowledge that it takes a little getting used to this new way of working. But we are very confident in the adaptability of our staff to operate the new arrangement effectively.” However, the changes have caused deep disquiet among some staff, who have asked their union to step in. “The implementation of hot desking has already led to a large amount of concern expressed to us by staff, who are experiencing damage to productivity and difficulty in collaborating with team members, as well as a huge amount of frustration in engaging with the whole process.”‘Flexibility’ conceptThe matter was referred to the Workplace Relations Commission, with unsuccessful talks held at the end of November. Further talks at the WRC are scheduled for later in January. However, unions believe the situation will be made worse with several hundred more staff set to be asked to take part in hot desking. Stances from the union and the bank in relation to the stand-off are expected to harden, with a bank spokeswoman saying the allocation of workspace is “not a matter of collective agreement between the Central Bank and trade unions”. The spokeswoman said “flexibility” was built into the design for the headquarters at North Wall Quay, which delivers “a modern, progressive and efficient workspace for our staff”. The Central Bank is currently developing a new office in the new Dublin Landings area, immediately to the north of its new headquarters. It will accommodate staff who work in its Spencer Dock office, which is up for sale. The same working practices will then come into place in these offices, the bank said. “This consolidates all our city centre accommodation into one connected campus and the same progressive design principles used in North Wall Quay will be replicated in the Dublin Landings premises.” "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Forecasters say conditions are deteriorating rapidly as death toll reaches 23Beijing replaced Wang in sign of dissatisfaction with Liaison Office\u0026rsquos handling of crisisHead of Iran\u0026rsquos Quds force killed in air strike in Baghdadi airportEscalating bush fire disaster set to intensify pressure on prime minister Scott MorrisonMother reveals son\u0026rsquos near-death ordeal as camping trip derailed by Australian blazeAir force deployed as death toll reaches 43 following deadly floods in Indonesian capitalQueues form at petrol stations and supermarkets, with conditions set to deteriorateFive of 13 on board survive as authorities investigate cause of incident near TaipeiLandslides and flash floods cause chaos in Indonesia\u0026rsquos capital following heavy rainAs \u0026lsquorural surplus labour\u0026rsquo, Uighurs and Kazakhs are relocated and forced into factories\u0026lsquoOur biggest mistake was education, in particular ideological and political education\u0026rsquoKim Jong-un to reveal new \u0026lsquostrategic weapon\u0026rsquo amid frustration over stalled US talksLargely peaceful anti-government protest turns chaotic as petrol bombs thrownThousands forced to flee to beaches as columns of fire and smoke blacken entire townsBlazes destroy more than 4m hectares, with new blazes sparked into life almost daily\u0026lsquoI have not fled justice -

But to the occupant of a two bedroom mews house in London it has become nothing less than  a daily headache.The owner of the bright pink house in Notting Hill has grown increasingly tired of the crowds of visitors gathering outside, there to see for themselves the front door outside of which the character of Mark, played by Andrew Lincoln, held up a series of handwritten signs declaring his love to Keira Knightley’s Juliet.So famous has the scene become that it was even copied in candidates’ adverts for last month’s general election, first by Labour’s Dr Rosena Allin-Khan and then the eventual Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Now the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has urged people to stay away from the cobbled mews, reminding them the property is not a film set, but a private family home.Such is the fame of the house that it has its own location pin on Instagram, with hundreds of visitors posting pictures of themselves in front of it.\u0026#34Love Actually\u0026#34 Production Photo Juliet (Keira Knightley) opens the door to a hopeful crush (Andrew Lincoln as Mark) in Richard Curtis\u0026#39 ensemble romantic comedySome of the unwanted day trippers are taking part in organised tours to the area, while a number of couples have even had their wedding photographs taken outside the house in St Lukes Mews.A council spokesman said they have been forced to step in to “help protect the resident\u0027s privacy”.The council has urged film fans to find other locations in the borough to visit, such as the famous Portobello Road market, used in the 2014 Paddington movie and its 2017 sequel, or Kensington Gardens, where the fight scene between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant in the second Bridget Jones\u0027s Diary film, The Edge of Reason, was filmed.An Instagram post taken at the house form Love Actually Public records say the house was last sold for £1.04m in 2007 - although it is currently estimated to be worth £2 million - and its owner is understood to be a partner at a London law firm specialising in tax advice for high worth iniduals.The woman, who told the council she did not want to be named, said: I had no idea this house was in the film when I bought it before the Instagram craze and now I am living under a blanket of selfies, tour guides and a queue of tourists lining up to take photos on weekends. They even walk into my house if the door is open thinking it\u0027s some sort of theme park.In an attempt to create something positive out of the situation she has now placed a donation box outside to collect money for homeless charities in the area.She added: Trying to make a good thing out of this intrusive situation I am asking that people respect the fact that not everyone has a home over their head and donate to homeless charities, either themselves or through the little pink box outside.I have helped several people into shelters and all proceeds go to local good causes. Those who make money out of bringing tours round to the mews, sometimes in a blacked out minibus, for their own personal gain should think twice.An Instagram post taken at the house form Love ActuallyIn the scene from the film - loved by some, deemed irredeemably creepy by others - Mark knocks on the door and asks newlywed Juliet to tell her husband, who happens to be his best friend, that he is a group of carol singers.He then plays a recording of carollers as he silently declares his love by holding up a series of panel cards.An RBKC spokesperson said: We want to help to protect our residents\u0027 privacy. Our borough is home to so many famous scenes from well-loved film and television. There\u0027s loads to see, so we\u0027re encouraging visitors to give the owners of the \u0027Love Actually house\u0027 a break and try out Portobello Road or one of our beautiful parks instead.Comment: A Brexit deal, Labour in a mess and Trump in peril: what 2020 holds in storeIranian general Qassim Soleimani\u0026#39s body paraded through Baghdad as supporters chant \u0026#39death to America\u0026#39Sir Rod Stewart \u0026#39charged with battery after allegedly punching security guard at children\u0026#39s party\u0026#392020 in theatre: the best plays and musicals to book tickets for nowComment: The Tories privatised rail, now they need to fix itWhy 2020 will be the year the royal brothers bury the hatchetPaltry fly-tipping fines of under £50 are failing to deter criminals from dumping wasteBBC children\u0026#39s presenter reveals staff were handed trays of shots behind the scenes Comment: Britain must seize this chance to pioneer effective land managementQueen\u0026#39s new portrait celebrates start of new decade‘Treacherous criminal aggression’: How the world reacted to Qassim Soleimani\u0026#39s killingAustralia fires: Two dead as country braces for worst day of bushfire crisisPaltry fines of as little as £50 for fly-tipping fail to deter criminals, warn councilsPatients less likely to book a GP appointment if the sun is shining - or England is playing Donald Trump ate meatloaf and ice cream as Qassim Soleimani was neutralisedScottish Tory MSP Michelle Ballantyne to stand for party leadership to ensure contest, not coronationDonald Trump says killing of Qassim Soleimani was to \u0026#39stop a war\u0026#39 with Iran Government distances itself from Dominic Cummings\u0026#39 job advert as MPs accuse him of \u0026#39subverting due process\u0026#39Comment: Mr Trump was right to take on Iran – it has given him power over the situationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/03/TELEMMGLPICT000220269904_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"qassim soleimani possible targets irans crushing revenge assassination","story":"Iranians burn a US flag during a demonstration against the assassination in TehranTehran will not leave the killing of its top commanders unanswered, and yesterday vowed crushing revenge over the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani.  The raid dramatically escalated already tense relations between the US and Iran, who have for months been fighting a shadow war.The US is now bracing for a response, though it is unclear yet what form it will take.Iran showed in September with an attack on Saudi Arabia’s biggest oil field that is is capable of sophisticated and long-range attacks from its soil, if US intelligence is to be believed.

No doubt your imagination is filled with a fantasy out of Kevin McCloud\u0027s Grand Designs: all efficient insulation and recycled materials, wooden walls and a green roof.That vision in your mind is the opposite of our house. For one, it is not green but literally yellow: a bizarre choice made by a previous owner whose unusual decisions extend through the rest of the house too, but one fitting for a place that is far from the fresh, clean image that comes with sustainable housing.We hope to repaint the house this year. And we hope to make it a little more green throughout, too: my\u0026nbsppledge for 2020 is to find the ways that our somewhat behind-the-times building can be pulled into the 21st century\u0026nbspand do its bit to avoid any further damage to the environment.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMy partner and I lack both the means and the ability to undertake any grand plans like the installation of solar panels on the roof or gutting the walls. Instead, I will be looking for the easy wins that we can do ourselves or with minimal cost and input from the outside.We already try to achieve little gains in this respect – for example, I am a dogmatic avoider of leaving the big light on. But there is undoubtedly\u0026nbspmore we can do, both in terms of the house itself and the way we live in it.I\u0027m looking forward to exploring more environmentally friendly ways of dealing with waste, of considering the appliances in our house and the way we use them, of looking into the energy our house uses and how it can be minimised. I\u0027m hopeful too that we can do that without taking ourselves off the grid or avoiding the 21st century, not least because my job as technology editor means using the latest kit.Hopefully, what we will learn will not only help educate us and you the reader about how we can all make improvements, but also help show companies how they can better enable their customers to do so.There are plenty of people, like me, living in old and often rented accommodation where they have limited scope to make improvements. Those people are of course concerned about living without damaging the Earth, too, and so I hope to find ways we can all make our homes a little more sustainable together.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to start asking what the sporting world can do to prevent global warmingIn 2020 The Independent will be doing more than ever before to try and make the world a better place. When it comes to sport, that’s easier said than done.Sport is our escape, a way to block out the realities of everyday life for 90 minutes, or a few hours, maybe even an entire day. It is supposed to be enjoyed even in defeat, and yet not even sport is exempt from the greatest threat to humankind today: global warming and the negative impact of climate change.But not even sport can continue to ignore the perils that will come to threaten its very existence unless something is done to change the path it is on. After all, how will our children and grandchildren play football, rugby or cricket if there are no parks left, or will the next Lewis Hamilton be uncovered if we can’t find a sustainable way to maintain motorsport without the use of oil, petrol and even electricity?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis year we will be delving into how sport affects the surrounding environment, exposing the shocking truths of how it is damaging the world as we know it and highlighting the ways people are trying to bring change for the better.Why will we be doing this? Whether your outlook on global warming is akin to Greta Thunberg or Donald Trump, the truth is that sport has one of the biggest impacts on climate change. Whether it’s the Arsenal squad using a private jet to fly to Norwich, or single-use plastic being used at just about every stadium across the globe, there are endless examples of ignorance when it comes to helping the environment.There will be positives, too. What is Formula E doing to inspire change not just in motorsport but in our everyday commute? What inspired Forest Green Rovers to become the world’s first 100 per cent vegan football club? And are extreme adrenaline sports the answer – they tend to go hand in hand with being at one with the world around us in an effort not to damage it.And if we are to cover all areas of this subject, we will have to take a close look at ourselves too: the media. Is it right that journalists travel all year round aboard the most environmentally damaging transport available in automotive vehicles and aeroplanes, throwing away countless notebooks instead of recycling? If we are to ask the difficult questions, we have to be prepared to answer them too.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also said its gauge of Brexit uncertainty in its monthly Decision Makers’ Panel survey fell to a six-month low in December.Brexit uncertainty will still bedevil the markets in 2020More than half (53 per cent) of firms reported that Brexit was one of their top three sources of uncertainty in December. That was slightly lower compared to the average of the previous three months. However, Brexit-related uncertainty remains well above its average since the referendum.Fears about renewed tensions between London and Brussels undermined the value of the pound. Sterling fell 0.4 per cent against the US dollar and 0.2 against the euro.The drop against the dollar wiped off some of the 7.9 per cent rise in the pound’s exchange rate in the final quarter of the year, which had made it the strongest currency pair in the 2019 rankings by Deutsche Bank.“Much of sterling’s gains came after prime minister Johnson and the EU agreed a new deal in October, and the gains in GBPUSD over the last three months mark the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2009,” said research analyst Henry Allen.Capital Economics, the London-based consultancy, believes the pound will end 2020 almost 4 per cent higher at $1.35 by the end of the year as the outlook for the UK economy brightens thanks to reduced political uncertainty and a large fiscal boost.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A keeper counts squirrel-monkeys at London Zoo during the annual stocktake.

Shopper numbers fell almost 9 per cent on Boxing Day, which used to be a traditional start of the sales, according to retail intelligence firm Springboard.“Consumers are increasingly using Boxing Day primarily for leisure purposes, going out to eat or to the cinema, but possibly combining this with a visit to retail stores rather than shopping being the main focus of the trip,” said Springboard\u0027s insights director Diane Wehrle.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The demographic\u0026nbsptimebomb is well known — even if no one has adequately dealt with it — and the vast global debt burden of $188 trillion (£143 trillion) is unlikely to be an issue this year as low as interest rates remain low, as most forecasters expect.But deglobalisation is proving to be a major threat to the global economy. Societe\u0026nbspGenerale\u0026nbsp(Soc Gen) has warned that financial globalisation is at a “tipping point”, highlighting the possibility of stagnation and even a slow decline in production links between economies.‘Alarm bells ring’ as factory output falls at fastest rate in 7 yearsSoc Gen, which forecasts global growth slowing from 3.2 per cent to 3.1 per cent between 2020 and 2021, says financial globalisation has slowed significantly. Annual cross-border capital flows have decreased by more than 60 per cent compared to the peak in 2007.There is a similar problem with the trade in goods. According to the World Trade Organisation, its member states slapped protective measures on $747bn\u0026nbsp(£571bn) of goods in the year to October, a 27 per cent annual increase and the largest since 2012.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

IHS Markit, which compiled the survey for the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply (CIPS), said UK manufacturing remained too reliant on consumer spending.Its monthly survey of factory managers, the first piece of UK economic news in 2020, showed the index fell to 47.5 in December, the fastest pace of contraction since July 2012. Any number below 50\u0026nbspsignifies contraction and the index has now been below that point for eight months in a row.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The pace of manufacturing’s decline in December will set alarm bells ringing,” said Duncan Brock, group director at CIPS. “Production levels sank at their fastest levels since July 2012 and with no sign of immediate recovery in sight.”The level of new work received declined for the eighth successive month in December as inflows weakened from both domestic and overseas clients.Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Managers linked the falls in new business to ongoing concerns surrounding the economic, global trade and political outlook. New export business fell for the second month running.The drop in activity has fed through to job numbers as manufacturers cut employment for the ninth month\u0026nbspin a row.Job losses were registered across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors and at companies of all sizes.“This impact trickled down to job creation strategies, as the pace of job losses intensified and companies were reluctant to commit to additional expense,” Mr Brock said.Mr Brock said although the result of the general election would bring some “clarity” to businesses, he warned that manufacturers faced a long road ahead to recover last year\u0027s losses. “In the closing stages of the year, the sector has ended on a dreary note,” he said. “There will still be some obstacles to overcome in 2020.”Manufacturers to end 2019 at ‘standstill’ over Brexit uncertaintyFhaheen Khan, senior economist at Make UK, the manufacturing and engineering employers’ organisation, said uncertainties over the outcome of Brexit, the outcome of the general election, and global trade tensions had “clearly weighed on” the UK’s manufacturing sector.However, CIPS said business sentiment remained positive in December with more than 43 per cent of companies forecasting output would be higher a year from now, compared to only 10 per cent anticipating a contraction. The optimism was linked to reduced uncertainty, new product launches, increased efficiency and improved client confidence, it said.The downbeat picture was reflected in the eurozone where the equivalent index dropped from 46.9 in November to 46.3 in December, marking an eleventh successive month of contraction. Germany was again the weakest-performing country, while the deteriorations seen in Italy and the Netherlands were the sharpest in more than six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also said its gauge of Brexit uncertainty in its monthly Decision Makers’ Panel survey fell to a six-month low in December.Brexit uncertainty will still bedevil the markets in 2020More than half (53 per cent) of firms reported that Brexit was one of their top three sources of uncertainty in December. That was slightly lower compared to the average of the previous three months. However, Brexit-related uncertainty remains well above its average since the referendum.Fears about renewed tensions between London and Brussels undermined the value of the pound. Sterling fell 0.4 per cent against the US dollar and 0.2 against the euro.The drop against the dollar wiped off some of the 7.9 per cent rise in the pound’s exchange rate in the final quarter of the year, which had made it the strongest currency pair in the 2019 rankings by Deutsche Bank.“Much of sterling’s gains came after prime minister Johnson and the EU agreed a new deal in October, and the gains in GBPUSD over the last three months mark the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2009,” said research analyst Henry Allen.Capital Economics, the London-based consultancy, believes the pound will end 2020 almost 4 per cent higher at $1.35 by the end of the year as the outlook for the UK economy brightens thanks to reduced political uncertainty and a large fiscal boost.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A keeper counts squirrel-monkeys at London Zoo during the annual stocktake.

Shopper numbers fell almost 9 per cent on Boxing Day, which used to be a traditional start of the sales, according to retail intelligence firm Springboard.“Consumers are increasingly using Boxing Day primarily for leisure purposes, going out to eat or to the cinema, but possibly combining this with a visit to retail stores rather than shopping being the main focus of the trip,” said Springboard\u0027s insights director Diane Wehrle.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The first (unauthorised) adaptation of Bram Stoker\u0027s Dracula is a masterful presentation of the Victorian fears the vampire represents - xenophobia, disease, female sexuality and death.Guillermo del Toro has made a career out of dreaming up all kinds of creatures – some nice, others not so – and the Reapers in Blade II fit firmly in the latter category. They’re a deadlier breed of vampire (yes, in this film you can be even more dead than the undead) and, perhaps even more terrifyingly, the lead carrier is played by Luke Goss.“You’ll never see anything like The Thing ever again,” John Carpenter once said of his 1982 sci-fi horror. Many critics at the time would have responded, “Good.” Upon its release, the film – which centres around a mysterious, malformed humanoid discovered buried in ice, that consumes and assimilates anything in its way – was met with a barrage of negative reviews.

The first (unauthorised) adaptation of Bram Stoker\u0027s Dracula is a masterful presentation of the Victorian fears the vampire represents - xenophobia, disease, female sexuality and death.Guillermo del Toro has made a career out of dreaming up all kinds of creatures – some nice, others not so – and the Reapers in Blade II fit firmly in the latter category. They’re a deadlier breed of vampire (yes, in this film you can be even more dead than the undead) and, perhaps even more terrifyingly, the lead carrier is played by Luke Goss.“You’ll never see anything like The Thing ever again,” John Carpenter once said of his 1982 sci-fi horror. Many critics at the time would have responded, “Good.” Upon its release, the film – which centres around a mysterious, malformed humanoid discovered buried in ice, that consumes and assimilates anything in its way – was met with a barrage of negative reviews.

Maybe in an attempt to avoid similar controversy to that which the comedian has courted in the past, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) has ordered the comedian to be on better behaviour\u0026nbspfor this year’s opening monologue.Will he listen? That remains to be seen – although much of the promotion of this year’s ceremony has been centred on the fact this will be Gervais’ fifth and final time as host, so he won’t exactly be looking to go out with a whimper.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGervais isn’t the only host to have cut down Hollywood’s elite with some shocking one liners, though. Both Tina Fey and Amy Poehler did so not too long ago – for three consecutive years, no less – and Seth Meyers had the tough task of hosting the year after the news of Harvey Weinstein’s harassment allegations came to light.Ahead of this year’s Golden Globes ceremony, we run through some of the most shocking jokes, ranging from one-liners about Leonardo DiCaprio,\u0026nbspGeorge Clooney and several about Mel Gibson.Click through the bellow gallery to see what made the listCreated with Sketch.

It seemed like everything this year was three-dimensional. Except the characters in The Tourist. I already feel bad about that joke. I tell you what, I’m jumping on the bandwagon because I haven’t even seen The Tourist. Who has?” There were a lot of big films that didn’t get nominated this year. Nothing for Sex and the City 2. No, I was sure the Golden Globe for special effects would go to the team that airbrushed that poster. Great job. Girls, we know how old you are. I saw one of you in an episode of Bonanza. “What you don’t know about Colin Firth is he’s very racist. I mean, really nasty stuff. I’ve also seen him punch a little blind kitten.

Consequently, she’s been nominated for nothing. Really pathetic. The Golden Globes are to the Oscars what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton: a bit louder, a bit trashier, a bit drunker and more easily bought – allegedly. Nothing’s been proved.  “For his role in Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew McConaughey lost 45 pounds. Or what actresses call, being in a movie.  The Wolf of Wall Street is another nominee tonight. I really loved the film, but some of it was too graphic. I mean, if I wanted to see Jonah Hill masturbate at a pool party, I’d go to one of Jonah Hill’s pool parties.”  “Gravity is nominated for Best Film.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In doing so, they claim to have created the world\u0027s most efficient lithium-sulfur battery.“The world needs radical new\u0026nbspenergy storage technologies to fight climate change,” Dr Mahdokht\u0026nbspShaibani\u0026nbspfrom Monash University’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who led the research, told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Lithium-sulfur batteries, which use extremely high-capacity sulfur, can store five-times as much capacity as traditional lithium-ion batteries, and are made from cheap materials that are available worldwide.”Associate Professor Matthew Hill added: “This approach not only favours high performance metrics and long life cycle... it is also can lead to significant reductions in environmentally hazardous waste.”Battery breakthrough revolutionises recharge times for electric carsThe research, which is published in\u0026nbspScience Advances, could be a major milestone for the battery industry and could impact everything from consumer electronics to solar grids.Dr Shaibani\u0026nbspsaid the commercialisation of the batteries may be between two to four years away, and a\u0026nbsppatent for the manufacturing process has already been approved.Prototype cells have been developed in Germany and further testing in cars and solar grids is set to take place in Australia this year.“Cost projections and performance metrics of our technology predicts for outperforming today’s lithium-ion batteries at high competitive price points,” said Dr Shaibani.\u0026nbsp“Altogether, this means that solar power could be much more easily stored, or an electric vehicle go a lot further, but more importantly, the battery is safe, simple and ethical.”​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bird, floating on the seawater beneath a cliff, held a stick in its beak.It began to scratch its back with the stick – the puffin, as Ms Fayet watched, was using a tool.Ms Fayet, a puffin expert who studies how the birds migrate and feed, wrote about the crafty bird in her notebook. But she had no photo evidence of this first-of-a-kind sighting. “It was just one observation, and I was busy doing something else,” she said. As unusual as this was, Ms Fayet said, she “kind of forgot about it”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUntil it happened again. In July 2018, Ms Fayet was studying another group of puffins at Grimsey Island in Iceland, about a thousand miles from Wales. She planted camera traps on the island and recorded “loads and loads of puffin behaviour”.Another puffin used a scratching stick. This time, the action unfolded in front of a camera: The bird spots a stick and grasps it with a cartoon-bright beak. The bird makes a burbling sound. It turns, as if to face the lens. And then it scratches its chest feathers with the stick’s pointy end.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Over 400 species discovered this year by Natural History MuseumThe ancient invertabrate worm-like species rhenopyrgus viviani (pictured) is one of over 400 species previously unknown to science that were discovered by experts at the Natural History Museum this year220 Jackdaws can identify \u0027dangerous\u0027 humansJackdaws can identify “dangerous” humans from listening to each other’s warning calls, scientists say. 320 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

This was not some nesting behaviour gone awry. Puffins collect soft grass for their nests, then hurry into their burrows with beaks full of bedding. The puffin in Iceland dropped the stick after it finished scratching. Hours later, the camera recorded the stick, still discarded, on the ground.This behaviour “fits all current definitions” of tool use, said University of Oxford zoologist Alex Kacelnik, who has studied toolmaking crows and was not a member of the puffin research team.Outrage over trophy hunts to Iceland to kill puffinsMs Fayet sent the recording to her colleague Dora Biro, an animal behaviour expert at the University of Oxford. The video immediately excited Ms Biro because, as she said, “this was a puffin, this was a seabird – and tool use had never been reported in seabirds before”. Together, with their colleague Erpur Snaer Hansen, the biologists described puffin tools in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Studying animal tools can help scientists understand the origins of our own Stone Age, which began when our ancestors picked up rocks around 2.6 million years ago. But tools wielded by beak, paw or snout are rare. Scientists have observed tool use in fewer than 1 per cent of species, which are erratically scattered among animal groups. Chimpanzees and several other primate species use tools. Yet so do sea otters, fish and even some insects, such as ants that sop up honey in spongy matter.Several bird species use tools. Crows in the Pacific, for instance, use hooked twigs to catch grubs. But back-scratching is an unusual form of tool use that the scientists called “body care”. The only other type of body care observed in wild birds, Ms Biro said, is “anting”, in which birds cover their bodies in insects. Bug juices, biologists suspect, can act as chemical defences against bird parasites or fungi.The puffin in Iceland may have been trying to rid itself of ticks. “At the time, when these observations were made, there was also a particularly high parasite load on the birds that year,” Ms Biro said. A scientist who reviewed Ms Biro and Ms Fayet’s paper suggested the stick could have had chemical properties, too. (That’s hard to say the twig was dry, and the scientists don’t know what sort of plant it was.)Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After all, why use a stick when a beak could do? He wondered whether the irritants on the puffins could be “toxic or particularly distasteful” – like a smear of boat fuel, perhaps – “hence the birds may have wanted to avoid beak contact”. In experiments, New Caledonian crows, the grub-fishing species, will use sticks to touch objects the birds perceive as dangerous, such as rubber spiders, he said.Or, maybe, the satisfaction of an itch well-scratched is just one of those things that transcends species.University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible.

They do not buy clothes made of wool or leather, or use products tested on animals.The landmark decision means ethical vegans are entitled to protection from discrimination.In order for a belief to be protected under the act, it must pass a series of tests including being worthy of respect in a democratic society, not incompatible with human dignity and not conflicting with fundamental rights of others.In the hearing on Thursday, the court heard Mr Casamitjana was dismissed after he gave colleagues details of the charity’s pension funds, which revealed that some invested in companies involved in animal testing.He claimed he was whistleblowing, but the charity said this had “no substance” and had “absolutely no connection with why Mr Casamitjana was sacked”.Golden Globes to only serve vegan food at this year’s ceremonyWe tested Gregg’s new vegan steak bake and this is what it’s likeWagamama launches vegan tuna made from watermelonIt added the reason for his dismissal was confidential but said it was sad that a former employee was taking action against one of the UK’s most vegan-friendly employers.Mr Casamitjana said: “Although the manner in which I was dismissed was intensely distressing for me, some good may come of it if I am able to establish this valuable protection for all ethical vegans.”Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He called for the Brexit vote to be overturned by parliament just two days after the 2016 referendum.Mr Lammy told The Independent that he believed this meant he would struggle to win back Leave voters who abandoned Labour at the general election, and had therefore decided to stand aside.“I am emboldened by the many people who share my view and have been humbled by the many members of the Labour Party and the wider British public who, over the past weeks, have sent messages, emails and tweets encouraging me to stand as a candidate to be the next Labour leader.”He continued: “A key role for the next Labour leader is to win support from and foster unity between different vociferous factions of our party, so that we can win back the trust of our country. I am not the inidual best placed for this role at this time.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Child mortality is at record low levels. Famine virtually went extinct. Malaria, polio and heart disease are declining.Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist, in , I’ve been faced with, “what about. . . ” questions: What about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump  How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that The answer is: Because bad things happen while the world still gets better.That is to say, our population and economy would grow, but we would learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved.Scientist Andrew McAfee documented this in his book More From Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less metal, less water and less land.This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us.But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: “Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist,” ask him this: “But whateconomic growth means using less stuff, not more ”For example, a drink can contains  grams of aluminium, much of it recycled. In  it contained  grams.Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.As for Britain, our consumption of “stuff” probably peaked around the turn of the century. The evidence is there.In  Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing the UK was now using not just relatively less stuff every year, but absolutely less.Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain fell by a third between  and , from . tonnes to . tonnes.That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.Think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player newspaper and a pack of cards.LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices use much less paper.Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected.For instance, how much water the world consumed in  was half as much as experts in the s predicted. Inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.Until recently, most economists assumed these improvements were almost always in vain, becauseyou cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy hungry and people leave them on for longer.But Andrew McAfee argues that doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching “peak farmland”. Despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land.In , Jesse Ausubel, of The Rockefeller University in New York, and his colleagues argued that thanks to modern technology, we use  per cent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with  years ago.By  it is estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy.John Constable, of the Global Warming Policy Forum think tank, points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled since , and our population is up by  per cent, energy consumption has fallen by almost ten per cent.This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues. Although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, planes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminium and chemical industries abroad with some of the world’s highest energy prices.In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems.Innovation requires experiments . Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial.Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of.Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early s, The Limits To Growth, in America, and BlueprintFor Survival, in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels.The Limits To Growth predicted thatgrowth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before . School textbooks soon echoed these claims.This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that five metalswould cost less in  than in .The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutesmetals grew scarce.Simon won the bet easily, and Ehrlich sniped that: “The one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles.”To this day, none of those metals has signicantly risen in price nor run out. A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff.A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than a system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt.Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional methods.Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer in a new direction. To do so risks retarding progress.As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction.By the end of it we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture.There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer and each of us will use fewer resources.The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Employers such as the MoD and the NHS had said they were safe.But it simply wasn’t true . . . and at least  rogue operators were free to roam in a “scammer’s paradise”.To add insult to injury, the victims — some of whom have reported feeling suicidal — are now being fined for unknowingly participating in these schemes, which broke tax laws.And who’s to blame  Tony Blair and his Labour government, who relaxed rules around HMRC enrolment in , allowing dodgy pension schemes to sign up with virtually no checks.This was supposed to bring “security, dignity and comfort in old age”. Instead it has unleashed a nightmare.Perhaps instead of lecturing us on Brexit, Blair should reflect on his devastating legacy.IN her bid to become the next Labour leader, Rebecca Long-Bailey has promised “progressive patriotism”.It sounds as nonsensical as the party’s economic policies. After all, there’s nothing “progressive” about this vile, anti-semitic version of the party.Nor is there anything “patriotic” about Long-Bailey’s loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, the man who counts Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA as his friends.So it comes as no surprise that Corbyn’s cronies are apparently trying to shorten the Labour leadership contest in order to boost Long-Bailey’s chances and “stitch-up” other hopefuls.Her proclamation of patriotism shows utter desperation.Labour spent years treating anyone who’s proud to be British as lowle scum, only to have that backfire on them at the election.Many are proud of this country and enthusiastic about Brexit.It’s a bit too late for Corbynistas to pretend they feel the same.IT looks set to be a very happy New Year for many British workers.Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced that the minimum wage for over s will rise by p to £. an hour in April.After years of “Spreadsheet Phil” Hammond and his Brexit fearmongering, this is exactly the boost Britain needs — both for the economy and spirit.So let’s join the three million who’ll be toasting Mr Javid on New Year’s Eve. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Things can only improve on the last four years of anger, ision and political paralysis.A period which should have been pivotal to our country saw it barely governed at all.

That wages must be driven up and food banks rendered redundant.That the Tories must continue striving for a cleaner environment without ­caving in to economy-wrecking panic.And we of course share the desire for a kinder, more united country — echoed by the open letter from faith, ­culture, sport and business leaders.The Sun is optimistic about that too.In fact we do not agree we have suffered a “decade of ision”. Yes, it was tough financially. But we were far from ided at, say, the  Olympics.The anger in our Parliament, offices, factories and homes was caused by Brexit, specically by some Remainers’ refusal to accept defeat, and by a Labour Party engulfed by the hostile hard-left.The Brexit heat is fast dissipating now. Boris’s triumph saw to that. Many Remainers are making their peace with it . . . and even seeing its opportunities.Which leaves but one obstacle to the national healing.No one has done more to ide us than Jeremy Corbyn, his thuggish, often anti-Semitic followers and his obnoxious media apologists.Their relentless hatred and dishonest demonisation of opponents toxied both political discourse and Labour’s election fortunes.Yet none of the contenders to replace Corbyn grasps this reality: They can remain a Twitter-obsessed, Tory-hating clique of middle-class Marxist posers calling each other “comrade” but disconnected from working people.Or be viable, mainstream contenders for Government.

Whichever box we ticked in the election, millions of us vote green with our lestyles.A recent survey of Sun readers showed  per cent recognise climate change is real and that  per cent of us worry more about our environmental impact now than they did five years ago.And  per cent of Sun readers want to make their habits greener still.Some of them make their voices heard.Retired receptionist Eileen Webster, , says “climate change is the big issue facing the next generation”, while Anna Lubecka, , demands new PM Boris Johnson, “start making good plans for climate change”.Attitudes to environmentalism have shted so much that being green is now no longer the preserve of lentil-munching hippies and Swampy, it is totally mainstream.No trendy bar would now dare put plastic straws in their cocktails.We’ve all got used to carrying Love Island-style water bottles and happily adopted reusable coffee cups. This year they pulled off a plastic-free Glastonbury, despite a few hiccups.We’ve long stopped grumbling about taking our own bags to the supermarket and got used to stuffing our pockets with them when we leave the house.So now in England, the average person uses less than a tenth of the number of single-use plastic bags than we did five years ago. Only around ten a year, compared to  in .As electric cars have improved, we’ve all been seduced — and not just by Tesla’s new “bulletproof” Cybertruck. Overall, demand for electric cars has jumped, with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders finding that this November alone electric car sales leaped by . per cent, with more than three times as many new battery-electric vehicles registered as in the same month in .Nowhere  is it clearer that green has become the new black than in fashion, where criticism of fast fashion has led to trends for vintage, second hand and renting rather than buying.On the high street, companies such as HM have launched their “conscious collection” , fashion bible Vogue has championed sustainable designs, while French President Emmanuel Macron’s “fashion pact” — presented at the G summit and intended to make the industry more sustainable — has been signed by more than  brands, including Nike, Zara and Gap.All these changes prove how far we have come and the impact Greta has had.Hearing her, strong and calm, on Radio ’s Today programme this week, what struck me is that now another change is needed.This time a sht not in our actions, but in how we approach the environmental debate.It’s not beliefs but attitudes that need to change. Until now, environmental issues have been too isive.Butwe want real change we’ve got to move beyond blame.It puts people off environmental issues when campaigners hector and shame them.When wealthy celebrities such as Sir David Attenborough criticise normal people for taking holidays with cheap flights, or actress Emma Thompson jets back from America to harass normal people driving to work.In the same way Extinction Rebellion threatens to lose potential supporters when it starts fights with commuters trying to board their morning train or cause mayhem in central London.The real danger is that by being so aggressive, these green campaigners risk putting people off.Greta seems to know this. She is much calmer than she used to be when speaking in public.Rather than getting angry or emotional, instead she has stressed the importance of just, “listening to the scientists”.As usual, we could learn from her.The reality is most people want to be green.We are all concerned about global warming, pollution in the seas and the kind of planet we are creating for our grandkids. But you can’t shame people into doing something.Diesel drivers — especially White Van Man — shouldn’t be harassed just for getting to work. I’m sure they would buy more environmentally friendly vehiclesthey could afford to.Likewise, no one should be shamed for taking a flight — who knows what other measures they might be taking, such as living in a carbon neutral home What the planet needs least is more fighting.

No way was it what I had written.”And the -year-old teen’s lawyer told The Sun a close examination of the language used in her statement retracting her rape allegation suggested it was not in her words.Forensic linguistic specialist Dr Andrea Nini said: “The linguistic evidence supports the hypothesis that all or some parts of the statement were not composed by the girl.“They were from a non-native English speaker. The combination of words is not what an educated English speaker would say or write.“What it appears to be is words dictated to her by someone  who didn’t speak English as their first language.” The confession reads:“The report I did on the th of July  that I was raped at Ayia Napa was not the truth. The truth is that I wasnt raped and everything that happened in that appartment was with my consent.“The reason I made the statement with the fake report is because I did not know they were recording  humiliating me that night I discovered them recording me doing sexual intercourse and I felt embarrassed so I want to appologise, say I made a mistake.”Dr Nini said: “It is very unlikely a native English speaker would write ‘report I did’ — it would be ‘the report I made.’“Also an English speaker is more likely to say ‘not true’ rather than ‘not the truth’.“The statement also contains the word apartment which is misspelt with an extra p and is more American than English. ‘Discovered them’ is also not a native English speaker’s phrase.“It’s more consistent with a person who has English as a second language.“Perhaps the most telling is the use of the phrase ‘doing sexual intercourse’ — a native English speaker would say ‘having sexual intercourse’.”The -year-old’s conviction on Monday rests on the validity of the retraction statement, which she is said to have written and signed ten days after the rape.But Dr Nini’s analysis bolsters the well-educated teenager’s claim that the many grammatical errors and spelling mistakes prove it was not written by her.Her lawyer Michael Polak said the statement was written in “Greeklish”.And he insists it was given under duress after almost eight hours of hostile questioning and with no lawyer or translator present — a breach of her human rights.The teenager’s friend, who comforted her as she sobbed and told of the hotel room rape by  Israelis, today insisted the Cypriot police never had any intention of taking them seriously.She added: “It was a stitch-up from the beginning. It felt asthey had made their minds up without even bothering to listen to us.We weren’t taken at all seriously and it felt aswe were being kept in the dark the whole time.”She told of her shock at the way in which her witness statement was taken by an investigating officer.The -year-old, who had been out for a meal with the teenager earlier, added: “There was just me and him in the room and he kept saying to me ‘So you were both drinking a bit that night ’“He was implying that we were drunk and I said that wasn’t the case. He was trying to suggest that it was all our fault because we were drunk. But we weren’t. He was writing my statement as he wanted to interpret it.”Police initially arrested  Israeli men aged between  and  in connection with the attack.But all were later released without charge and allowed home.Police say the teenager invented the rape claim after discovering film of her having consensual sex with one of the Israelis had been posted online.The teenager had started seeing the Israeli a few days earlier and had gone to a hotel room with him after having a meal with her friend.During her trial she told the court they had sex but she asked him to stop when he became violent.A HUMAN rights lawyer has slammed the conviction and said the idea the teen willingly took part in an orgy is a “ridiculous porn fantasy”.Harriet Wistrich, of the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “I’ve never met a woman who’d consent to .I believe she had sex with one then was treated appallingly by his friends.As I understand there is video evidence of her asking the men to leave the room then they posted what they filmed online, which is particularly offensive.There appears to be a lot of material available.“She confessed under duress. To me the conviction is unsafe.“It’s also tortuous for her having the judge drag it out for so long. I don’t understand his motive.”She said he then pinned her down and his friends burst into the room and raped her.The girl, from Derbyshire, was found guilty of public mischief earlier this week and faces a jail sentence of up to a year and a maximum £, fine when she is sentenced on Tuesday.Yesterday we told how the teenager and her mother called on Boris Johnson to personally intervene to put an end to her suffering before she is sentenced. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He designed it, built it then realised it was far too savage and bitey to live in, say, Milton Keynes.Or the poisonous redback spider which likes to hide under lavatory seats so it can bite a man’s penis when he sits down to do his number twos. No way could God have that living in Europe or the US.He also made a lot of snakes. Some are very pretty and some are very impressive.But occasionally it all went wrong and he ended up with something that could kill a fully-grown man with one small bite. And again, these could not live in populated areas.He needed a home for all these things, so he made Australia.And to make sure people didn’t go there, he put a huge coral reef on the approaches and filled the interior with a sea of sand that goes on for ever.He even used this remote outpost to house some of his more ridiculous ideas. Stuff he came up with when he was drunk.Like those birds that can’t fly and that otter with a beak.Then you have the kangaroo, which gets about by bouncing, and the koala, which is permanently stoned and catches chlamydiaanyone ever picks it up.For millions of years, this big, sandy cupboard under the stairs went unnoticed.But then along came Captain Cook and now the world knows all about Oz and its stupid, dangerous creatures.Plainly, God is embarrassed. Because he’s decided to set fire to it.It’s been argued the fires raging across the country were caused by global warming or out-of-control barbies.But when you look at the footage, you know something biblical is going on.Those things are huge.Skies have been turned red by the flames. Choking smoke is blanketing millions of acres.Thousands of homes have been obliterated. And people are dying.This has happened before in recent years and there’s no doubt it will happen again.Which means people must accept that Australia isn’t meant for human habitation.Soyou’re reading this down there, please come home.You’ll like it. It never stops raining. And we are better at sport.DURING World War Two, General de Gaulle used London as a base and to say a belated thank you, current president Emmanuel Macron is thinking of giving the city France’s highest award for honour.Needless to say, lots of people are now jumping up and down in Paris saying the Legion d’Honneur cannot possibly be given to London as England and France are “hereditary enemies”.No we aren’t. Germany is our hereditary enemy and not just on the football pitch.France, meanwhile, is just some place we visit to buy cheese and wine.We have no idea what it’s like to fight France because it always surrenders before the battle’s got going.ALL of us begin a new decade with hope in our hearts that it’ll be better than the past one.Not me. This is thanks to two things.Firstly, there’s Libya. Since they shoved a scaffolding pole up Colonel Gaddafi’s bottom, it has been a lawless haven for terrorists and lunatics.Today it’s run by factions of the Judean People’s Front and the Popular Front For Judea, with one backed by Turkey and Qatar and the other backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.There’s going to be a bloodbath. And this is a country less than  miles from mainland Europe.Which means we are going to have to get involved. Becausewe don’t, Russia will.That’s one reason, then, that I fear for the coming decade.The other is that at some point in the next ten years, statistically speaking, I am likely to die.TWENTY years ago, Britain created the perfect argument for not allowing anything to be nationalised or run by the Government.It was called The Dome.Created to mark the end of a millennium, it cost £million and was filled by right-on frizzy haired vegans with things no one wanted to see.There was a plastic human you could walk through, a multi-faith zone and lots of global warming malarkey.Unsurprisingly, it was a spectacular flop.So after a year, it was given away to a property company which turned it into the O, a music venue that now rakes in £million a year. Led Zeppelin had their reunion there.As I’ve always said, governments should put up park benches and run the nuclear submarines.And that’s it. Everything  should be run by the private sector.AS we all trudge back to work, with the fog making our hair frizzy and the puddles reminding us we need some new shoes, we will develop a teeth-rattling hatred for all those celebrities on Instagram who are frolicking in the Caribbean or sipping green juices on a beach in the Males.Amanda Holden. Pippa Middleton. Myleene Klass. Grrrr.Except,you think about it, you and I don’t have to find someone to put sun cream on our back five times a day.We aren’t being eaten alive by mosquitoes. And while a wet pavement isn’t very romantic, it’s better than hopping about, yelping, on a superheated white beach.Also, we will not have dicky tummies from the weird food, bad heads from the cocktails, puffy eyes from the jet lag and the constant worry we’ve been papped while bending over.And what’s more, we didn’t have to spend half an hour at an airport waiting for someone in a high-visibility jacket to take an X-ray photograph of our genitals.TECHNICALLY speaking, the fabulous goal scored by Wolves against Liverpool last weekend was not a goal at all.Because careful examination of the footage showed one of the players involved in the build-up was offside by .mm.It may have been three in the morning. The road may have been empty and the skies clear. And there’s no way you should have to waste a day on a speed awareness course as a result.But technology means we live in a time when there is no grey area. Pity.Many of the kids were explaining how they’d given up meat to save the planet and that Greta Thunberg may be Mrs Jesus.But then, instead of actually going walking, they stayed in the car, running its V diesel engine to keep warm.I WAS asked the other dayI’d be starting the year by doing Veganuary.FINALLY, may I wish everyone a very happy New Year.And extend a big thank you to Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott for making such a thing likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If she’s really troubled about racism in the Labour Party, why did she spend the past three years campaigning to get anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn into Number  Andshe’s a serious contender for the leadership, why does she spend half her time doing interviews about herself for glossy magazines Yes, personal brand is important. Butthe country is really in the state Jess claims, shouldn’t she be busy fixing it The Labour leadership contender is determined to paint herself as “likeable” and “relatable” but, right now, she’s coming across as a vacuous narcissist. And a slippery one at that.The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn has so far involved the candidates hamming up their northern accents, trying to out-working class each other, or desperately bigging up their woke credentials to the Press.No one has yet adopted a whippet or done a Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP and potential leadership hopeful who this week described herself out as “pansexual” — attracted to people regardless of sex — but it won’t be long now.For the casual bystander, it all makes for a good laugh. Emily Thornberry’s hysterical claim that her family was once so poor they had to put down a cat sounded so ridiculous in her cut-glass accent, it distracted commentators fromAngela Rayner’s far more legitimate tales of hardship — much to the comical irritation of the latter.For anyone serious about rebuilding the opposition, though, this farcical leadership race is no joke.While Labour contorts itself into a web of wokeness, the Conservatives are quietly cementing their new blue wall in the North.Why  Because outside leftie London and a few university towns, no one cares about tick-box ersity or even the le stories of politicians.Yes, having a “powerful backstory” is usefulyou want to make self-indulgent MPs weepy in the Commons, but it won’t persuade voters that you’re capable of getting things done.And as Boris Johnson proved so decisively last month, getting things done is what counts.The Eton and Oxford-educated Prime Minister looks and sounds nothing like most of the voters in Bishop Auckland or Redcar, but he persuaded them that he was serious about pulling Britain out of a rut.That, it turned out, was enough for an -seat majority.DOMINIC CUMMINGS is spot on: What this country needs is some more nerds.Stuffing the Civil Service full of people who meet gender and ersity quotas is all very well, butyou want employees who bring a fresh perspective, you need recruits who actually think dferently.A tech-obsessed -year-old who skipped university to pursue a career in coding could teach Whitehall’s swarms of humanities graduates a thing or two. And anyone prepared to give up a social le to work for the Government would likely do a far better job than the current civil servants who knock off at pm on a Friday.Bring on the geeks.The Opposition should now take a leaf out of his book.The last election was calamitous, yes, but with  per cent of the vote, Labour is still the second-largest party in British politics.That’s a powerful base for a recoveryit picks the right leader.The challenge is finding that person. As things stand, the field isn’t inspiring.Rebecca Long-Bailey — though a box-ticking superstar — doesn’t have the demonstrable competence that voters are yearning for from Labour.And poisonous Thornberry, who once tweeted a sneering comment about a Rochester home decorated with English flags, will repel patriotic voters.Butthe party is prepared to ditch the ersity nonsense and ignore pious pundits shrieking that the new leader “must be a woman”, the picture is rosier.The unbearably smug Keir Starmer — key player in the doomed People’s Vote campaign — would go down like a ton of bricks in Leave-voting areas.But someone like Dan Jarvis, who has called for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era, may just have what it takes.Under Corbyn, Labour proved once and for all that wokeness doesn’t win elections.With the exception of naive students and hipster Londoners, voters don’t much care whether their politicians wear flat caps, headscarves or top hats. They just want politicians who are unafraid to act.So now MPs have a choice.Either they nominate duds with tear-jerking back- stories and shore up their majority in Putney — the right-on London seat which provided the only cause for celebration last time.Or they change tack, abandon wokery, and unearth a strong, competent leader, who might be up to the mammoth task of rebuilding the broken party.It really couldn’t be simpler.PO-FACED leftie commentators must stop laying in to journalists who call Boris “Boris” .They’ve been fighting a losing battle for years. And rightly so.Given Johnson is the third most common surname in the UK, it’s practical – not chummy – to call the Prime Minister by his much rarer Christian name.But, more importantly, the fact our PM is known by his first name on the world stage should be a source of pride to Brits.After three dreary years of Theresa May, Boris’s gravitas and quirky iniduality could hardly be more refreshing.It’s time to embrace it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tory ministers want families to dig their gardens this weekend and plant their redundant trees, rather than send them to the tip. If thereaposs no option to plant your trees, ministers also suggest checking whether councils have a special collection service - though that could prompt criticism, given the Tory cuts to councils in recent years. Or ministers suggest a recycling service that could use the trees to build flood barriers or turn them into path chippings or soil. The call is a boost for the Mirroraposs Million Trees campaign which aims to plant a million trees over five years. Today, just % of the UK is covered in trees, compared to the EU average of %. Globally,  billion more are cut down than are planted every year.  We have waged our fight with A Trillion Trees, a joint venture of the world’s largest conservation charities – WWF, BirdLe International and Wildle Conservation Society who are together fighting deforestation and to restore forests around the world. As Britons prepare to strip their festive trees before twelfth night and Epiphany on Monday, Environment Minister Rebecca Pow urged households to consider keeping their trees. She said: “Millions of families around the UK celebrated Christmas with a beautul fir or spruce tree in their home, but when the decorations are taken down it’s important that we dispose of trees sustainably. “If you have a tree with its roots still attached, then replanting your Christmas tree is a great way to reduce your carbon footprint and help our efforts to plant more trees.” According to the British Christmas Tree Growers Association, between six and eight million real Christmas trees are sold in the UK every year.If not reused or recycled, real trees can end up in landfill. Sending eight million trees to the local dump would cost about £million. A typical six to seven foot high Christmas tree is between  and  years old. Nordmann Firs are the most popular in British homes, making up % of those sold, with Norway Spruce making up  to %. According to the Committee on Climate Change, the Government’s statutory advisers on the climate crisis, the UK should have .billion new trees by  to meet its net zero carbon target. But last year just , hectares of its ,-hectare yearly target were planted. The Government said real Christmas trees which were not replanted can be shredded into chippings, which can be used in parks or woodland areas.

She follows colleagues Clive Lewis, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry in announcing she wants to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Corbyn is standing down following Labouraposs crushing defeat in last monthaposs general election, which saw its worst performance since . Writing in the Wigan Post, Ms Nandy said believes the party has to change to regain the trust of voters after suffering the huge loss. She said the drubbing at the hands of Boris Johnsonaposs Conservatives - which included losing swathes of seats in its northern heartlands - was a long time coming”. And she argues that the next leader should come from those areas which feel neglected and are turning away from the party, with a deep understanding of the problems the regions face. She said: It has been  years since Labour last won power, and I want you to know I have listened and I understand that we have one chance to win back the trust of people in Wigan, Workington and Wrexham. Without what were once our Labour heartlands we will never win power in Westminster and help to build the country we know we can be.  I know that a Labour Party led by someone like me is something many of you do not believe is possible. I think we can, and must, show that it is. “I have heard you loud and clear when you said to earn that trust means we need a leader who is proud to be from those communities, has skin in the game, and is prepare to go out, listen and bring Labour home to you. “I wanted to tell you first that I’m standing to be leader of the Labour Party because after a decade of having the privilege to represent you, I have a deeper understanding of what has gone awry in our discredited political system.  “I’m standing because I know too many people in places like Wigan no longer feel they have a voice in our national story. So many of you have told me you believe many leaders are not interested in what you have to say and are unable - or unwilling - to understand your lives. I believe you are right.” Ms Nandy, who served as the shadow energy secretary from  to , said she was heartbroken that so many working class constituencies had chosen the Conservatives over Labour at the last general election .  She criticises Westminster heavily in her leadership pitch, calling for devolution and decision-making abilities for “every town, city, region and nation in the UK”. She says she wanted communities to be able to create a dferent future for themselves, not rely on top-down initiatives from governments. She added: “Now is not the time to steady the ship or try not to oversteer. What is needed are the hard yards of winning the argument inch by inch in town halls, workplaces and pubs.

Word of the latest closures was spread by members of the public who posted photos of store closure signs in shop windows on social media. However, in many cases HMV has not made any public announcements. The outlets affected are in Leeds, Reading, Plymouth, the Bullring in Birmingham, Worcester, Bury St Edmunds, Grimsby, and Nuneaton. Reading’s HMV store in The Oracle launched a closing down sale on January , and closing down posters were put up in the mall. However, it is unclear whether the store is closing down for good or whether it’s relocating. Plymouth’s Drake Circus HMV is making way for a fresh retailer, leaving the centre on January  and re-opening in the former Maplin store in nearby Cornwall Street, also in the heart of the city centre. One disappointed shopper wrote on Twitter : “My heart dropped when I saw the Closing sign, then realised they’re just moving, sad to see the store go by glad Plymouth will still have a HMV! #hmv” .Have you seen an HMV close down near you  Email webnews@mirror In Grimsby, the Freshney Place branch announced it will shut its doors later this month with for sale signs on almost all of its products and ‘store closing’ signs in its windows. However, HMV says it’s in talks with Freshney Place regarding the closures, and will inform customers “ anything changes”. A HMV spokesperson said: “At this time, talks are ongoing with the landlords involved and are currently progressing in a positive direction. “Thank you to the community for their ongoing support for us and we will let you knowanything changes.” Meanwhile, HMV in Worcester’s Crowngate Shopping Centre will close its doors on January  after the new business owner said the store was ‘no longer viable’.  A spokesman from HMV said: “Regretfully we can confirm that HMV Worcester will be closing, despite our desire to continue trading in this location.” HMV Nuneaton in the Ropewalk Shopping Centre will also close at the end of January after it was unable to agree a new deal with the landlord. Meanwhile, in Bury St Edmunds’ Arc Shopping Centre, the music will close its doors on January , and is rumoured to be making way for sports retailer JD Sports. HMV’s Birmingham store in the Bullring shopping centre is due to pull down its shutters at the end of January. Staff were told the opening of an HMV in the entertainment store at the fringe of the city centre, called HMV Vault, would eventually lead to the Bullring closure as its overheads are much higher. At the moment there isn’t a signicant sale at the store, though some prices have been discounted but many vinyl products have not. A statement issues by the Bullring shopping centre’s owner Hammerson said: “We can confirm that the HMV store at the Bullring is due to close. HMV recently opened Europeaposs largest entertainment store with Hammerson, HMV Vault, at Birmingham’s Dale End. Bury, which was also thought to be closing its store, announced on Twitter this morning that it would ‘stick around a lot longer’.

It is believed she bought her own Princess Diana lookalike engagement ring in the sale. She claimed Saunders paid her back for the blue silver oval blue Cubic Zirconia cluster ring. A friend said: “She says the ring is in the box ready to go back and she wants a refund.” The jewellery store’s website promises “very few would know the dference between this and the ‘real thing’.” It emerged this week that Saunders was jailed for  five years in  for having sex with a teenage girl. He was seen smiling after leaving her ground floor flat yesterday. The mum-of-seven insisted they were “done” and said he slept on her sofa. Matthews also claimed his belongings are packed in a Primark bag but a date has to be arranged between them for Saunders, a handyman, to collect his stuff. Matthews met him just six weeks ago and a whirlwind romance led to a proposal. A little over a week later, police arrived on her doorstep to arrest him. Thames Valley Police confirmed they had arrested a -year-old man from Reading, Berks, on “suspicion of a breach to his notication requirements”. He has been released under investigation. The paedophile was caught after indecent images of his victim were found on his mobile phone. In January , Oxford crown court heard that his offences took place when she was aged between  and . He was placed on the sex offender register for le. His victim said after he was jailed: “He makes me sick. He should die. I hate him.” Matthews was jailed ­alongside her ex-boyfriend’s uncle Michael Donovan in  for faking the kidnap of her nine-year-old daughter in her native Dewsbury, West Yorks. She sparked one of the biggest missing persons hunts before her daughter Shannon was found after  days hidden under a bed in Donovan’s flat. Prosecutors said that the ­schoolgirl was drugged and probably kept on a leash.

Trapped indoors, some never leave their tiny cages and suffer devastating illnesses ranging from depression to brittle bones. Some are so badly neglected they need to be put down. Rescue workers say their popularity as pets is rising thanks to celebrity owners and a desire to stand out on social media. Tens of thousands of primates across Europe are in desperate need of rescue but are left to suffer as sanctuaries are now full. Rachel Hevesi, of Wild Futures monkey sanctuary in Looe, Cornwall, said: “The UK trade, which is still legal, leads to huge psychological and physical suffering. “Every time a celebrity is pictured holding a monkey we wonder what this will do to the demand. We have to turn away mon­­keys in desperate need as our sanctuary, and others, are full.” Breeding and selling small monkeys such as marmosets and tamarins is legal with a licence under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act. But welfare experts say as few as % are actually licensed. The exact number of primates kept as UK pets is unknown. In  it was estimated at up to , but given the inc­­reased popularity, it could now be higher. Capuchins are among the most popular. Two years ago they would fetch £, but they now sell online for just £ due to a surge in home breeding. Capuchin Joey was imported from South America with legal papers. But once in his UK home he had no access to direct sunlight, was alone for  hours a day and was unable to exercise.  He ended up with rickets and also rocked so obsessively he developed an open wound at the base of his spine. Primate expert Dr Ben Garrod, from the University of East Anglia, said: “Primates do not make good pets. Keeping them drives their extinction in the wild. “It’s hard enough for a zoo to keep a healthy population let alone someone who, even with the best intentions, simply doesn’t have the time, money or expertise.”  Dr Garrod said  European countries have some form of ban on pet primates and called for them to be made illegal here.He also called celebrities such as Justin Bieber , who share pictures with pet mon­­keys, “morons”. The RSPCA, which has urged action for years, said it received calls about monkeys most weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"traditional saturday jobs dying teens","story":"NewsTraditional Saturday jobs dying as teens sht focus towards their school workThe proportion of  and -year-olds with weekend jobs or other part-time em­­­ploy­­ment has halved in the last  years with better grants and a need to study being blamedShareCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business:,  JAN NewsThe traditional Saturday job is dying out \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Waitrose Asian inspired BBQ Mushrooms with Sticky Rice How much: £. What’s in it: Aromatic sticky rice is partnered with marinated and roasted portobello mushrooms, pak choi and pickled vegetables in a spicy chilli and garlic sauce. Taste verdict: I was so keen to try this dish that I burned my mouth in excitement. But it was definitely worth it. The tangy sauce and thick strands of mushroom partnered perfectly and were almost meaty in texture. In fact, there wasn’t mushroom for improvement. Rating:   I’d definitely miss out on meat to enjoy this meal again.  MS Beetroot and Carrot Bourguignon How much: £. What’s in it: MS have made their bourguignon with root vegetables to be served with a caullower mash. Taste verdict: One of new items available in the Plant Kitchen vegan range, the Beetroot and Carrot Bourguignon was filled with huge chunks of root veg and the ready meal was certainly filling. The creamy mash went down a treat too! However, there was a slightly sweet after-taste to the dish due to the beetroot sauce, which was a little off-putting. Rating:   Tasty enough but meat can’t be beat for this classic.  Pizza Hut Pepperphoni pizza How much: £. for a regular-sized pizza. What’s in it: Pea protein and Viole vegan cheese provide the perfect basis for this plant-based pizza. Taste verdict: Bubbling with “cheese” as I opened the box, this pizza looked like any peperoni fan’s dream. The taste was good but was overshadowed by the rubbery texture of the topping, which left it feeling a bit stodgy. If you fancy a pizza then I’d look where for a slice of the action. Rating:   Only real pepperoni can cut the crust when it comes to a Pizza Hut takeaway.  Subway Meatless Meatball Marinara How much: £. What’s in it: The new sub features the same delicious marinara sauce as the original. However, the plant-based alternative is stuffed with vegan cheese and plant-based meatballs. Taste verdict: The Meatball Marinara is one of Subway’s most iconic sandwiches, so it was a bold choice to create a plant-based alternative for Veganuary. However, this was just as good as the original. The meatless meatballs had a nice, authentic texture and the sauce was so good that my only criticism is that I would have liked more. Rating:  : Definitely not a sub standard attempt at a meat-free alternative.  Wagamama Vegan “tuna” How much: £. What’s in it: The strange sounding dish is made with dehydrated watermelon which is sliced, seared and served hot to give the texture of tuna sashimi. Taste verdict: This concoction tastes just as odd as it sounds. Surprisingly, on first appearances, the hot watermelon looked just like regular sushi but just one bite had me screwing up my face as my brain struggled to come to terms with what I was eating. And, at nearly £ a bowl, there’s definitely something a bit fishy about this idea. Rating:   I wouldn’t bother with this. Butyou still fancy going vegan then Wagamama’s have a range of other dishes, such as a Yasai Katsu Curry or Kare Burosu Ramen, which are plant-based without being too peculiar.  KFC Vegan Burger How much: £. What’s in it: Casting their signature chicken aside, KFC use an Original Recipe Quorn fillet for their vegan burger. This is then coated in the restaurant’s special  herbs and spices and served in a sesame bun with fresh lettuce and vegan mayo. Taste verdict: As a big fan of The Colonel’s chicken I was a little sceptical about whether KFC could work in vegan form. But the Quorn fillet was seasoned perfectly and aside from a slightly chewy texture was more than a bit moreish. Rating:   A finger lickin’ good opportunity to replace meat this Veganuary.  Costa Vegan Smokey Ham  CheeZe Toastie How much: £. What’s in it: The coffee chain boasts that it’s plant-based snack is made with Quorn smokey ham and coconut cheese sandwiched between two slices of vegan bread. Taste verdict: This was a simple offering from Costa as part of their new vegan range. Unfortunately, there wasn’t much filling, so the toastie was a little thin and the Quorn was hard to taste. But the vegan cheese was soft, melty and hard to distinguish from any other piece of cheddar. Rating:   If Costa added a little more filling then the original cheese and ham toastie would be... well... toast.McDonaldaposs Veggie Dippers How much: £. What’s in it: Both vegan compliant and gluten free, McDonalds’ Veggie Dippers are made with red pepper, rice, sundried tomato pesto and split peas. They’re also coated with light and crispy breadcrumbs.

Emily Elliott, , of Huddersfield, attempted to take her own le just weeks after she split from partner Shay Doyle, who she met at Huddersfield University. She recovered and they rekindled their relationship, but a few months later Emily was found dead at home. Mr Doyle discovered her body on June , several months after they had initially broken up because Mr Doyle had been contacting another girl through Facebook , Bradford Coroneraposs Court heard. The two former University of Huddesrfield students had a turbulent relationship, assistant coroner John Broadbridge heard. Mr Doyle, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, gave evidence in front of Miss Elliottaposs family including her father Stan and mother Zarah Khilji as well as her brothers Fox and Jacob. He explained they had met initially as friends at university around  . Miss Elliott, a former Greenhead College student, had studied Sociology but failed her course after the first year while Mr Doyle studied a Graphics Design course. The court heard she was a very attractive, sociable young woman who had lots of friends and worked in bars and clubs such as The Warehouse, Camel Club and Mavericks. She had also worked previously at Tesco in Marsh. Mr Doyle was questioned by Mr Broadbridge about how their relationship began. He said: After eight-to-nine months there was flirting and getting a bit closer to one another. She lived with me and three of my friends in Huddersfield for a while, a couple of months. I would say we had a good relationship though we had the odd argument like any other couple. We split up. I had been texting another girl through Facebook. The coroner asked him: Can you accept that Emily was extremely distressed when she found out about this relationship and, to say the least, reacted badly  Mr Doyle agreed that was so. He was then questioned about Miss Elliottaposs attempt to take her own le in February . Mr Broadbridge asked: How soon did that occur after your separation  Mr Doyle, who admitted he was not good with dates replied: A friend told me. A month or two after it happened. Mr Broadbridge told him the attempt took place on February  and said: So it would not be a month, it would be a matter of weeks or days  Mr Doyle said: I found out a month or so after it happened. He said they had blocked one another on social media in the aftermath of his cheating but at the end of March had rekindled their relationship, though by now he was living in Wilmslow. Mr Doyle said: Things were going well, we talked about having children together.  But the court heard that on Thursday,  June, Mr Doyle got no response when he tried calling her so he sent a text message to one of her best friends, Kimberley Knight, askingshe had heard anything to which she replied that she had had some weird messages from her. Mr Doyle caught a train to Huddersfield Rail Station and then a cab to her home which she shared with her father. He broke down in tears as he told how he found the front door open. He said: I went upstairs and Emilyaposs bedroom door was closed. He opened the door and found her unresponsive. He said he screamed for help, dialled  and attempted to perform CPR before paramedics took over. The coroner asked him: Was there any clue in those few days that she was desperate, that she might harm herself  Mr Doyle replied: No. The coroner said: Were you shocked at what you saw  Mr Doyle: Yes. After hearing a wealth of evidence about Miss Elliottaposs history of mental health problems, previous overdose attempts and heavy drinking the coroner concluded that she had taken her own le.

They first burst onto the scene with a now-viral gymnastic  performance on Australia’s Got Talent in , and whilst they might not have won the show, their act catapulted them into the social media spotlight. Now with regular posts of their workouts, routines and behind-the-scenes videos of their lestyle across their ious social media channels, the twins from Perth, Australia, have been racking up hundreds of thousands of followers daily.  Now, a shock new insight in their new book Twinning It! has revealed how a simple leg pain could have ended the -year-olds’ careers. Teagan writes: “ Sam and I had been mucking around on the grass doing a whole heap of acro, especially one trick we were trying again and again — a no-handed somersault in the air to land on your feet,” “While we were going this trick, I started noticing a pain in my leg.”  After the pain persisted for two weeks she went to the doctor and it was revealed to be a lesion which would need to break down and heal the only way of allowing this to happen would be to stop dancing.  Devastated Teagan went to get a second opinion from a sports injury specialist who created a plan for her to continue dancing but ease off while the lesion repaired itself. She revealed in an interview with news.au  that a further x-ray had revealed the lesion had doubled in size and was now an aneurysmal bone cyst.Surgery to remove it was a success and after a five month recovery she was able to start building up her strength again. LIFESTYLE  The pair now focus on feeding their largely teenage demographic fanbase with content. Regularly posting videos about their friendship circle, as well as, of course, stunts and performances. Ever the social media professionals, they never miss an opportunity to engage their audience, asking them questions or inviting people to subscribe. In fact, their short snappy lestyle insights on TikTok have recently gained them more followers than their highly-successful YouTube channel. Challenges such as pink food days or fun yoga help promote their healthy light-hearted attitude to food and exercise. The twins, who train  hours a day as well as teaching dance classes, previously told the MailOnline that a typical day’s food is:Breakfast - cereal and fruit or smashed avocado eggs on toast Lunch - smoothie bowls with fruit, nuts and high-nutrient seeds Dinner - high protein meals such as quiche and chicken salad With their new book crammed with advice and tips on how to balance family and fun with a successful social media business, it is clear the pair feel a responsibility to their largely teenage demographic.  "},{"url":null,"title":"man who gave cpr costa","story":"NewsMan who gave CPR in Costa del Sol triple tragedy says deaths were preventableJosias Fletchman, , says the Club La Costa World in Spain needed a leguard and walkie talkies to prevent the tragedy that saw three family members drownShareCommentsByLila Randall:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video man-costa-del-sol-hotel-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news man-who-gave-cpr-costa-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Josias Fletchman, , from Manchester, was on holiday at the Costa del Sol resort when three family members lost their lives. Gabriel Diya, , his daughter Comfort, nine, and his son Praise-Emmanuel, , drowned at the Club La Costa World in Spain on Christmas Eve. Mr Fletchman knew something was seriously wrong when a Spanish woman ran into a hotel lobby making a “death cry”. He was one of the first people at the scene and gave CPR to Praise-Emmanuel at the poolside. The youth support worker has said the deaths could have been preventedthere was a leguard manning the pool at all times andstaff had walkie talkies to alert colleagues at the hotel, rather than running to noty reception. Three cleaners who could not swim were the first to arrive at the scene and they had to wait several minutes to get help. Mr Fletchman said: Iaposm not going to sit here and blame anybody, but...it was my family that it happened to... Iaposd be raising alarm bells.”  He added, My Diya “wouldn’t have had to jump in” to try and rescue his childrenthere was a leguard. Mother and we Olubunmi Diya previously claimed her familyaposs deaths were caused by a fault with the pool. A police spokesman described the tragedy as a freak accident and put it down to a lack of swimming ability. The resortaposs operator, CLC World Resorts and Hotels, said the police investigation confirmed the pool was working normally and there was no mal of any kind.  In an initial statement, the resort’s operator CLC World Resorts and Hotels said hotel staff found the three guests unresponsive in the pool, prompting first response teams and emergency services to administer first aid. On December , the resort published its condolences to the family, saying it was “devastated” by the tragedy. It added: “The Guardia Civil have carried out a full investigation which found no concerns relating to the pool in question or procedures in place, which leaves us to believe this was a tragic accident which has left everyone surrounding the incident in shock. “Naturally our primary concern remains the care and support of the remaining family members. Mrs Diyaaposs -year-old daughter, Favour, was also in the pool at the time of the tragedy and had become scared after realising the deep-end was located in the centre of the pool. Favour said she managed to get out of the water and threw a le buoy into the pool when her brother screamed for help.  In a statement to Spanish police, she said: “We never thought the deepest part of the pool was in the middle and the slope in the pool made her [Comfort] slide towards the middle and that was the reason my sister was there and the reason why I ended up slipping towards that area.” “I realised I was out of my depth soon after I got into the water. “I got scared and only managed to get out of the water with some effort because I’m not used to swimming in places where the water is deep and I can’t stand up. A police source said investigators were informed the three relatives didnapost know how to swim or didnapost swim very well. The source also discredited speculation about the pool pump system that could have made it hard for the group to swim, noting that investigators found no evidence pointing to any anomalies like increased suction pressure.

By the time she was , she had her first set of twins and following that quads, triplets and twins just kept coming. Mariam suffers from a rare genetic condition and by the time she was  she had given birth to  children. She was also left to raise her massive brood alone when her husband walked out on her four years ago. The devoted mum has three sets of quadruplets, four sets of triplets and six sets of twins. She works tirelessly to make sure she feeds her youngsters and keeps a roof over their head. Mariam works as a hairdresser, an event decorator and collects and sells scrap metal. She also brews her own local gin to sell and makes herbal medicine. Mariam is determined her children will have all the chances in le that she was denied. Most of her wages are spent on food, medical care, clothes and school fees.  Photos of her older children graduating from school hang proudly on the walls of her home. But despite Mariamaposs best efforts, one of her children, Ivan Kibuka, had to drop out of school to help raise the family. The -year-old said: Mum is overwhelmed, the work is crushing her, we help where we can, like in cooking and washing, but she still carries the whole burden for the family. I feel for her. Mariam and her children live in tough conditions in just four tiny homes in Uganda. The buildings are made from cement bricks and a corrugated iron roof and they are surrounded by coffee fields.  Mariamaposs own childhood was filled with heartbreak and tragedy. Just three days after she was born, Mariamaposs mum walked out on her, her father and her five siblings. Her father re-married but her step-mother poisoned Mariamaposs older siblings by mixing cut glass in their food. Mariam was the only one to survive because she was visiting a relative. She said: I was seven years old then, too young to even understand what death actually meant.  I was told by relatives what had happened. Losing her siblings at such a young age meant Mariam was desperate for a family of her own. She only ever wanted six children but her rare genetic condition meant she had unusually large oies. She was warned by a doctor that any birth control, like the contraceptive Pill, would cause her problems. After her first set of twins, Mariamaposs babies just kept coming.  Large families are the norm in Uganda, with women having . children on average, but Mariamaposs family is gigantic even by these standards. When she was , and having given birth to  children, Mariam begged her doctor to stop her having any more babies. But once again he was told that the best thing for her to do would be to keep getting pregnant because her oy count was so high. Almost four years ago Mariam fell pregnant for the final time - and it ended in tragedy. While she was in labour one of her twins died.  Then her husband, who would often be absent from the family home for long periods, abandoned her and his children for good. His name is now cursed in Mariamaposs family. She said: I have grown up in tears, my man has passed me through a lot of suffering. All my time has been spent looking after my children and working to earn some money. But her last baby also meant Mariam finally got the help she needed to stop having more children.  Dr Charles Kiggundu, a gynecologist at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, said: Her case is genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate, which is releasing multiple eggs in one cycle, which signicantly increases the chance of having multiples it is always genetic. Mariam says medics took action to stop her becoming pregnant again. She added that her doctor told her he had cut my uterus from inside. Mariam and her massive brood share the four, tiny, homes where the walls are caked with dirt and grime.

That was a dficult time.“We’ve had loads of ups and downs but the past year is certainly one, for the first half of it anyway, we want to put behind us as quickly as possible.“With the recent bit of form and positivity, we take that into  and kick on.”Dundee start the year with three home matches on the bounce, firstly against potential play-off rivals Caley Thistle and Ayr United before they welcome high-flying Premiership side Motherwell to Dens Park for a Scottish Cup tie.“We have dficult games coming up. We have three games at home now and we need to get back to making this place a fortress,” Kerr added.“I said it at the start of the season that,we wanted to do anything in this league, we’ve got to make our home form much better than it has been.“It is better than it has been over the past year but it’s still not where we want it to be.“That’s something we are working so hard every day to put right.“Every game we go into, we expect ourselves to win. That’s not being arrogant or cocky but what Dundee should be aiming for.“There needs to be a realisation of how good this squad can be.”And Kerr says the second half against league leaders United last Friday gives everyone associated with the club belief they can start looking upwards.“There was a wee realisation after the game we could have taken three points.“The boys have spoken since and we’re starting to realise how well we can do as a team.“After we got the goal at Tannadice, there was a belief on the pitch and I think the fans felt that.“Even when the board went up for how long was left, the fans still thought we could win it.“Hopefully, that is a wee turning point for us – it needs to be going forward.“There has been a lot of disappointment, a lot of games where we have huffed and puffed throughout the season.“Last Friday, the fans came again in their numbers and I didn’t expect there to be so many, to be honest.“United had three of the stands but our fans were so loud again and when we scored it was great to go and celebrate with them.“Our fans have had to endure a dficult year, especially with United being on top since day one.“We are happy with how it went but, at the same time, we need to make sure we don’t rest on a draw – we need to remember we didn’t win – but use it to kick us on.”Dundee have faced the Caley Jags three times this season, winning -, drawing - and losing - last time in Inverness.Dundee United - Dundee: Dorrans# first goal earns Dee derby point\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united---dundee-dorrans-first-goal-earns-dee-derby-point embed # secretynOUlpvmC\" data-secret\"ynOUlpvmC\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Kerr added: “We are under no illusions how tough it will be tomorrow.

win for his side and the second a late leveller at Tannadice.He may only have made  appearances for the club before injury ended his career early but McPake’s leadership on the pitch earns him a place in this team.Andrew RobertsonVery little has to be said about this choice – Robertson was a star in the making at Tannadice.Arriving as an unknown -year-old from Queen’s Park, Robertson swtly made the left-back place his own and became well-known for rampaging runs down the flank.Just a year later, he was off to Hull City for £. million and has since become a European Cup winner with Liverpool and Scotland captain.His  games for United brought five goals.Midfielders:Gary Mackay-StevenThe wing wizard edged out Dundee favourite Gary Harkins for the right-wing berth in our team.‘GMS’ was an entertainer with an array of tricks and flicks and was a major part of the free-flowing football that made the Tangerines a regular top-six outfit under Jackie McNamara.Stuart ArmstrongArmstrong and ‘GMS’ were inseparable at the top end of Scottish football for years before the former moved down south to Southampton.Armstrong’s athleticism and ability on the ball made him the focal point of United’s attack during six years at the club from  to .Kevin ThomsonHe may only have played  times for the Dens Park club.However, Thomson’s ability and nous in the middle of the park played a huge role in Dundee’s top-six finish in -.Craig ConwayA man scoring two goals in a Scottish Cup Final win is a must for a team like this.A compact, tricky attacker, Conway went on to enjoy a fine career for himself down south after making his name at Tannadice.Strikers: Greg StewartPlucked from Cowdenbeath, Stewart was arguably Dundee’s Player of the Decade.Shortlisted for the -

draw at Tannadice showed exactly why Dundee United are where they are.The Dark Blues probably were the better team in the end and they’ll take plenty of positives out of it but it was a good result for the Tangerines, too.I agree with manager Robbie Neilson saying his side didn’t play as well as they could have.For some reason, they looked a bit anxious and nervy in the second half which is completely unlike them.United had done so well in the previous derbies and been so assured it was a surprise to see them just lump the ball forward as the game wore on.However, the sign of a title-winning team is they can still take a point despite not playing well against one of the better sides in the ision.And they even extended their lead at the top as, once more, the other sides failed to take advantage of United dropping points.For James and his side, they were far better than previous derby showings, that much is obvious.It was a step forward for them and will give their fans a positive jolt heading into the new year.I still think they have problems creating chances.They had lots of good play in the second half but still can’t convert that into clear-cut opportunities.Look at the stats and, though Dundee about edged the game for me, United still had more shots on goal.I do think the way the Dens gaffer has set up his team recently suits them better and that showed on Friday night.There’s more balance in the midfield with Fin Robertson and Graham Dorrans taking turns to control things in the middle.It’s taken a while, which is understandable given the big changes in the summer, but James is starting to find a good formation and his best starting XI.These things always take time but it seems like the Dee are getting there.The key is they kick on from here.For United, it’s about ticking over and keeping themselves well clear of any trouble at the top.Sounds like there were a fair few interested parties at the derby, no doubt taking a look at Lawrence Shankland after his goalscoring exploits this season.It wouldn’t surprise methose English clubs were keeping an eye on Robertson and Dorrans either, the way those two are performing."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united right to call out racism","story":"Watching the derby on TV there were a few times I thought things might spill over from the stands.I wasn’t expecting any alleged racism to come out from the any part of the support, however, as appears to be the case from a video that has emerged.I think Dundee United have handled it in the right way, calling it out strongly.There’s no place for any sort of racism at football – or anywhere  for that matter."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/Omar-Pacha-Dundee-Stars.jpg ","title":"in form stars end year on a high by toppling giants in belfast","story":"Kitmart Dundee Stars won their third-straight match as their final-period surge lted them to a -

Referees need to use it better in England by looking at the monitor more and taking a bit more time to consider the situation and get the right decision.“For major decisions, such as sendings-off and goals, I still think the stats show it works. They get about % of decisions right, which is a lot more than we get now in these situations.”SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell recently commissioned a study into the costs and benefits of bringing the controversial system to the Scottish game.Chairmen of member Scottish clubs will be askedthey will be willing to follow the footsteps of England, where VAR was introduced at the start of the current season.Scotland’s leading referees have reportedly backed the introduction of VAR, which has been used in major tournaments such as the  World Cup and  Women’s World Cup.Maxwell recently said: “In the early part of  we need to be goingand saying, ‘there’s the cost, guys, do you want to do it or not ’”In the aftermath of the recent - win at Celtic, Rangers managing director Stewart Robertson, in a club statement, urged Scottish football chiefs to get on board with VAR to help assist referees with dficult decisions.However, the system has been heavily criticised south of the border for being used wrongly to reverse marginal errors.Five goals in the Premier League were ruled out last weekend for marginal offsides, leading some managers and players to slate VAR.In November Liverpool striker Roberto Firmino was denied a goal against Aston Villa after the VAR team declared a goal-scoring part of his body was offside – in this case his armpit.McInnes still reckons VAR,used correctly, can reduce errors. He said: “VAR minimises the mistakes and frustrations sometimes with decisions.“It is something we should be going all out to get into our game.”It is expected the projected £m annual cost will have to be paid by the clubs.That will likely come from the league distribution prize pot, which is the money left over when all other costs are taken off, or the SFA prize pot distributed to clubs.There is also the possibility the new £m deal with Sky Sports for the Premiership television rights could fund VAR.The Sky Sports deal begins at the start of the - campaign and runs for five years, with the broadcaster screening up to  games per season.A six-year Scottish Cup deal with BBC Scotland and Premier Sports worth £m was also recently confirmed by the SFA.Ultimately whether Scotland will introduce VAR will come down to the finances and whether lower-league clubs will be willing to sacrice some of their income for something only implemented in the top flight.A recent incident where VAR would have been pertinent was the controversial red card shown to Sam Cosgrove in the - defeat to Celtic at Parkhead.Cosgrove was shown a straight red by referee Euan Anderson for a challenge on Kristoffer Ajer.The Aberdeen striker clearly won the ball when running in at speed and footage confirmed that.Aberdeen appealed the dismissal and subsequent two-game ban.However, the appeal was rejected by a fast-track disciplinary  and Cosgrove’s suspension stood for the games against Livingston and Hearts.In the immediate aftermath of the Celtic defeat, McInnes admitted VAR could have helped Cosgrove’s cause.He said: “VAR could have helped out, but you still need the referee to make the right decision.”McInnes is for VAR but it will take the majority of the other  clubs to agree for the controversial system to be introduced."},{"url":null,"title":"meet rg mowat owner of the fulmar","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew.

At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application. I am disappointed by the decision but it went through the democratic process."},{"url":null,"title":"mekala-osbornes-family-put-christmas-hold-recovers","story":"The -year-old, from Wallyford, a former Preston Lodge High School pupil, fell ill while travelling through Vietnam with what was originally diagnosed as bronchial pneumonia.After being put into an induced coma in a critical condition, Mekala was moved to a hospital in Singapore before she eventually travelled to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.Mekalarsquos mum Yvonne Bonnar McAulay said Mekala was now able to sit up in a chair for several hours a day and was being weaned off a ventilator however she said it feels like a bit of a ldquostandstill time in her recovery.She told the Courier: ldquoDue to everything thatrsquos happened, we feel itrsquos appropriate to put Christmas on hold.ldquoWe will have a wee breakfast for [her brother] Danny: he doesnrsquot understand Christmas so itrsquos pretty much another day for him, but we are doing our best to give Danny his own wee special Christmas Day.ldquoGranny is helping out so I can spend the afternoon and some of the night with Mekala.ldquoIt is a long road ahead as she needs to get her lungs working properly and then concentrate on gaining her muscle back throughout her body, then physio will start.ldquoShe will be in isolation until after the year.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

This is the first step towards bringing agricultural beasts back and using them to improve the conditions of the productive land on the island.As well as paving the way towards the reintroduction of farming activities, the cows presence is hoped to help boost bioersity and help support corncrakes and rare species such as the Slender Scotch Burnett Moth.Subtle signs of activity on Ulva come  months after the island celebrated a controversial pound. million community ownership deal largely funded by public money.Some argued it was a harsh day for the islandrsquos owner, Jamie Howard. Recently widowed and whose family had owned Ulva for three generations, his hope to sell to his preferred bidder was removed from his hands by Scottish Government community land reform rules.Others, however, embraced the move as a new dawn for an island which had suffered at the hands of th and th-century owners.In , the population of Ulva and neighbouring Gometra ndash attached by a narrow bridge ndash stood at . Within seven years it would slump to a mere  and by the s, Ulva, a favourite spot for Beatrix Potter, Sir Walter Scott and visited by James Boswell and Dr. Samuel Johnson, would have just seven families left, with crofts abandoned and properties in ruins.Since the change of ownership, however, interest has soared among people keen to visit and, perhaps surprisingly for a remote spot with no car ferry, school, shop or roads, to set up home.Recently a survey by the North West Mull Community Woodland Company Ltd, which as a result of last yearrsquos community buyout owns Ulva, revealed its population could balloon by , per centall applications to become its newest residents were accepted.More than  people have lodged their interest in living on the island: a challenge, given there are currently just a handful of residential properties and no infrastructure other than a single restaurant ndash The Boathouse ndash to support them.There are, however, big plans. And the arrival of the Highland cattle, says Ms Reid, are just the start.By next summer, the six residential properties are expected to have been fully refurbished. The plan includes the restoration of a Thomas Telford-designed manse, built in the s and long abandoned, and there have been hints that its neighbouring church could one day become a music venue.Further ahead, there has been talk of a proper campsite, mini-hotel and hostel for tourists who want to extend their visit, an oyster farm and shops. Itrsquos been suggested that within a decade, Ulva could be home to at least  people, rising to  by .Certainly, there is a major rise in interest: visitor numbers have boomed from around , a year to over , over the course of the past year, raising questions over the tiny islandrsquos ability to cope with the additional footfall.ldquoThere has been a signicant increase in the numbers of people coming across to visit, says Ms Reid. ldquoIt will lead to pressure on infrastructure on the island, but we are working on a number of things to manage it and to give visitors a more erse experienceldquoWe are very aware of the impact of more visitors and we dont want the island to be overwhelmed.Those who made the short journey from Mull during recent weeks may have noticed subtle changes. For a start, volunteers have tackled the overgrown walled garden at Ulva House which, until the buyout, was the fine B-listed mansion home to the Howard family.Plans for the house are said to include refurbishing half to become a high-quality self-catering property which would fund the running of an interpretation and educational centre in the other half.Further plans are understood to focus on the development of infrastructure to support house plots for sale and self-build and for the construction of rented accommodation.If the cattlersquos recent arrival signies a giant leap towards theof an agricultural sector on the island, there is another sign of a new era.Sheila MacFadyen was a dairy maid for the Clark family, Ulvarsquos owners until the mid-th century. The last resident of a row of humble cottages, she left for Mull in the s.She died in , but her blackhouse remained to become a crucial part of island heritage and destination for visitors curious to discover more of the islandersrsquo basic way of le.Work on its restoration is now complete. Even \"Sheila\" ndash a mannequin which has sat huddled in a corner of the tiny home ndash has had a revamp, and become another highly visible sign of change on Ulva.ldquoThe mannequin had become quite spooky, she was looking tired and ragged, explains Ms Reid.ldquoWe have had a donation of Harris Tweed for a new skirt, and volunteers in Mull are giving her a bit of a new look. Once shersquos had her makeover, shersquoll sit at a spinning wheel that has been done up along with information boards and maps.Sheilarsquos Cottage, she adds, will remain at the heart of island le ndash a vital link with times gone by and a bright new future.ldquoThere has been a huge amount of effort behind the scenes, processes and paperwork and consultations that people canrsquot see.ldquoThe re-thatching of Sheilarsquos Cottage and the arrival of the Highland cows is very symbolic people can see things happening.ldquoWe are planning to announce a number of major plans in the new year.ldquoWe are on the cusp of a new start."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-next-time-anyone-asks-sideways-tilt-head-answer---managing-decline","story":"Wersquod all have to take a turn as Pat ie patroller driven around the city until the early hours, calling in at police stations and hospital portersrsquo cubby holes wearily askinganything were happening.There the gruesome, the tragic and sometimes the surreally comic, tales of the city at night were held up as pickings for early hours copy to be inserted into the latest issue.The guys had to be careful, though, when introducing themselves to the punters as the much-beloved Pat Roller, after one became a night incident himself when floored by a drunk who said: lsquoNah, yoursquore no.

They clearly didnrsquot think Jeremy Corbyn believed in Britain or had the nationrsquos best interests at heart.Now, one of Mr Corbynrsquos disciples, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has recognised this. In her leadership pitch in theshe has called for Labour to adopt ldquoprogressive patriotism to bring the country together. She is suggesting that Labourrsquos electoral problem was not just opposition to Brexit but its ambivalence regarding the nation.Ms Long-Bailey doesnrsquot see why patriotism should be the property of the right. We should celebrate ldquoLancashire mill workers who supported Abraham Lincolnrsquos anti-slavery blockade of cotton from the American South. But even this tentative and politically-correct version of patriotism proved too much for s of Labour purity on Twitter. She was taken to task for spreading ldquoloathsome nonsense...Tory Lite...dog whistle nationalism. ldquoProgressive patriotism is an oxymoron, said one critic, ldquolike humane fascism. For many supporters of Jeremy Corbyn love of country is irremediably toxic.During the long Brexit culture war, this attitude finally alienated Labourrsquos older, socially conservative voters in the Midlands and North of England. The question is whether Labour has the will or the capacity to win them back. It would have to go a lot further than history lessons about anti-slavery.Can you imagine Momentum activists saying how much they love Britain and its history  Can you hear David Lammy say that, actually, Britain is not a racist country  Mr Corbyn saying that the British Empire wasnrsquot all bad Imagine Ms Long-Bailey saying that our armed forces are the best of British. Or that most men are kind and loving fathers and not part of an oppressive patriarchy. Twitter would go into meltdownLabour started talking about controlling immigration.I just canrsquot see Labour becoming patriotic in a way northern English voters would recognise. Stormzy would be furious.would say it had gone populist, fascist, even.But the inconvenient truth is that many voters just seem hard-wired to regard their community and their country with pride. It is a lot to do with accentuating the positive. The relentless miserablism of the Left leaves people with nothing to feel good about. Itrsquos like watching a permanent Ken Loach film.Scottish nationalists used to make the same mistake of revelling in miserablism. They banged on about how Scotland was impoverished and demeaned by England and how theyrsquod stolen our oil. Then in the noughties it discovered positive nationalism and started talking up Scotland as a progressive country that could be a model for the world. Inclusive, democratic, equalitarian.It worked. The SNPrsquos electoral dominance today is directly related to its celebration of Scotland. The  referendum campaign, with its Yestivals and Saltires, was all about feeling good about being Scottish.Could Labour learn from this  Or has Labour sold its soul to a version of liberal identity politics which loathes the very idea of nations  Labour intellectuals like Emily Thornberry laugh at flag-waving English patriots. Labour academics regard Britain as a neocolonial power, with blood on its hands, oppressing people abroad and racist at home.This is why this General Election could be terminal for Labour. Unlike in Scotland, the English Left seems incapable of finding any positive dimension to nationalism. Britishness is seen as inherently right wing and racist ndash even though Britain gave the world parliamentary democracy, abolished the slave trade and led the defeat of fascism.The Tory PM is dismantling the overtly racist, imperial nationalism of Churchill and Thatcher, in favour of the self-mocking, popular nationalism of the  Olympic Opening Ceremony. Danny Boylersquos pageant of English identity was of course authorised by Mr Johnson as London Mayor. It featured NHS nurses, Chartists and icons of popular culture. Thatrsquos the kind of One Nation Conservatism that Boris Johnson is grasping for, and is temperamentally capable of delivering.It is about reflecting the nation in a favourable light, but it is also a way of doing politics. The Prime Minister is successful because he is relentlessly positive. He makes people feel good about themselves. Labourrsquos characterisation of him as a hard-bitten racist demagogue doesnrsquot ring true. Mr Johnson is actually more in the hail-fellow-well-met mould of one Alex Salmond, who made the SNP what it is today.Mr Salmond too was a gted populist leader, a romantic nationalist who loved Scottish history and understood the importance of supporting the Scottish regiments, even the Queen. The media regarded him with suspicion, but many Scottish voters loved him. He wedded nationalism to social democratic themes of inclusion and equality. In his  Hugo Young lecture on progressive nationalism he hailed left-wing policies, like tuition fees, as the ldquosocial wage.Unlike Mr Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon does not like nationalism, and is quite obviously embarrassed by it. Shersquos even said she would like to remove the word ldquonational from the party name. Butshe did she would risk throwing the cultural baby out with the liberal bathwater. The SNP was an early the beneficiary of the wave of populist nationalism that has now swept England.SNP intellectuals loathe the idea that Scottish nationalism might have anything in common with Brexit and English nationalism. But the similarities are too obvious to ignore. They were both populist rebellions against globalisation and neoliberalism by people who love their country and seek sanctuary within it.How these two nationalisms, Scottish and English, learn to coexist ndash or donrsquot ndash will decide the future of the United Kingdom.

Usually, each side plays two games over the weekendoften against the same team resulting in signicant travel, not only for the players but the fans that opt to follow them.The Glasgow Clan fans, known as the Purple Army, have attracted much attention in recent years due to their loyal fanbase and large travelling numbers.

And it was this dedication and reputation that led to me arriving just before  am outside of Braehead to embark on an away day with the Purple Army.The round trip to Belfast would see these fans onthe road for around  hours, and I sought to find out what motivates Clan fans to spend hours travelling to watch their side play ice hockey and why such a niche sport has picked up such a loyal fanbase.I arrived for the bus departing Braehead with films downloaded on my phone and comforts that would let me pass the journey sprawled out across the bus, however, I was astounded to find three coaches awaiting over  members of the Clan fanbase who had opted to travel.

But no, not according to the right wing press or the left wing ultras who are piling in behind it. They cannot forgive Sir Keir for having the temerity to earn more than the national living wage selflessly saving people in far-off places from being executed on the basis of shaky evidence seems to be beside the point as far as they are concerned. Using his prodigious talents, not to make squillions in the City as so many Tory MPs routinely do, but to try and make the justice system fairer ndash that counts for little.

How very dare he.He is now front-runner to win the Labour leadership election according to a poll this week, but the savage campaign to discredit him has begun even before hersquos formally declared as a candidate: expect to hear a whole lot more about the ldquomillionaire metropolitan lawyer, as his detractors have branded him. Even his pro-Remain stance seems to offend his opponents less than this.The danger now is that this plays into a Stalinist tendency on the Labour left to demonise anyone who isnrsquot deemed working class enough.Itrsquos absurd to campaign for better opportunities for working-class people only to shoot down anyone who makes the best of those opportunities, including public servants. Itrsquos also an odd form of logic to argue that former Labour voters who merrily backed the millionaire journalist Boris Johnson might be put off by the less well-off human rights lawyer Sir Keir Starmer.But there is also huge electoral danger in seeking narrowly to represent one narrowly defined social class, when the importance of class identity has been diminishing.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard is one Corbyn acolyte who likes to throw the ldquoc word about. Here he is in June : ldquoWe need to stop iding people on the basis of nationality and start uniting people on the basis of class to bring about real change. Really  Both are isive, making people who donrsquot subscribe to those forms of identity feel unwanted. But thatrsquos not the only problem: itrsquos also patronising to tell people which party they should vote for on the basis of their perceived class.In Scotland, Labourrsquos historic decline in the early st century can partly be blamed on taking working class voters for granted and treating them asthey had a tribal duty to vote Labour. Those voters disagreed and the SNP benefited from their disaffection.Britainrsquos class system is sadly alive and kicking, but it is in flux, and not just because the mines are deserted and the factories have fallen silent. Itrsquos because demographics have changed due to a ersying economy and progressive educational policies. People whose parents fitted the traditional definition of working class are now more likely to see themselves as being middle class.Being ldquoworking class is also harder to define than it once was. The ABCversus the CDEclassication system is decades old and based on rigid definitions of occupation. It takes little account of the gig economy, in-work poverty and graduate debt, things that unite the interests of iniduals across old traditional class lines.But perhaps, above all, things have changed because there are many other forms of identity that are even more important to people than their class background. Identity is now much more likely to be values-based.National identity matters, but social media has created new groups of like-minded people on everything from climate campaigning to sexual identity which have little to do with their geographical community or social class. Age is now more of a predictor of voting intention than occupation or income so is the yawning liberal conservative ide.Britain is a heinously unequal society and desperately needs a party that represents the interests of the have-nots over the elite, but the answer is not a Corbynite Labour Party that thinks nothing has changed in  years. Surely Labourrsquos crushing election defeat proves that.After Tony Blairrsquos landslide in , the Conservatives went through three leaders in quick succession ndash William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard ndash each moving the party further to the right. It took eight years for the penny to drop that the party must try and appeal to middle-ground votersit was to regain power.There is a clear and present danger of Labour making the same mistake, by tacking left and adopting a new leader in the image of the old one and consigning the party to years in opposition.Sir Keir is not the messiah but characterising him ashe were a virtue-signalling champagne socialist, is a gross injustice. A man of substance and conviction with real-world achievements to prove it, he would certainly be a heavyweight opponent to our flighty self-serving Prime Minister.His  per cent showing in the poll of Labour members, compared to  for Mr Corbynrsquos anointed favourite Rebecca Long-Bailey, speaks volumes about the frustration of Labour members with the leadershiprsquos failed form of class politics.There is a long way to go with this contest and it is taking place before the causes of Labourrsquos failure on December  have been fully understood.

But the compromise is vital.So too is to try, where possible, to stop looking at issues as binary.A hugely problematic and frustrating element of public discourse that has developed is the habit of seeing people as for us or against us.

It needs a compelling offer on the constitutional question, without which it will struggle to get the public to respond to the many positive policies it advocates and constitutional rather than class politics will continue to dominate.Although Ms Sturgeon has called for Indyref in , there appears little prospect of Boris Johnson giving Holyrood the power for it.The SNP MP Kenny MacAskill this week admitted the chance of Indyref in  was probably ldquonil and that was ldquono bad thing, given the SNP had yet to fix problems in its losing independence prospectus of .Mr Smithrsquos call for the Scottish Labour party and trade unions to back Indyref follows two Labour MSPs, Monica Lennon and Neil Findlay, agreeing with Ms Sturgeon that the Scottish people should decide its timing, not Westminster.Also writing in the new Scottish Left Review, Mr Findlay said: ldquoWe cannot deny the people of Scotland a second referendum where the majority is calling for it.

The Government would later pay out more than pound, towards Mr Salmondrsquos legal costs.It got worse for Ms Sturgeon when the opposition whipped up a Holyrood committee to examine where it all went wrong, and why she unaccountably kept in touch with him during the probe.The other parties made little secret of their desire to string the process out to the  Holyrood election to keepMs Sturgeon on the back foot.But then Mr Salmond ed to court in very dferent circumstances.On January , he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court and was charged with  offences, including attempted rape and sexual assault. He strenuously denied any wrongdoing.The Holyrood inquiry was put on ice.Also in January, it emerged two patients had died at the pound million Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow after contracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings.The QEUH would stay in the headlines for the rest of the year, a gathering cloud over Scotlandrsquos largest health board and a scandal that still has a long way to run.The annual SNP-Green Budget pact saw Holyrood dip a toe into one of its taboo powers ndash the ability to invent taxes.A tourist tax and a workplace parking tax were the result. The latter saw the other parties, especially the Tories, rev themselves into a frenzy. The din over a pound a week parking bay levy was all out of proportion to its impact.Far more signicant, yet less noisily received, was the failure of SNP ministers to deliver the devolved welfare system they had demanded for years.In February, they admitted they had not fully assumed responsibility until , more than three years late.Critics said it made of mockery of the partyrsquos previous promise to deliver independence in a fleeting  months.In April, Ms Sturgeon lobbed some red meat to SNP members on the eve of the partyrsquos conference by announcing a generic Referendums Bill, the vehicle for a second independence referendumWestminster granted the missing power, and for an Irish-style Citizens Assembly to chew Scotlandrsquos long-term problem.But it wasnrsquot enough to head off the grassroots revolt that would dominate the gathering.As the SNP leadership tried to push the partyrsquos Growth Commission through conference, activists and past and present MPs resisted Andrew Wilsonrsquos hairshirt economic blueprint for independence, with currency the focus.In a rare defeat, Ms Sturgeonrsquos plan to cling on to the pound indefinitely was replaced by the membershiprsquos demand for a new Scottish currency ldquoas soon as practicable after a Yes vote.The Unionist parties hoped it would clamp the wheels of the SNP bandwagon.But, not for the last time in , they were sorely mistaken.In May, the SNP triumphed in the European elections on a strident anti-Brexit .The party improved from two of Scotlandrsquos six MEPs to three, with the LibDems, Tories and Brexit party getting one each. Despite being in its th year of government, the SNP managed to lt its share of the vote by . per cent to .%.Even more stunning was the collapse in Scottish Labourrsquos vote. Doubly handicapped by Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard, the party lost almost two-thirds of its vote and both its MEPs to trail in fth on .%. The result screamed out for an end to Labourrsquos Brexit havering and its weak leadership, but it didnrsquot happen.The only resignation was by Labour MSP Neil Findlay, who had been in charge of the Scottish campaign, who left the partyrsquos front bench and said he wouldnrsquot stand for re-election in , citing ldquoendless internal battles.Ms Sturgeon used the aftermath of the election to announce, on a visit to Dublin, that she wanted to hold Indyref in the second half of .Logistically, the date made no sense. There would not be enough time to translate a Yes vote into independence before the  election came along.But politically, by putting a date out there, the First Minister teed up the fight she knows will fuel the  campaign.The election also led to a change in leadership for the Tories ndash two, in fact.The day after the EU vote, which she had assured the nation would never take place as the UK would be out on March , Theresa May finally croaked her resignation statement in Downing Street.Unable to get Brexit done, her fractious party had done her in instead.Her departure triggered a fateful contest to find a new Tory leader.Boris Johnsonrsquos win was never in doubt.In July, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman cancelled the opening of the new poundm Sick Childrenrsquos Hospital in Edinburgh at five daysrsquo notice after tests found inadequate ventilation systems had been installed. There were now hospital scandals at both ends of the M.In August, politicians seemed to take over the Edinburgh Fringe, with Ms Sturgeon, Ruth Davidson and John McDonnell all popping up, the latter to announce Labour would not stand in the way of Indyrefit won power.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, who had vowed to resist Indyref, was humiliated, then rapidly toed the shadow chancellorrsquos line.It was a necessary calculation by UK Labour ndash it knew it wouldnrsquot be ing many Scottish MPs and needed SNP votes to govern as a minority ndash but it proved an early gt for PM Johnson.Ms Davidson saved her grand finale for the week the festival left town.Resigning after eight years as the Scottish Toriesrsquo most successful leader, she cited the demands of a young family, but also her ldquoconflict over Brexit.As she had backed three dferent candidates against him to be leader, that was code for Mr Johnson.She used her new-found freedom to become mired in a self-inflicted row over a pound,-a-day job at a London public relations firm, leaving many to wonder how she had acquired her reputation as a ldquodferent kind of Tory in the first place.August also saw Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow go into administration after a long dispute between the yard owners and the state firm behind CalMac over a poundm order for two ferries that doubled in cost and timescale.A childrenrsquos ward at QEUH was closed to new admissions after three young patients contracted infections. The next month, Ms Freeman announced a public inquiry into the extent of building problems at the hospital and Edinburghrsquos Sick Kids.Health was now the running disgrace of the autumn. Although almost all the problems began before her time as Health Secretary, Ms Freeman faced repeated calls to resign.In November, the mother of Milly Main, who died at the Glasgow childrenrsquos hospital in September  aged , said she was % certain contaminated water was to blame.The Crown Office confirmed it was investigating the death of a three-year-old boy from around the same time. Ms Freeman put NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde into ldquospecial measures.A whistleblower revealed the board was warned of infection risks across the QEUH site before it opened in .In November, Mr Salmond appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh, where the full details of the charges against him, now slightly revised, were made public.Speaking outside, he said he would be pleading not guilty to all of them.In December, the Scottish Government faced more bad news on education, as Scotland slipped to its worst ever place in the international rankings for science and maths, though reading improved.In the dying days of the parliamentary year, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay admitted it would cost poundm more to finish the two ferries rusting at the now nationalised Ferguson Marine yard.The Government also announced it was ending the Abellio ScotRail franchise three years early because of concerns over value for money for a service that exasperated passengers.There were more delays to a poundm plan for superfast broadband. NHS waiting times for AE hit record lows. Economic growth was near stagnant.Yet Ms Sturgeon was still able to end the year on a bang thanks to the General Election. She put Indyref centre stage ndash at least at first ndash then switched to ousting Boris Johnson and stopping Brexit.She achieved neither. But the SNP harvested Labour votes and gained  seats plus a th won by an independent who will surelyto the party fold.The Scottish Tories, meanwhile, went backwards after saying the Union was on the ballot paper and urging people to use their vote to reject Indyref.But people saw through the distraction ndash a cross for the Tories meant more Boris and more Brexit, neither of which have endeared themselves to Scotland.That was their immediate concernndash Indyref will be for a later date.The most dramatic event ndash and Pyrrhic victory ndash of election night was the SNP ousting LibDemsrsquo leader Jo Swinson in East Dunbartonshire. The sight of one Remain party decapitating another must have gladdened Tory hearts no end.As in Mayrsquos European election, Scottish Labourrsquos collapse was profound.The party that won  million votes in the election of  under Gordon Brown and Iain Gray managed just half that under Mr Corbyn and Mr Leonard.Its share of the vote fell in every seat in Scotland, and it ended with .%, compared to .% in England.It is asScottish Labour supporters no longer sustain one party but have become a loose communal resource, an unlocked bank other parties can ransack for votes.Ms Sturgeon quickly used her gains to demand endless referendum powers for Holyrood. Her proposed date of later this year remains an insulting pretence, buta potent rallying cry all the same.With no sign of a turnaround in public services, a good constitutional ding-dong will be vital in keeping her airborne.However Mr Salmondrsquos trial also lies ahead.

Its interiors were redesigned by Chanel in the s when she was in a relationship with Hugh \"Bendor\" Grosvenor, the second Duke of Westminster.Despite her leaving the home more than  years ago, a number of the rooms still bear her work, including fragments of wallpaper she designed.Chanel had hand-blocked wallpaper shipped in from France, and oversaw local workmen as they put together simple fireplaces.A team of specialists who act on behalf of the Chanel Archive previously viewed the property and offered their support in giving access to all their records.A planning permission renewal application - for a hotel and five new-built guest lodges in the grounds - was lodged in  on behalf of Ghulum Choudry of the Rosehall Estate.Now, after four years on the open market, an undisclosed offer made by a family from abroad has been accepted, Malik Afsar of Remax Central estate agents said.The purchaser bought Rosehall because of planning permission that will allow it to be converted into a hotel, he added.Built in  after a fire gutted the original building, Rosehall was owned by the duke, one of the worlds richest men, during the s. The duke spent summers at the property with Chanel, his lover between  and . She decorated each room in floral and pinstriped wallcoverings that were inspired by her flat in Paris.Rosehall welcomed a host of famous faces during the s, including Winston Churchill, who stayed in  while recovering from illness.Writing to his we, Clementine, Churchill emphasised his admiration for the French fashion designer. He wrote: \"Coco is here in place of Violet [Nelson, the dukes second we]. She fishes from morn till night, and in two months has killed  salmon. She is very agreeable - really a great and strong being fit to rule a man or an Empire.\"Rosehall comes with five separate buildings and is the only home outside of Switzerland and France with interiors by Chanel. It also has what is thought to be one of the first bidets fitted in a Scottish home.It is thought that the duke and Chanel were introduced in  by Vera Bate Lombardi, a British socialite. The duke lavished gts on his lover and provided her with a home in Mayfair, London. He is thought to have been devastated when she turned down his proposal of marriage, allegedly by saying: \"There have been several duchesses of Westminster, but there is only one Chanel.\"Under plans approved in February , the Georgian mansion near Lairg would be fully restored and turned into an up-market hotel, carrying many of the design features created by Chanel.Having been neglected for more than  years, work on the project had been expected to being in early in .The property had been on the market for almost two years with an initial price tag of poundmillion."},{"url":null,"title":"dominic-cummings-calls-weirdos-apply-downing-street-jobs","story":"Mr Cummings posted an apparent job advert on Thursday saying Number  wants to hire an ldquounusual set of people with dferent skills and backgrounds to work as special advisers and potentially officials.The blog post exceeding , words came amid reports that the Prime Minister is planning ldquoseismic changes to the civil service.:Is Dominic Cummings really the most dangerous man in Europe Mr Cummings, a former Vote Leave director, said he hopes to be made ldquolargely redundant within a year by the recruitment drive.He called for officials including ldquoweirdos and misfits with odd skills, data scientists and policy experts to apply to a gmail accountthey think they fit the bill.Mr Cummings warned that there is ldquosome profound problems at the core of how the British state makes decisions and that he currently makes decisions ldquowell outside his ldquocircle of competence.And he says the need for change comes with Brexit requiring large policy and decision-making structure changes and a Government with an -strong majority having ldquolittle need to worry about short-term unpopularity.Under a subsection on hiring ldquosuper-talented weirdos, he writes that the Government needs ldquosome true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole.Mr Cummingsrsquo post came after Rachel Wolf, who helped draw up the blueprint of Tory election pledges, said civil servants could be made to take regular exams to prove they are up to their Whitehall jobs.Under ldquoseismic changes being planned by Number , she also said that civil servants are ldquowoefully unprepared for sweeping reforms that Mr Johnson is keen to push through.Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, warned that it is unclear how the new recruits would be selected or what their roles would be.ldquoCivil servants are recruited on merit, not patronage ndash a critical principlethey are to provide the best impartial advice to ministers, Mr Penman added.ldquoIt would be ironic , in an attempt to bring in radical new thinking, Cummings was to surround himself with like-minded iniduals ndash recruited for what they believe, not what they can do ndash and less able to provide the robust advice a minister may need, rather than simply the advice they want.:Andy Mciver: Dominic Cummings is a winner ndash and hell make Johnson one tooMr Penman also blamed officialsrsquo salary levels as being a restricting factor for recruiting a wider pool of talent.ldquoSimilarly, Cummingsrsquos call to world-class experts to join government may flounder on the pay rates, which are typically half of those paid where.

Politicians were treated with respect and the use of swear words was to risk being regarded as a sociopath. No matter what issues ided us what chasms of culture, class and wealth lay between us they were all forgotten when we solemnly watched the Queen on Christmas Day. These arrangements had been carefully cultivated over decades to ensure that scant opportunity was permitted for meaningful dialogue between ordinary people and those whom they touchingly believed represented their interests at Parliament.At least you knew back then that there would be an opportunity to change the Government every five years or so. This was on a strictly need-to-know basis and was controlled by the old Etonians and Oxbridge cult who ran the BBC and owned our biggest newspapers.The journalists and editors who operated the print and broadcast media on the other hand were untouchable and never held to account. What passed for scrutiny of their stories and agendasconsisted of a letters page edited by elderly and scholarly chaps nearing retirement. Thus there was room for seven or eight epistolary interventions by the dear readers, usually by those who could express themselves in the manner of a university lecturer and who could pepper their prose with droll classicisms. The people who shaped the political and cultural agenda of the UK media landscape could distort perceptions, wreck lives and destroy careers safe in the knowledge that theyrsquod never be challenged.Occasionally, a political scandal would break beyond the confines of the political and media establishment. For a while, we would all be permitted to catch a glimpse of rich and famous people behaving in the same way as the rest of us. The wonder of these came in discovering that the stratagems of the ruling elites could be blown off course by sex, drink and lies too. All too soon the show was over and an official report would soon exonerate those with the best connections and a scapegoat was offered for public excoriation.The Profumo Affair, currently being re-imagined by the BBC was one of these. The imbroglio had started three years earlier with a brief affair between John Profumo, the Defence Secretary and Christine Keeler, a struggling -year-old model. The episode was one of those which offered us an all-too-rare glimpse of power at the top of British society. While the rest of us were being told to hate the Russians and exercise restraint in our personal lives there was the government and the aristocracy cavorting with the enemy and compromising the virtue of working-class girls in the private swimming pool of the House of Astor.Once calm had been restored and the bed-sheets turned down a compliant judge was found and a whitewash report hastily constructed. The millionaire Sir John Profumo resigned and dedicated himself to charitable work before being redeemed by Margaret Thatcher two decades later. Stephen Ward, the society osteopath discovered that, without aristocratic blood, his connections amounted to little. He killed himself after being trussed up and fed to the country. Christine Keeler, a beautul woman of high intelligence and common birth struggled for the rest of her le.If the scandal had occurred in the age of social media I suspect the losers might have become winners. Ms Keelerrsquos legal fees would have been crowd-funded and Mr Ward would have found widespread sympathy. The independence of the judiciary would have been exposed as a sham and, not for the first time, intimate connections between the British elite and the nationrsquos enemies would have been revealed.As this new decade dawns messages of hope have been laced with appeals for kindness on social media. In particular, an article by the Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser has engendered debate. He has been joined by assorted political pundits who purport to desire a sense of decency in the way we engage with each other on social media. Itrsquos dficult to argue with some of this when you observe politicians being terrorised by psychopathic mobs, often within their own parties, who seek to destroy them for holding reasonable views they canrsquot stand.I also become queasy when fake academic faculties which exist to make failed politicians feel good about themselves urge us all to gentry the political environment. In the UK and across the world a war of ideas is being fought which will affect our lives profoundly. Britain is in the hands of a feckless and self-serving fop backed by a party thatrsquos been taken over by an extremist, right-wing sect. To make his hard Brexit fly he must approach the White Housersquos resident sociopath like a supplicant.A tonne of leverage will be required to sell the outcome but when you control % of the mainstream media and can rely on a BBC still dominated by Eton and Oxford to look the other way you are already halfway there. In the absence of a ing Labour Party social media provides the main source of opposition. This is no time to be worrying too much about it harbouring bad language and anger."},{"url":null,"title":"cate-devine-adult-diners-acting-like-spoilt-children","story":"Recently Irsquove been intrigued to read online comments from Scottish chefs and restaurateurs expressing their frustration at trying to satisfy the increasingly dficult demands of diners. Some of these demands stem from genuine dietary intolerances and allergies, but many appear to be based on nothing more than maddening game-playing.The chef-patron of a Michelin-starred restaurant posted that he spends more time writing menus for dietary requirementsthan for what he called ldquoreal menus. ldquoIntolerances, etc., today include: dairy, shellfish, gluten, vegetarianplus no caviar, lamb, beef, game, processed sugar, orange, grapefruit, squid, melon, cucumber, offal, egg or nuts, he wrote, adding that ldquoitrsquos always interesting to see someone non-dairy end their meal with a latte, because theyrsquove lsquoavoided dairy for most of the dayrsquo.Another post highlighted the frustration of unreasonable demands ndash and ensuing complaints. ldquoDidnrsquot get a window table . Donrsquot have Harveyrsquos Bristol cream, donrsquot do chips or omelette. Wonderthey do Tripadvisor.But intrigue has morphed into deep unease as ldquofaux intolerances and allergies have started to invade and discombobulate the eating-out scene. I was quite heartened when an Edinburgh restaurateur stepped forward to sum up the situation from her industryrsquos point of view: ldquoA lsquoveganrsquo not keen on pasta or gazpacho will have calamari, butternut risotto and chocolate cregraveme brulee. A customer who is allergic to pork products, citrus fruits, unpasteurised dairy, raw rare seafood and meat, lentils and pulses, wants calamari, venison and tarte Tatin. She added: ldquoThis is why every restaurateur in the land is on Valium or has become an alcoholic by December . They [diners] should just write their own menu. She suggested that restaurants should start demanding doctorsrsquo letters to prove that an allergy was real, and cited a prominent chef describing the situation as critical: the ldquofaux dietaries were killing the catering industry and were its biggest challenge.The online response was predictably robust ndash to the extent that she actually left Twitter for a bit to recover from the vitriol, which included being fat-shamed and accused of being in denial about being unhealthy herself. But one comment in particular caught my attention: ldquoSuppliers of anything need to adapt to what people want, not vice versa.And therersquos the rub. Itrsquos all very well to claim this, but the problem is that chefsno longer have any idea of what diners actually want from one minute to the next ndash and neither, it seems, do diners themselves. Coeliac disease and lactose intolerance, say, create real and genuine need for chefs to adapt their menus ndash and is the reason menus prominently display the letters V, GF, and so on. And I know of at least one top seafood chef who happily expanded his menu to welcome vegans, and many other chefs who have re-thought their entire menus to make them plant-heavy and meat-light for the same reason. They tell me they applaud the opportunity to be more creative with new and exciting dishes that can be safely consumed by as many customers as possible. Obviously this makes commercial as well as ideological sense.But recent evidence suggests that demands have gone beyond that to the extent that chefs are now expected to dance to the tune of spur-of-the-moment whims of diners on the night ndash without warning, and thus robbed of the chance to plan and source dishes in advance.Are people out to have a laugh at restaurantsrsquo expense just to big up the number of clicks on their online s  If so, itrsquos a deeply irresponsible practice that puts hard-won culinary reputations, careers and entire businesses at serious risk. Not to mention making a mockery of those with genuine dietary conditions. No wonder some within the industry are fighting back by outing the culprits online. This too is a risky game that restaurants would not willingly choose to play unless compelled to do so, and I applaud them for having the courage to do it.To dismiss the culprits as ldquofussy eaters is to excuse appalling behaviour. Equally, it would be too easy to conclude that such bad manners are down to ignorance of what running a restaurant entails, and that this ignorance has enabled a shocking lack of respect for the industry ndash despite the best efforts of MasterChef and other such television programmes to educate and inform. I also suspect that encouraging these people to do some research by reading a restaurantrsquos menu before booking a table would be futile.I fear that whatrsquos happening here is a deliberate disruption of the status quo. Dissing those we should most admire, just because we can, is not a good look for a nation whose culinary reputation is increasingly celebrated across the globe. Yet a wedge is being driven between the mutual sense of respect that used to be part of the collective restaurant experience by the rude arrival of an army of self-righteous iniduals whose sense of entitlement apparently knows no bounds.I can only hope that matching faux intolerances with real intolerance will put the disruptersrsquo gas at a peep ndash and keep restaurants in business for the rest of us to enjoy."},{"url":null,"title":"tribunal-rules-ethical-veganism-philosophical-belief","story":"Jordi Casamitjana said he was sacked by the League Against Cruel Sports after raising concerns that its pension fund was being invested into companies involved in animal testing.He claims he was unfairly disciplined for making this disclosure and that the decision to dismiss him was because of his philosophical belief in ethical veganism.: From veganism to Scottish independence - its time for radical actsAt the tribunal in Norwich on Friday, judge Robin Postle gave a short summary judgment, ruling that ethical veganism satisfies the tests required for it to be a philosophical belief and is therefore protected under the Equality Act .He also ruled that Mr Casamitjana, , who lives in London, adheres to the belief of ethical veganism.For a belief to be protected under the Act, it must meet a series of tests including being worthy of respect in a democratic society, not being incompatible with human dignity and not conflicting with fundamental rights of others.The ruling means that ethical vegans are entitled to protection from discrimination.Dietary vegans and ethical vegans both eat a plant-based diet, but ethical vegans also try to exclude all forms of animal exploitation including not wearing clothing made of wool or leather and not using products tested on animals.In his ruling, Judge Postle said ethical veganism was ldquoimportant and ldquoworthy of respect in a democratic society.:Veganism is touted as a solution to climate change, but is a plant based diet really the answer He said: ldquoI am satisfied overwhelmingly that ethical veganism does constitute a philosophical belief.Speaking after the ruling, Mr Casamitjana said: ldquoI am extremely happy.

Crowley bought it from a descendant of the Fraser clan in .After a fire ripped through the remains of the mansion last July ndash the second blaze to gut the property after a  fire ndash the Readdys are hoping to raise enough money to continue with renovations to the pile they hope will one day be open to the public and operated as a guest house and spiritual retreat.The new owners have established a charitable trust, the Boleskine House Foundation, and are selling salvaged stones and bags of remains to help towards the cost of renovations they estimate at around pound,.The pound eBay lot description states: ldquoYou are purchasing one original stone of up to g and one bag of charred remains from the fire on  July, , from Boleskine House.The package comes with a certicate of authenticity, with the promise that all proceeds will be used for the restoration of Boleskine House.A crowdfunding campaign was started last year and has so far generated more than pound, of the pound, target for donations.The couple hope fans of the TV phenomenon penned by Diane Gabaldon and starring Scottish actor Sam Heughan as Jamie Fraser will stump up cash to help with the rebuild.Led Zeppelin founder and guitarist Jimmy Page bought the ldquomost notorious home in the Highlands in the s and owned it for around  years. He was said to have followed in Crowleyrsquos footsteps by practicing black magic on the estate.Crowley bought the B-listed Georgian building when he was just  and lived there until . He boasted to have turned the property into ldquoa centre of black magic, evil and sorcery.He conducted black magic rituals and offered animal sacrices to satan and was said to have taken pleasure in the suffering of local people. One episode involved an employee of the estate getting drunk, after  yearsrsquo abstinence, and attempting to kill his we and children. His lodge keeper suffered the loss of a -year-old daughter, while a year later his -month-old son died.Ill-fortune seemed to continue to haunt Boleskine even after Crowleyrsquos departure. It was reported in  the then owner, Major Edward Grant, shot himself in the room Crowley once used for his satanic rituals.However, Page, who bought the property in , said in a  interview: ldquoStrange things have happened in that house which have nothing to do with Crowley. The bad vibes were already there.The rock legend claimed that the head of an executed man, thought to be Lord Lovat who fought with the English during the  uprising, could be heard rolling around the floor. The house also featured in the Led Zeppelin documentary, The Song Remains The Same.Pagersquos childhood friend, Malcolm Dent, worked as the caretaker for Boleskine before the musician sold up in the s after rarely staying there.He once claimed that ldquocurious events occurred at the house, saying: ldquoDoors would be slamming all night. Yoursquod go into a room and carpets and rugs would be piled up.The property was sold to Annette MacGillivray and her husband who lived there happily for  years before it was acquired in  by Dutch owners.Mrs Readdy told reporters in July that people were calling for the house to be razed, saying it was ldquoa den of iniquity.ldquoWe have read so many lurid details, she said. ldquoIt is an architecturally signicant building no matter who has owned it. Boleskine has such a big draw, whether people are fans of Crowley or rock rsquonrsquo roll.ldquoThe Boleskine estate is a treasure of heritage and history that must be secured for future generations. I believe it can stand as a landmark for culture, research and well-being that all can benefit from."},{"url":null,"title":"forever home for tia and sulley","story":"The Scottish SPCA is delighted to have found a loving, permanent home for a mare and her foal, Tia and Sulley.Tia was pregnant when she came into the care of the Aberdeenshire Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre in December  after her owner could no longer care for her.Sulley was born in the centre in May and it was the only home he had ever known.Tia and Sulley found their forever home with mother and daughter, Ria and Alex.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable.

No worries. I can’t even think of how I’ll start pronouncing your very dficult Irish first name. Foreigners will take time to digest the following Gaelic names: Caoimhe, Oisín, Siobhán, Niamh and a host of others. There is a historical context to this and this could just be the colonial remnants that were left in Africa as official languages! But that’s not an excuse, we must spell your names correctly and we hope you compliment migrants likewise. Udhi nade jo Belfast  . Its dholuo language spoken by people of the Luo community.

In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa. Having authored articles on migration in this past decade, it will certainly be a new environment to revisit, new faces, adults and also growing youthful population of first, second and third generation people who were either born in Africa or strongly identy with the continent because of family ties, social or legal reasons. n Elly Omondi Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the ghost of policing past visits","story":"I WRITE this column on the th anniversary of the murder of Fearghal Caraher from Cullyhanna. Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"adorable pup skye is one of many pets left at northern ireland shelters as unwanted christmas gifts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ciaran added: \"The doctors said her lungs were failing and they didnt have enough oxygen to give her. \"Her lung infection marker score has gone from a high of  to , the lowest its been in  years, which is unbelievable. \"While she was in intensive care she was on  litres of oxygen a day but now thats down to just one and shows how powerful the drug is.\" But Nicole was adamant that she did not want to be in intensive care even though she knew it was her last hope. \"Anyone I know with CF who went in there never came out again and when they brought me in I was screaming and covering my eyes because I didnt want to be there,\" she said.\"I was so scared going through the doors of ICU as I thought my le was over. \"Im so stubborn but when I saw my familys faces I just knew that I couldnt refuse my only chance to get better.\"Sitting back at home now Im so glad that I did it because otherwise I wouldnt be here.\" The rare disease Nicole picked up five years ago means she cannot avail of a lung transplant, leaving a deal between NHS chiefs and Vertex chief executive Dr Jeff Leiden as her only hope.Following a high-profile media campaign, Nicole was finally granted the lesaving drugs on compassionate grounds on December  and since then her recovery has been rapid. Ciaran and Nicole had booked to go on a three-week holiday in the sun over Christmas and while the festive period was instead spent in hospital, Ciaran says he is just relieved to have his girlfriend back in good health again. \"I cant even put into words how proud I am of her for coming through all this,\" Ciaran said. \"The drug has given her a second chance at le when she was knocking on deaths door. \"Im so glad shes here and now its the start of a new chapter for us. \"Nicole is the perfect example of why every cystic fibrosis patient must have Trikafta and we need every sufferer to have access to it because sadly she wont be the last person in this position.\" Nicole lost two stone during her six weeks in hospital and is looking forward to spending the next few weeks eating, sleeping and relaxing. \"When everyone  at this time of year is trying to lose extra pounds, I need to start putting them back on again. Its going to be a case of Netflix and chill. I bought all these new clothes before Christmas but they are hanging off me now,\" she laughs. All of Nicoles Christmas presents remain unopened but her family are planning a belated celebration with turkey and all the trimmings this weekend. While she is glad to finally be home, Nicole is also angry that she had to fight for so long to get her treatment. She is also calling for the drug to be made available to all sufferers as soon as possible. \"Im so glad I spoke up about cystic fibrosis as not a lot of people know about it, and proud that I showed people how hard it is, but thankfully Ive come out the other side better. \"But it shouldnt have been that way and I should have had Trikafta sooner.\"While Nicole now has her treatment, she has no idea how long for. \"Its on compassionate grounds and could be forever or just a month or a week,\" she said. \"I have enough medication for another month which feels so surreal but I can tell you this is nothing short of a miracle. However, its up to the drug company whether they want to keep me on it or not. \"They could pull the plug at any moment but I dare not think about it and just have to keep going. \"My aim is not to end up back in hospital for a long time except for check-ups and reviews.\"Nicole is also hugely grateful for all the care and support over recent weeks as she battled to stay alive. She added: \"Ciaran and I come from dferent religious backgrounds but Im so grateful to everyone from both sides of the community for their love, prayers and amazing support. \"Also, all the doctors and nurses who were outstanding and the extra care they give to the very sick people is out of this world.\"Les a gt and you cantit.\" The couple are now looking to  with renewed optimism after the last few weeks and hope Nicole will be well enough to attend a charity football match in aid of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust next month.

Ciaran is also focusing on ato his boxing career, which had been on hold during Nicoles illness. \"I rang my manager about arranging a fight so Ive been given a date in May in Manchester because before then I want to focus on Nicole getting better and off the oxygen for good,\" he added.

Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

The biggest loser was the DUP, with Nigel Dodds ousted by Sinn Feins John Finucane after serving as North Belfast MP for  years. The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes. The DUP suffered a third blow in North Down where the Alliance Partys Stephen Farry claimed the seat vacated by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.Nigel DoddsWhile the DUP finished the election down from  seats to eight, Sinn Fein saw their majorities slashed across Northern Ireland - Mr Finucanes win tempered by a crushing defeat for Elisha McCallion in Foyle.

An incident report from the City of Madison Police Department read: “The opossum slowly waddled off. ‘Going to be sitting in snow someplace for a long bit I bet you,’ remarked the sergeant to the officer.”"},{"url":null,"title":"drag race fan proposes in front of couples favourite drag queens","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Traffic was gridlocked as people fled and firefighters escorted convoys of evacuees as fires threatened to close roads. Navy ships were called in to pluck hundreds of people stranded on beaches. Victoria premier Daniel Andrews declared a disaster across much of the eastern part of the state, allowing the government to order evacuations in an area with as many as , permanent residents and tens of thousands more tourists. In South Australia state fire officials said the weather conditions were a cause for concern because fires were still burning or smouldering. \"The ignition sources are already there,\" Country Fire Service chief officer Mark Jones said. The early and devastating start to Australias summer wildfires has made this season the worst on record. About five million hectares of land have burned, at least  people have been killed and more than , homes have been destroyed. This week at least  homes have been destroyed on the New South Wales southern coast and dozens were also burned in Victoria. Ten deaths have been confirmed in the two states this week and Victoria authorities also say  people are missing. Fires are also burning in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. The navy evacuated hundreds of people from Mallacoota, a coastal town in Victoria cut off for days by wildfires that forced as many as , residents and tourists to take shelter on beaches. Landing craft ferried people to the HMAS Choules offshore. Smoke from the wildfires has choked air quality and turned daytime skies to near-night-time darkness in the worst-hit areas."},{"url":null,"title":"tesla aims to build 500000 vehicles per year","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sinn Fein MLA Caoimhe Archibald said: “The vandalism of election posters is a criminal offence and a clear attempt to frustrate the democratic process and upset our campaign.”Francie Brolly: “I will always show respect for other people’s opinions and views although I believe this act of vandalism was politically motivated.” South Derry mum’s plea for kidney donationA Draperstown mum told the Derry Post in April that her only hope of survival would be to receive a kidney from a live donor.In , Bronagh Murraywas given the devastating news that she required a kidney transplant just months after she received a liver transplant.The mother began a dialysis treatment but was living in hope that a live donor could be found to ‘completely transform her le.’“I had a liver transplant in March  and after that I was in a wheelchair for a year. When I did get back walking again, I had to go for blood tests and results showed that damage had been caused to the kidneys. They found out that anti-rejection tablets, which I had been taking following the liver transplant had affected my kidneys.“Tim Brown, my consultant at the City Hospital, said he has given every single person who walks through his door a chance but I’m the first patient he has made who he has hit a brick wall with,” she said.Urging people to join the Organ Donor Register, the Draperstown woman added: “A few minutes is all it takes. No one knows when they, or someone close to them, will need an organ donor, so I think it’s very important to join.” googletag.cmd.push Family of five escape arson attack at their homeA couple and their three children were lucky to escape uninjured from an arson attack on their Moneymore home in April.A car parked outside the house at Connyngham Street in the south Derry town was deliberately set alight around .am in the morning.

However, after many months recovery he is walking again with the aid of a stick.“If it wasn’t for the Air Ambulance NI, I wouldn’t be here. They were able to provide me with pre-hospital emergency care at the scene. Catherine Bell was the doctor that day and she was able to administer drugs and provide treatment that paramedics in an ordinary ambulance cannot do.”In a gesture of thanks, George later organised a tractor run through the towns in his area and the proceeds raised from it all went to help fund the Air Ambulance NI. Workers pulled off A roadworks because of security threatWorkers on the A dualling project running between Dungiven and Drumahoe were pulled off the site in April following concerns for their safety.It was believed that workers on the pound million project were told to down tools by their bosses following the alleged threat.The incident came just days after a dumper truck was burned out at one part of the site on the Killunaught Road close to Dungiven. After the workers left the site, all compounds along the route of the major construction project were locked up.A spokesperson for the PSNI told the Derry Post that police had carried out enquiries following reports that a device had been left at a site on the Foreglen Road area of Dungiven.And, Sinn Fein Councillor for the area, Sean McGlinchey said: “I would ask the people of Dungiven and surrounding areas to fully support the companies working on this project. “The people of Dungiven have been waiting over  years for this bypass and do not want further delays like this.“These workers should not be subjected to threats when going about their jobs.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He dedicated his le to fighting it. As an early leader in the Civil Rights movement, few have contributed as much to peace and equality on this island as Ivan.“Organising marches in Derry for the right to a home, to a job and the right to vote, Ivan often put himself in the path of danger to secure justice for people in the community.“On many occasions that meant he suffered vilication and violence for his convictions. Alongside his friend John Hume he helped blaze the trail that led to the Good Friday Agreement.“Ivan’s unwavering belief that people on this island should come together to fight for common ideals in their common interest remains a lesson for us all.” googletag.cmd.push Elderly couple terried by hate crime at CastledawsonAn elderly couple were left terried in July after a boulder was thrown the bedroom window of their home in broad daylight.A note, containing the names of four iniduals and a threatening message was attached to the rock used attack the pensioners home in Castledawson.Gwen and John Stewart who are both in their s were left badly shaken and unable to sleep by the incident which police treated as a sectarian hate crime.Former DUP MP for Mid Ulster, Rev William McCrea described the attack as “absolutely shocking.”It also emerged that the couple were forced to flee their home in Bellaghy  years ago also because of sectarian hatred.“This was not a child – it was someone with enough strength to hurl a boulder  foot from the front fence through a double-glazed window and then a further ten foot across a bedroom floor where it landed and cracked a wooden floor,” said Rev McCrea. googletag.cmd.push Shock following death of popular Kilrea GAC coachJuly began with the County Derry Post reporting the sad passing of well-known and popular Kilrea GAA coach Brian Calvert.Mr Calvert worked at Woodhall Education Centre in the east Derry town and was also a coach at Under  level for Padraig Pearse GAC.After news that Mr Calvert, who was in his s, filtered through tributes flowed in.SDLP MLA John Dallat described the late Mr Calvert as “inspirational.”“He was an extraordinary person in every sense, a person who had accomplished so much in his le and much of it with young people,” Mr Dallat added.And, Kilrea GAC senior coach Declan Bradley described Mr Calvert’s death as “truly heartbreaking.”“Brian radiated positivity in everything he did and that rubbed off on many of the players we coached together over the years,” he added.Kilrea GAC manager, Charlie Kielt also paid tribute to Brian Calvert.“It’s a massive loss to our club and community. He was such an energetic and positive man that had an uplting influence to all those in his company,” he said. Air pollution data goes unpublished for more than  monthsJuly  ended with the County Derry Post leading with the story that air pollution data for Dungiven had not been published for over a year.The last published data had shown the north Derry town had the highest levels of pollution in the area.The issue has blighted Dungiven for many years because of the huge volume of traffic which traverses the town’s Main Street as a route from Derry to Belfast via the Glenshane Pass.However, it emerged that the only air pollution monitor had been technically dysal and as a result pollution data was not being captured. The last known data captured prior to the discovery of the issue with the monitor was in June . Anger over offensive graffiti at Catholic church Also, in July the County Derry Post reports public anger over the scrawling of sectarian graffiti on the wall of a church in east Derry.Spray painted vandalism at St Anne’s Oratory in Kilrea laid out insults to the pope and caused outrage amongst parishioners.Sinn Fein councillor Sean Bateson hit out at those behind the vandalism.“First and foremost, this is a sectarian hate crime and those responsible should be brought to book. Parishioners and locals are incensed by this disgraceful graffiti attack on St Anne’s chapel, which is nothing more than blatant sectarian vandalism.And, local SDLP representative Helena Dallat-O’Driscoll added her voice to the condemnation of the incident.“This sacrilegious attack by three iniduals wearing very distinctive tops should allow the PSNI to make quick arrests and bring charges for criminal damage and hate crimes.“The iniduals who have done this have probably blighted their own communities with messages of hate and it would be good to have them caught. “In the meantime we will redouble our efforts to make sure this is not repeated and to ensure there is no retaliation because that would be in no one’s name and would only serve the perverted thoughts of those who did this,” she said.

I was then sent to the City Hospital in Belfast with kidney disease that can lead to kidney failure.”“Deirdre wanted to donate her kidney but I was a bit concerned that she would encounter the same issues down the line, but she was adamant that she was going to do it,” Bernie told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster a ‘black spot’ for mental health services August  began with the County Derry Post reporting that the Mid Ulster district was a ‘black spot’ for accessing mental health counselling.According to statistics uncovered by campaign group Participation and Pratice of Rightsjust five referrals for counselling were accepted in the Magherafelt and Cookstown areas from a total of ,.Elsewhere in Northern Ireland, the number treated in Ballymena and Antrim were  almost , people were successfully referred in the Larne, Carrickfergus and Newtonabbey areas.The figures related to the period between April  and March .Karen McGuigan from the Draperstown based suicide prevention organisation STEPS said she found the figures “deeply disturbing.”“We know from our own experience as a community-based counselling provider that timely access to locally based, quality counselling can be le-saving for people in distress. Our experience is validated by research which shows that counselling offers an effective, low-cost form of treatment that can help to address mental pain and distress before these become acute, thereby ensuring that fewer people end up needing crisis care services.” Over , missed hospital appointments in a yearCo Derry patients failed to turn up for hospital appointments more than , times throughout - the Derry Post revealed in August.Official figures showed that , outpatient appointments at Altnagelvin Hospital were wasted whilst  patients failed to turn up at Mid Ulster Hospital whilst  appointments at Roe Valley Hospital were also missed.NHS figures state that each missed appointment costs the service pound so almost pound, was wasted at these three medical facilities alone.

And, between April  and March , , food parcels were given out. A spokesperson for the Hope Magherafelt Foodbank told the County Derry Post: “We have found that we are feeding more families this year with benefit changes relating to Universal Credit, along with low income which both continue to be the main causes for crisis. The five-week wait for Universal Credit is just too long.” googletag.cmd.push -year-old girl makes selfless donation to help young cancer sufferersA very kind-hearted little girl from Drumsurn made a wonderful gesture in September to help seriously ill children.Brave Kellie Stephens cut-off her Rapunzel like locks to allow wigs to be made for girls her own age suffering from cancer. The school child had cm of her beautul blonde locks shorn to have the task completed.The St Matthew’s Primary School pupil decided to take the task on two years ago after she learned about the Little Princess Trust charity. Wanting to help as much as possible she told her mum that she would grow her hair and then have it cut off to help those who need it more.Kellie’s mum Martina said: “It was completely off her own bat, she just wanted to do it all herself. She is very, very brave.“About two years ago she said to me ‘mammy, I don’t want to get my hair cut anymore, because I want to give it to the children who lose their hair when they have cancer.’“To be honest I thought the notion would go off her and we never really talked about it again. Then a couple of months ago she said ‘mammy, I definitely want to do this, I’m nearly ready.’“She grew it long and it’s lovely. She’s getting it cut off right up to a tight wee bob. She might even have enough hair for two wigs.” Workers without jobs as travel giant collapsesStaff at a Co Derry branch of former travel industry giant Thomas Cook were left without jobs at the end of September when the firm collapsed. It was believed that around six workers at the Magherafelt branch of Thomas Cook were informed they were jobless after the company ceased trading.The Thomas Cook shop at Queen Street in the south Derry town had been operating for a number of years but a notice on the door said ‘This shop has been closed with immediate effect’.The note also directed customers who made travel plans through the store to a dedicated UK Civil Aviation Authoritysupport service. Loyalist victim says UFF mural is ‘hurtful and offensive’In September, the lone survivor of an Ulster Freedom Fightersattack in County Derry in the s told the Derry Post that the reappearance of a version of an infamous loyalist mural in Derry city was both “hurtful and offensive.”South Derry man Gerry McEldowney was left for dead at Castlerock in March  when a loyalist murder gang attacked him and his workmates as they arrived at a building site in the picturesque east Derry seaside town.But the re-emergence of a mural containing a skeletal figure dressed in a shabby military unorm wielding a sword in Derry’s loyalist Bonds Street area brought back dreadful memories for Mr McEldowney. The mural also contains the insignia of both the UFF and Ulster Defence Association and the words ‘Spirit of ‘’, the year in which the Castlerock attack was followed in October by the IRA bombing of the Shankill Road in Belfast but also the notorious ‘Trick or Treat’ massacre at Greysteel. Loyalist killer Torrens Knight was later jailed for his part in the killings in both atrocities in County Derry.

Whilst the overall interest in the Feis and competitor participation continues to be very strong, the crippling costs of paying for venues to stage the festival of music, song and dance is jeopardising its very existence.The senior members of Derry Feis Committee also levelled criticism at Derry City and Strabane District Council for what they said was a lack of help in sustaining the event which first took place in Easter Week .Music secretary Pat MacCafferty said: The Feis has been running at a loss of around of pound, a year and our past savings are running out fast. “Our bursaries are paid from this money. “We receive no public sponsorship of any sort, our income is from private sources.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On Sunday, Shefflin and Slaughtneil hurlers supremo Michael McShane will lead their troops into battle for the right toto GAAs Mecca later this month. While Slaughtneil have been the story of the club scene, batting on two fronts in the latter half of the decade, Ballyhale added another title in March, their seventh All-Ireland, crowning them as the undisputed Kings of club hurling. googletag.cmd.push Not since two goals from James Stephens Tadhg Dwyer in the  Kilkenny semi-final have the Shamrocks lost a championship game. They have won all  games since. After conquering Ulster for the first time, the Emmets went down to Cuala by  points. Twelve months later they had Na Piarsaigh on the ropes before losing their footing and slipping out of the All-Ireland race by seven points, despite the Limerick champions going down to  men after half-time. After their third Ulster success and a commanding performance against Dunloy in the decider, Slaughtneil are more streetwise, have developed into a better all round team and have been able to concentrate solely on the wee ball. googletag.cmd.push With the calendar moved forward, preparations needed tailored. After the celebrations died down, the black smoke was blown out of the system before it was time to get back to the grindstone. A trip for a challenge game against a Wexford select, was followed by a free-scoring clash with Antrim as McShanes side sharpened their focus. Their preparations continued with a game against Ulster junior champions Coleraine. A long-term injury to Paul McNeill has robbed McShane of one of his key defensive cogs. Especially when a glance at the Ballyhale attack has two time all-star forward Colin Fennelly outside their top five scorers, though he has been central to their ability to carve out goal chances. Its common to see him hunting down defenders in possession, something that has been the cornerstone of Kilkennys success at senior level. They will meet their match this weekend. The Emmets never lack desire. Its the balance of Ballyhales attack that provides the wow factor. TJ Reid picked up an injury in their opening round win but amassed - across the campaign. Adrian Mullen, Eoin Reid and Brian Cody need watching, while the name of Eoin Codywill also have figured when Slaughtneil formulate their match-ups. Shane McGuigan could well see himself anchoring the defence, with Karl McKaigue keeping an eye on Ballyhales goal-poacher Eoin Cody. It was the Emmets defence that excelled in their win over Dunloy, winning every inidual battle with the confidence of goalkeeper Oisin ODoherty back between the posts. The surroundings of Newry, the scene of their best performance to date, will give Slaughtneil an advantage. They are unbeaten in championship action there, following their memorable All-Ireland football semi-final win over St Vincents and emerging victorious in a war of attrition against Kilcoo. A glance at the scorelines from Ballyhales seven game path to Sundays showdown points to a generous concession rate that will have no doubt struck a chord during Slaughtneils scouting. Likewise, there will be a concern over how much they squandered in the first-half against Dunloy. A similar story on Sunday wont cut the mustard. The Shamrocks defence has a Liam McCarthy winning theme to its spine. Centre-back Michael Fennellyand full-back Joe Holdenhold Celtic crosses and the experience that brings. Mark McGuigan is likely to tuck into midfield,Gerald Bradley drops back to the sweeper role where he excelled against Dunloy. Playing with a two man half-forward line would be a cause of concern for the Derry champions. Ballyhale wing-backs Evan Shefflin and Richie Reid have chipped in with points. Shefflin also raids forward from defence and his uncle Henry may ponder the idea of pushing him up on Gerald Bradley. Reidmissed the Leinster final due to a tour of duty in Lebanon with the Irish Army but was home on leave over Christmas. He is expected to take a place in the starting line-up, with brothers TJ and Eoin. His long deliveries into their inside attacking unit is another aspect of his game. It all points towards a need for Slaughtneils attacking unit to click. Its their toughest test of the clubs history by some distance. But they have a knack of always delivering a performance. They thrive on adversity and their golden generation of slick hurlers have proven they can dine at hurlings top table. Their performance against Dunloy was billed as the best in Michael McShanes tenure. They will need the same on Sunday...and more. Verdict: Ballyhale Key Men: Slaughtneil – Shane McGuigan In their Ulster final win over Dunloy, McGuigan was a considerable presence at centre-back but still carried out a man marking job on Keelan Molloy. On Sunday, he could be tasked with picking up Ballyhale go-to man TJ Reid. McGuigan is strong in the air, is a big occasion player and his ability to create space as a footballer forward could help him hone in on Reids ghosting game. Ballyhale – TJ Reid Reid has led the way on the scoring front for Ballyhale but he has stepped into the role of puppet master since Shefflin hung up his hurl. He can surge to the wing to offer himself as a puck-out target. His frees are unerring and Slaughtneils tackling will need to be sheer perfection. However, Reid offers the Kilkenny giants so much more. He picks up ball from his defence and his vision for a pass can unlock defences.

They needed late points and replays to see off Faughanvale and Steelstown respectively. After a draw in the league, both teams were destined to reach the final and did so with little fuss. Drumsurn came back from the brink to see off Ballerin and did push Claudy in the semi-final. The final was the clash all the neutrals wanted and once they found their feet, it was Foreglen who come out on top. In Ulster, they pushed eventual winners Magheracloone to the pin of their collar but left themselves with too much to do. googletag.cmd.push  - Kieran ReillyReilly produced the save of last years championship against Loup and he repeated the feat this year.His fulling save denied Lissans Shea McKernan and he got a glove to Harry Fosters shot to turn onto the bar. Both were jaw-dropping moments that backed up his confident array of kicking.[st All-Star]  - Tiarnan WoodsThe former Derry minor captain, one of Drumsurns up and coming young guns, had a fine season.In the opening round, he was part of a defensive unit that held Slaughtmanus to just five points.Against Ballerin, it was his ability to open up his running game that offered Drumsurn an attacking threat from deep. Then, against Claudy he was superb, being edged for man of the match by Marty Donaghy.[st All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  - Cathal OHaraOnce they got over their blip in the opening round against the Vale, Foreglens defence shut up shop and Cathal OHara was at the heart of it.Despite carrying an injury, he soldiered on and was a mainstay of their run to the title. He held Aaron Kerrigan to a point from play in the final and was immense against Castledawson in the semi-final, typied by two tremendous blocks.[st All-Star]  - Niall KeenanBurst onto the scene as the Dawson won the  championship and the  player of the year was pivotal on their way back to the semi-final stage.After helping his side keep a clean sheet against Craigbane, he held both Dermot Breen and Adie Trainor scoreless against Desertmartin.Despite going out to eventual winners Foreglen, Keenan helped his side to another shut-out. It seems like he has been about forever.[rd All-Star]  - Blaine CarlinWith Claudys championship hopes on rocky ground in their round one replay against Steelstown, Carlin came to his sides rescue.An underage career as a forward gave him an eye for goal and he has been an extra attacking weapon on the wing. When he found the net twice in quick succession, Claudy reeled Steelstown in and their rescue mission was complete.[st All-Star]  - Oisin DuffyWhen Foreglen bowed out of Ulster, Ozzies tally of - epitomised his attacking game as he tried to lead his side over the line.Claudy had put Eoin McGahon on him in the county final, as a marker almost, but Duffy was still able to get forward.In the Doire Trasna game he dictated their short kick-out routine, kicked three points and pulled a brilliant save from goalkeeper Durkan. Another inspirational season. [th All-Star]  - James OKaneSally notched his only score of the championship in the semi-final win over Castledawson, but he offered Foreglen so much more.This was the season their unsung hero grabbed his portion of the limelight for an all-action performance in the county final. Two fullblocks inspired those around him and he flung himself on breaking ball after breaking ball. [st All-Star]  - Mark McCormickHe was selected twice earlier in the decade and put in a seismic sht as Foreglen title took the title.His penalty began their redemption against Faughanvale in the drawn game. He amassed - over the championship, including two equalisers during the course of the final before Foreglen eventually broke Claudys resolve.[rd All-Star]  - Daryl MullanThe battering ram, charging into opposing defences and with an eye for goal.After getting himself into the shape of his le, he helped lead a young side back to the semi-finals. Formed part of the wall across the middle that stled Ballerin and it was his point that ignited the comeback. Claudy played Drumsurn a compliment by strategically by-passing him with their kick-outs. [st All-Star]  - Eoghan DuffyHis consistent championship performances caught the eye of new Derry boss Rory Gallagher.Armed with boundless energy, he was the link between Foreglens formidable defensive unit and their talisman Kevin OConnor.He was a contender for man of the match in every game and was edged out for player of the year by Marty Donaghy.[nd All-Star]  - Marty DonaghyNugget may well have played his last game for Claudy but he had a sensational championship campaign, scoring - along the way.But he offered the Mitchels so much more. He was a constant outlet and with his trademark dummy, he was able to buy space to lead the attack.The injury he sustained in the final all but ended his hopes of a second medal.[nd All-Star] - INTERMEDIATE PLAYER OF THE YEAR  - Sean OConnorOConnor delivered when the chips were down, the man for all occasions. He was an effective half-forward but was called back into defence as their championship race heated up. After Shane Duffys injury, he kept Aidan Keenan quiet in the semi-final. In the final, he was moved back onto the rampant Oran Armstrong to help put a lid on Claudys attacking threat.[nd All-Star]  - Aaron KerriganGets the nod ahead of Oran Armstrong due to his red card in the Steelstown drawn game.Kerrigans late free earned Claudy a replay and with three goals to his name, Kerrigan pushed Kevin OConnor for top-scorer. His precise pass put his brother Shea through to win a penalty against Drumsurn which Aaron tucked to the net to put Claudy on their way to the final.[rd All-Star]  - Kevin OConnorWith - to his name, he is the top scorer all three football championships.He bagged - in their draw with Faughanvale and it was his defence-splitting pass that set-up Kevin Dunne for his goal in the replay. Handed rookie Callum McElhinney a baptism of fire in the county final and was unerring in their defeat to Magheracloone. No better man to lt the cup.[rd All-Star]  - Gary KeaneOne of the most gted forwards in the county and a real finisher.He notched - as Ballerin turned the tables on Ballymaguigan in round one and it was his inch-perfect pass that played Paul Ferris in for his goal.In the quarter-final against Drumsurn, he had the ball in the net twice in the opening half.But when Ballerins midfield were outplayed after the break, Keanes influence waned and they missed him.[rd All-Star]   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It also saw a change from the dominance of Slaughtneil and Ballinderry for most of the decade. The Emmets knocked out the Shamrocks before falling victim to Glens devastating running game in the semi-final. The Watties were unable to carry that form into the final where a Magherafelt team, while only winning by a point, were worthy winners of the John McLaughlin Cup. Away from the final, Banagher were the story that kicked the championship into le. Despite bring relegated without winning a googletag.cmd.push game, they dumped out Bellaghy and Swatragh before pushing Adrian Cushs side to the pin of their collar in the semi-final. - Daryl McDermottAfter picking up the intermediate goalkeeping spot last year and making the hurling selection, Sticks once again is honoured.He was the undisputed goalkeeper of the year. His kicking against Bellaghy was pin-point and ied. In their win over Swatragh he made two fantastic saves and Magherafelt would have been out of sight only for his brilliance. [nd All-Star]  - Conor McCluskeyWhile also a very capable baller, Clucker was Adrian Cushs go-to marker in defence.He was asked to shackle Colm McGoldrick when Darren ONeill was black-carded. He kept a lid on Peter Hagan in the semi-final while getting forward to add to their attacking arsenal. Jack Doherty and Ryan Johnston also struggled against him. Two messy Benny Heron goals, neither of them his fault, was the only blot on a perfect season. [st All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan RogersLike goalkeeper McDermott, Roger is a dual selection.In the Ballinderry game, he did a marking job on Ryan Bell yet still was able to get Slaughtneil on the attack with his trademark barnstorming runs from defence.His absence from full-back left the door open for Glen to exploit but his one man crusade almost pegged the Emmets back to nip the Watties. [th All-Star]  - Fergal DuffinGets the nod ahead of Darren ONeill and was a vital cog in Magherafelts defence.Came out on top of his battle with Ruairi Mooney and he blotted out Conor Feeney on Banaghers kick-outs. He held Kilcoos Paul Devlin scoreless from play but it was his county final performance that stands out. Two moments of bravery to win turnovers that resulted in Rossa scores.[nd All-Star]  - Gavin ONeillCharlie OKane kept Bellaghy guessing with Gavin ONeills jersey number positioning and in his new wing back role, he was immense. The fact that he nicked man of the match ahead of Conor Feeney and Tiarnan Moore spoke wonders of his performance.Swatragh didnt learn the lesson and once again ONeill bossed the game from wing-back, edging the battle with Patrick Kearney.[nd All-Star]  - Connor CarvilleWhen Glen licked their wounds after their hammering in the league by Slaughtneil, it was Connor Carville that learned the most. Following Sammy Bradley left Glen open.In the championship he was a dferent animal and when Oisin Hegarty was dismissed against Loup he was one of Glens leaders.Against Magherafelt he was one of the few to offer any help to goalkeeper Callum Mullan-Young. Glen didnt have enough like him. [st All-Star]   - Conor KearnsWith Michael McEvoy going under the kne, Magherafelts system of play needed someone to link their defence to attack. Kearns fitted the bill and thrived in his new found freedom. He handled an endless supply of ball against Coleraine and didnt look back. His goal proved to be the vital score to sink Banagher. He didnt deserve his season to end prematurely with a harsh black card against Kilcoo. [st All-Star] - SENIOR PLAYER OF THE YEAR  - Danny HeavronThe Rossa skipper once again poured out everything he had for the cause.His influence helped them see off Coleraine and his moment of quick-thinking put Kearns through for the all-important goal against Banagher. In the final he pressed high on Glens kick-outs to turn the game. Against Kilcoo he once again linked the play and was missed during a brief spell at full-forward. [st All-Star]  - Ciaran McFaulAfter Loups goal it was McFauls point that made Glen believe again. When they were staring into a defeat against Lavey, he led the way again and his display of fielding was simply awesome. Against Slaughtneil he plucked another one from the air, just when Glen needed a moment of inspiration.Not as influential in the final as was required. Without him, Glen wouldnt have got there and given three more seconds. he wouldve forced a replay. [nd All-Star]  - Christopher BradleySammy led their scoring charts in the league and it was his accuracy that edged out a well-organised Newbridge in round one. When he found the net against Ballinderry, it cemented Slaughtneils place in the last four.Against Glen, he made their attack tick and was unlucky not be their last gasp hero but Oran McGills left foot denied him a potential winning goal and a county final spot.[rd All-Star]  - Danny TallonDespite being captain, he was replaced against Loup but took it on the chin and came back stronger.Kicked a point against Lavey and plucked two vital balls from the skies as Glen dug themselves out of another hole.He gave Keelan Feeney the runaround in the semi-final. A hamstring injury shadowed his preparation for the final, but he saved his best for last and put in a performance that deserved to lt the John McLaughlin Cup.[st All-Star]  - Emmett McGuckinHis goal against Coleraine kicked off Magherafelts route to glory, as he delivered in spades.Revelling in the freedom of midfield he made his side tick and his performance in the final, along with that of Odhraacuten Lynch, ended the Rossa famine. His scores broke Glens hearts.Kilcoo had no answer to him at full-forward and he didnt deserve to be on the losing side. [st All-Star]  - Francis KearneyDaniel McKinless and Paul Gunning can count themselves unlucky to miss out.Francis Kearney carried his league form into the championship. He was in red hot formover Swatraghs two games. If the Swa had been able to get a handle on Banaghers attack, his scoring power wouldve taken them to the last four. [st All-Star]  - Alex DohertyAnother contender for player of the championship, he pinged - from play and was Glens top scorer.His goal against Lavey was sensational. After beating three men on his road to goal, he powered to the net for the goal that arguably changed Glens season. Scoring - off Karl McKaigue is no mean feat and he backed it up with four mighty points in the final. [st All-Star]  - Tiarnan MooreOne year on from tearing intermediate defences apart, Moore was at it again. His tally of -, with one assist from brother Niall, tore the Bellaghy defence asunder as he revelled in the open spaces.While he didnt score against Swatragh he pulled their defence all over the place as Banagher once again made hay.His frightening pace was one of the stories of the championship.

The Radical Bookfair is an important event which gives a great opportunity to independent booksellers and publishers due to the availability to network and create links and new important contacts. “We welcome everyone to the Radical Bookfair with dferent political visions, ideas, practices and radical traditions. “We pride ourselves in creating a space for books of local, national and international interests including social and labour history as well as themes covering radical feminism, queer liberation, anarchism, Marxism, republicanism and environmentalism. “It is also a day in which a number of campaign groups have the opportunity to table stalls so as to highlight ongoing concerns such as human rights, environmental andsocial justice issues. This year we will be continuing with a series of book launches as well as several talks throughout the event which will again add to the overall community spirit that the book fair has created within a venue such as Pilots Row. For many the event ties in well with the week-long events leading up the the annual Bloody Sunday March for Justice.”Derry Radical Bookfair takes place on Saturday,  February next, from noon until .pm at the Pilots Row Community Centre on Rossville Street. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said police had no idea where he had been or what he had been doing or how he was financing himself during that period.Defence barrister, Eoghan Devlin, said the youth could be released to his grandmothers address with stringent conditions to ensure he turned up for court.District Judge Barney McElholm asked where had the youth been during the  days and was told he had been staying at his grandmothers home.The judge said he was being asked to release the youth to an address where someone had “colluded” with him to avoid arrest.He said that was not going to happen and remanded the youth in custody until the next sitting of Derry Youth Court next month. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Facilitated by Marie Dunne, of Resilio, the event acknowledged the support provided to the Strengthening Families Programme by local professionals and illustrated the need for staff working in the community, voluntary and statutory sectors to look after their own mental health and wellbeing.The Strengthening Families Programme is an inter- nationally-proven, evidence-based family skills programme and whilst used worldwide for more than  years now it has been delivered locally since  by developing healthy communities, and is currently funded by Public Health Agency. Course delivery takes place through a team of trained facilitators drawn from a range of local agencies, who deliver parent, child and family sessions over a fourteen weeks period.For many people, raising children can be dficult unchartered territory, and it can be hard to find support. The Strengthening Families Programme helps parents identy risks that their teenagers face and help build in protective factors within the family home. The course was also designed to aid families build and strengthen their communication skills, identy and build on their strengths, family resilience and set clear rules and boundaries.Speaking at the end of the event, programme manager, Leona Bradley, said: “The Strengthening Families Programme not only provides excellent skills for families locally but also an opportunity for local agencies to work together in a unique interagency manner. “The team who help deliver Strengthening Families are not only hugely talented but their passion to improve the lives of people locally is inspiring. “Today was an opportunity to celebrate these staff and give them an opportunity to promote their own wellbeing and resilience. All too often we forget how much of themselves the community, voluntary and statutory sector workers give, particularly when working with families and young people and we are delighted to be able to give something back to them.’Praising the funders and the team of facilitators for the successful delivery of the course, she continued: ‘We would like to thank the Public Health Agency in funding this worthwhile programme and today’s event and acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the multiagency team of facilitators who successfully delivered the sessions.’This year a large-scale evaluation of the programme and its effects on local families has been commissioned by developing Healthy Communities.

He believes the EU budget will be “signicantly reduced” following the UK’s departure, which, coupled with the possible admission of other countries into the EU, will have a detrimental impact on the Republic of Ireland moving forward.The recent Westminster election results can be interpreted as giving voice to the exasperated desire of many people to see a Stormont Government up and running to try and deal with the extreme circumstances that abound in health, education and other sectors in our society. Another element has been seized upon by some in declaring that for the first time there are more Nationalist MPs than Unionist MPs elected. This disguises the more fundamental point that while some Irish republicans go into a frenzy about demographic change bringing with it the so - called inevitability of a united Ireland, they have avoided actual election results which show nothing like that outcome. In this year’s election there were first time voters who had not been born when I was first elected to Parliament in . In that Westminster election  years ago, the united Ireland parties, Sinn Fein and SDLP, obtained .% of the vote, while at last month’s Westminster election Sinn Fein, SDLP and Aontuacute got .%. Support for those parties that advocate a united Ireland is less now than it was when I was elected in . The much vaunted “demographic change” that republicans repeat ad nauseum has worsened their chances not improved them. The other more practical problem they face is that just as any pan unionist vision of an ultimate solution such as total integration within the UK wouldnt have been possible or practical whatever the majority voting for it may have been, just so any pan nationalist vision of an ultimate solution of a United Ireland would fail by the same criteria. The other big ticket item next year will be the Brexit proposition. Again, those who advocate staying in the EU through an impossible united Ireland have not been open about what lies aheadthey were to be successful. The EU budget will be signicantly reduced on an annual basis by the UKs net contributions of approximately poundbillion. Countries such as Serbia and Montenegro potentially joining in the next five or six years means the budget would become even more hard pressed let alone any fancul notion that an Independent Scotland would be re admitted pressurising those net contributing countries, such as the Irish Republic, for more money again. In short, staying in the EU in those circumstances would cost the Irish Republic much more than it is costing them now, anyone looking to join them should ponder that.  is the year we must press the new PM to give us a more equal United Kingdom as opposed to an even more expensive EU. googletag.cmd.push Gregory Campbell googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But, is the colder weather having an impact on your sleep  Are you struggling to drt off or waking up feeling chilly  If so, don’t fear. Holly Housby, sleep expert from Sealy UK, is here to help with her top tips for sleeping when it’s cold. Take a bathNot just relaxing, having a bath before bed can actually help to promote sleep and induce tiredness. Your temperature naturally dips at night as your body prepares for rest, beginning about two hours before sleep. When you soak in a hot bath, your temperature rises by a degree or two, and the rapid cool-down immediately after the bath imitates this natural decrease of your body temperature, which can help you to fall asleep faster. googletag.cmd.push Wear woolly socks, not cottonOften, poor circulation means that our feet are the first part of our body to get cold. Wearing woollen socks can help to keep you warm throughout the night - unlike cotton, wool is an great insulator and retains heat. And even better, wool has anti-bacterial properties meaning your cosy socks are odour resistant. Get movingExercising in the late-afternoon and early-evening can help to boost your body’s circulation and body temperature. However, it’s important to steer clear of exercise in the hour before bed, so as to avoid this having an impact on your sleep. googletag.cmd.push Say no to a night-capNot only does alcohol limit the amount of time you spend in REM sleep, the most restorative stage of sleep, it’s been suggested that alcohol can actually contribute to a lower body temperature. This is because alcohol causes your blood vessels to dilate, which takes blood and heat away from the core of your body. If you still want to enjoy a nightcap in the evening, make sure you only have one, and have it as early in the evening as possible to minimise its effects at bedtime. Upgrade your TOGIt goes without saying that investing in a thick, cosy duvet is important to staying warm during the winter nights. As a rule of thumb, a winter duvet should have a tog rating of . – . However, it’s also worth considering the filling.Wool-filled duvets can be quite chunky, making a good choice the cold nights. However, there are also synthetic duvets which are manufactured from fibres that are designed keep you warm while you sleep, which can be a great choice for those looking for hypo-allergenic options.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all. Rumour has it that lsquoThe Prophetrsquo was observed entering the park this morning with a bill hook and a bow saw ndash preparations must be underway for ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Boyle.jpg","title":"Boyle family celebrates as Tom marks milestone 100th birthday  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK man celebrated his th birthday before Christmas.Tom Boyle, the townrsquos former postmaster, became a centenarian on December .He was congratulated by a steady stream of relatives and well-wishers who called to the home he shares with we Maria in a low-key celebration.He is third local man to celebrate his centenary during .Felix Burns, from Rossglass, turned the big  in May, and was followed in August by Roddy Maguire from Downpatrick.All three received congratulatory card from the Queen.

However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable.

However, since then it has expanded and swallowed up its few remaining rivals to achieve almost complete dominance of the poultry processing sector in Northern Ireland.The RHI scandal revealed how some in Stormont wanted to facilitate Moy Park’s expansion by using the overly-generous payments in the Renewable Heat Incentive, something which became a de facto backdoor subsidy to the company which is now ultimately owned by Brazilian multinational JBS.The company’s complex pricing structure meant that it was very hard for those without insider knowledge of the poultry sector to understand the scale of RHI’s benefit to Moy Park, with it appearing that poultry farmers were making a fortune from the scheme rather than most of that money ultimately benefiting the company..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Among files declassied at the Public Record Office in Belfast are a series of documents which have particular resonance, given what was to follow.In September ,GLT McWhinney, head of Rural Development Division in the Department of Agriculture, sent a restricted memo to Rural Area Co-ordinators.The civil servant told them that Moy Park director Eric Reid had phoned him with a suggestion of locating a processing plant in a disadvantaged rural area.He said that the company was in the final stages of consideration of a new plant to bulk produce chicken fillets for a major international outlet.He said that it would involve  jobs and involve a cost of about £ million. The memo said: “Moy Park are looking primarily at N Ireland sites but are not restricted to locating here.”He then outlined the company’s proposal: “Can Rural Development help  Moy Park are aware of the potential within the programme to put up shell buildings through local regeneration groups which the private sector can rent and fit out.“This releases more capital for the private company and gives the ‘community’ landlord a rental income stream plus local jobs and all partners can benefit.”However, Mr McWhinney noted that working with a company as big as Moy Park “does however raise points of scale and principle”.He identied that EU State Aid law was a key question, asking: “Could a community groupengage with a major poultry company in this way to attract jobs and investment to a disadvantaged area which would not otherwise be considered a suitable location  The project per se would not increase poultry production.”Council to give £m to republican museum with Narrow Water rle Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He also asked whether the department could “engage with a specic company in this way”. And, asking a question which does not appear to even have been asked by civil servants or politicians during the engagement with Moy Park over RHI, he said: “What about other poultry firms ”He also questioned the £ million cost of the building “and that Moy Park is really not interested in anything smaller”.He said that the cost per job “appears to be reasonable and the risk element relatively low”.The following month, fellow official Liam McKibben said in a restricted memo that EU State Aid rules permitted grant assistance for poultry processing facilities but not for slaughtering or production of chickens.He said that it would be “prudent” to take the view of Whitehall’s agriculture department and the European Commission before committing to paying a grant.He said that “almost certainlywe are to go down the road you outlined this will create a precedent for other approaches both from the poultry sub-sector and the food processing sector in general”.He added: “The availability of such funds could be used to underpin direct and indirect Government support for the industry.”The files show that at the same time, Moy Park was in discussions with ROSAabout a processing factory in Jonesborough while also in talks with the IDB about locating the plant at Granville in Dungannon — essentially getting two arms of government to compete over how much subsidy it would receive.A document said that in a conversation with Janett Liggett from the Department of Agriculture, Mr C Jordan from Moy Park “admitted that in local public relations Moy Park does not enjoy a good reputation and companies like Tesco would be keen for their supplier to take a more pro-active role in the community”.At the time, the company had told government that it “wishes to expand on-farm poultry production” and that it had “developed a sophisticated contractual arrangement with producing farmers”.try catch  TrendingYoung man found collapsed in NI woodland on January  has been identied say PSNI -

Red meat also attracted a huge amount of unfair and unsubstantiated criticism from a range of ill-informed commentators and self interest groups..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “Despite this backdrop, the UK red meat industry and its levy bodies made good progress in  in telling the true and positive story about our livestock and meat industry’s sustainability, contribution to climate change mitigation and its ability to help feed a growing global population’s demand for dietary protein.”“Looking to the main areas in the world where demand is growing it is encouraging that Chinese and UK authorities agreed a protocol in  for UK beef exports to China and our industry looks forward to servicing this important market in  and beyond.“As an organisation which provides services to beef and sheep farmers and processors LMC is acutely aware of the importance of the beef and lamb industry to the Northern Ireland economy, rural society and the countryside which we all enjoy.”The Commission’s chief executive confirmed that  is a milestone year when big decisions will be taken by UK Government around the future relationship of the UK with the EU, future UK trade policy with countries outside the EU and the future shape and funding of domestic agriculture policy in the UK. He continued: “Ideally we will have local Executive Ministers from Northern Ireland who can play an active role in influencing those policies and reflecting the economic and societal interests of Northern Ireland to Westminster decision makers.”Concluding, Mr Stevenson said: “LMC will continue to educate our young people in Northern Ireland schools on the importance of including beef and lamb in the diet. We will also promote the quality, versatility and values of Northern Ireland farm quality assured beef and lamb at home and abroad. “All stakeholders with an interest in the UK agri-food industry must work more collaboratively and strategically than perhaps they have ever done in the pastthe post-Brexit era is to be one that works successfully for our industry and delivers positive outcomes for society.”Meanwhile Farmers for Actionhas welcomed the new year with calls for Stormont to get back up and running. Such a development, it is believed, will make it easier to secure the introduction of guaranteed farmgate prices in Northern Ireland. These would cover the cost of production incurred by farmers but would also include an additional margin, which would put production agriculture on a more sustainable footing. According to FFA, these prices would be reviewed on a quarterly basis.The organisation is also calling for a halt to beef imports from countries like Brazil. This assertion is based on the claim that the UK and the rest of Europe are self sufficient in beef while beef produced in countries like Brazil has an excessive Carbon Footprint.Council to give £m to republican museum with Narrow Water rle Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Turning to Brexit, FFA officebearers believe that the creation of a trade border down the Irish Sea would be ‘obstructive’ and represents a ‘political failure’ on the part of the UK government.An FFA spokesperson said: “It is certain to give those exporting and importing goods to and from GB and the EU additional transport and custom clearance expense.”try catch  TrendingYoung man found collapsed in NI woodland on January  has been identied say PSNI -

It only became compulsory for front seat passengers in the early s, and in rear seat passengers around the time I began to drive.Rapidly the UK moved from a culture in which most people in cars were not restrained into one in which almost everyone wore a belt..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Deaths and injuries were reduced radically.The other huge change that I notice since then is adherence to  mph speed limits.I remember well the casual way in which these limits were ignored, albeit with occasional moments when police patrols would be found at the edge of such a  mph zone.Drivers routinely sailed into a  mph zone travelling at mph or even  mph.I recall the sense of bewilderment that the wide Newtownards Road outside Stormont had such a limit, when a  mph or  mph limit seemed more appropriate.Now, like most other drivers, I am well used to travelling at exactly  mph along that stretch and it seems a reasonable speed.In the late s and the s, around  people died each year on average on Northern Ireland’s roads. Traffic levels have risen by a multiple of more than . since then, which means that such a fatality rate applied to current traffic levels would result in perhaps  deaths in Northern Ireland each year.Last year there were  deaths, the joint second safest year since records began in .The average number of deaths over the last decade has averaged only .A spate of tragic deaths in recent days shows that, as the authorities keep telling us, one death is one too many.But we should not make that point so forcefully that we lose sight of the stunning — simply stunning — progress that there has been in making our roads far safer.Ben Lowry: A conversation about Northern Ireland with Professor Brendan O’Leary Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"At least  people are alive each year who would otherwise be deadwe had not made such strides in safety.As well as greater adherence to speed limits and seat belt laws, there are many other reasons for the decline,Motorists are better trained, better aware of the risksand better aware of the penalties for drinking or killing someone.Cars are much better built and have to be maintained to a safer standard . Roads are better designed and have better markings.Even so, I can think of several measures that could help to drive deaths down closer towards zero.• Dashboard cameras within cars. They are already used to keep down insurance premiums of young folk, butthat was expanded, fewer and fewer people would dare to drive badly.• A  mph speed limit in streets with housing. The  mph limit is too high on such residential roads. Some years ago I was discussing this with an old school friend and we both agreed that  was too high for streets with lots of parked cars. We were travelling at well below  and put our theory to the test and began to increase our speed up towards the  limit and then stopped before reaching it, because it was obviously too fast with cars on either side. Yet lots of drivers still tear down such roads at that speed or higher.• Greater use of average speed cameras in  mph zones. Elderly relatives of mine live within such a zone and I often see cars seeming to roar past but in fact they might only be doing  or  mph. It is still too fast and so the limit needs greater enforcement.• A mph limit in rural roads. The current speed limit on single carriageway roads, denoted by the national speed limit sign in the picture on this page, is mph. This is far too high for most rural lanes and even for most B roads. • A mph limit on major single carriageway roads or a mph limit on the best of them, but onlythey have a  sign or  sign, to show that they are exempted from the lower  mph national speed limit. Also, far greater construction of overtaking lanes on major single carriageways so that motorists do not get struck behind tractors and tempted to overtake against oncoming traffic• A mph limit on dual carriageways that have deadly gap junctions in the central reservation, enforced by average speed cameras. The current A road in Co Down would have such a  limit until it is upgraded and the gap junctions removed .• A mph limt on dual carriageways that have flyover junctions . This would be enforced by average speed cameras.• An mph limit on motorways. This would be to let motorists know that it is not all puritanism, and that drivers would be allowed to go a good pace on our safest roads. It too would be enforced by average speed cameras so that  means , not . It would further be enforced by cameras to ensure motorists keep their distance between vehicles in front, and do not sit in the overtaking lane.• No new planning permission whatsoever granted for entries directly on A roads. And any existing entrances on to A roads that can be moved to adjoining lanes would be transferred to the quieter, safer road.Under my plan there would, in summary, be a lot more average speed cameras, which would become cheaper with technology advancements. Average speed cameras remove even the temptation to speed, because they cannot be evaded by suddenly slowing down for a fixed site camera, then speeding up again. But under the plan there would also be many more roads with mph limits , and some roads with higher limits still — the motorways. So there would be plenty of scope for travelling swtly when it is safe to do so.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: A conversation with Professor Brendan O’Leary©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a -

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.
