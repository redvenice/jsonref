(Picture Getty)Fifty-six million years ago, the Earth warmed far above the temperatures we experience today – and ice at the poles melted.It sounds like the kind of crackpot conspiracy to be found on ‘ancient alien’ UFO sites, but scientists have seriously investigated the idea.Professor Adam Frank of the University of Rochester writes in The Atlantic that the investigation could offer insight into how to find alien life – or about our impact on our planet.Frank writes, ‘There is a conundrum here. If an earlier species’s industrial activity is short-lived, we might not be able to easily see it.‘The PETM’s spikes mostly show us the Earth’s timescales for responding to whatever caused it, not necessarily the timescale of the cause.Could we be one of several civilisations to have lived on Earth? (Picture Getty)‘So it might take both dedicated and novel detection methods to find evidence of a truly short-lived event in ancient sediments. In other words, if you’re not explicitly looking for it, you might not see it.’Frank says the researchers thought about what our civilisation might leave behind in rocks for future civilisations to find – plastics in the ocean, evidence of fertiliser use, and (most of all) evidence of fossil fuel use.Frank says that civilisations might – through their collapse – trigger the conditions to create more fossil fuels, for future civilisations to use.Frank says, ‘Our work also opened up the speculative possibility that some planets might have fossil-fuel-driven cycles of civilization building and collapse. If a civilization uses fossil fuels, the climate change they trigger can lead to a large decrease in ocean oxygen levels.Russia sends \u0027reinforcement\u0027 of warships loaded with tanks to Syria‘These low oxygen levels (called ocean anoxia) help trigger the conditions needed for making fossil fuels like oil and coal in the first place. In this way, a civilization and its demise might sow the seed for new civilizations in the future.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7629819.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"britain get mini heatwave week 26c sunshine","story":"People relax in on the beach in Brighton (Picture: AFP)We’re going to have glorious sunshine this week, with temperatures expected to hit 26C.That means Brits will have an early chance to get out their shorts, sandals and sunglasses, with the country set to experience an unusually high climate for this time of the year.But the highest temperatures of 26C should hit in the south east on Thursday, with the weather expected to be warm and dry in many places.MORE: Was there another civilisation on Earth before humans?

The ceiling had rotted out above my bunk bed, which meant the drainage from a bathtub was leaking onto me. I survived on power bars that my dad would send me, he\u0027d smuggle them into me through the lining of a case, which was stuffed with them.\u0027I had to constantly clean asbestos and pipes damaged in the boiler room, situated in the tunnels underneath the LA headquarters. There were three boilers the size of two-story houses, then five or six smaller ones, all completely wrapped in asbestos. I was only 16 years old and working on eight-inch steel pipes, welding thousands of yards of steel pipes at that age, it was absurdly dangerous.\u0027After one year at RPF in LA, I got transferred to finish off at Flag. I was remodeling a lot of the hotel rooms, but then was handpicked to make all the specialty furniture for Cruise\u0027s penthouse.\u0027To this day, Cruise, 55, still has his own suite on the top-floor of the Scientology-owned Osceola Inn, which is dedicated to his own personal taste.Tighe says: \u0027On every other floor at the Osceola, there were seven or eight hotel rooms, but he had the whole floor. It was British colonial style. There were two four-poster beds, all African mahogany, hand made plantation-style shutters 8ft tall.           At 12 years old Tighe (pictured in 2005) signed a billion-year contract with the Sea Org and endured 18-hour days of hard labor and studying  Brendan was punished and sent to the Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) - a Scientology prison - and forced to do hard labor           After one year at RPF in LA, Tighe was transferred to finish off at Flag and then was handpicked to make all the specialty furniture for Cruise\u0027s penthouse (pictured) \u0027Built-in, custom-made, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, two giant 8ft by 12ft wide entertainment systems and bead-board ceilings. They\u0027d also put up special satellite dishes for his TV. The penthouse had triple the amount of cameras than anywhere else, often disguised as smoke alarms.\u0027After Tighe had finished RPF in 2002, he was approached by the deputy security chief who gave him a position at The Sandcastle, a Church-owned hotel mostly used by public Scientologists, who were visiting Clearwater HQ for courses and auditing, and Scientology VIPs.The Sandcastle security control room, where Brendan worked, monitored most areas where Scientology VIPs studied and lived, including Travolta and Cruise\u0027s personal quarters. From 2004, Brendan became the head of security at The Sandcastle until he left five years later.The Top Gun actor would often stay for months at a time, along with his huge entourage, and complete the \u0027Operating Thetan Levels\u0027, the highest of Church studies.\u0027I wasn\u0027t his personal bodyguard, that was a guy called Algar, but for seven years in a row, I was doing his security detail, such as guarding him when he walked down the street and would be checking all the cameras in his living area. I was a top priority with the dentist, I always had to have my teeth whitened and regular check ups. You had to have a good smile for Tom Cruise,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027Five of us were ordered to get gun licenses out of 47 security, we\u0027d have a gun strapped to our legs, it was specifically for Cruise and Miscavige. It was amped up when the protester group called Anonymous started in the early 2000s.\u0027In all those years, I think he said hi to me three times, even though I\u0027d be in the hotel every single day. When you see him glad-handing everyone in videos, he never did that at Flag, he kept to himself. Even if he was on a course with 200 people, he\u0027d have a three-person security buffer from anyone.           Brendan doing security at an International Association of Scientology Gala circa 2007          Sea Org Day in 2005           Flag Building, the global headquarters for Scientology in Clearwater, Florida\u0027You\u0027d hear that he would travel to obscure Scientology Orgs and shake their hands, but it\u0027s just photo occasions, he\u0027s not like that. He had to have everything private, every detail. I found that odd.\u0027His routine would be - wake up, gym for an hour, then breakfast of all kinds of \u0027shakes, lots of food and protein, all sent to his room by his personal chef, who was one of my close friends called Nico. He just liked bacon and eggs and protein shakes. Then he\u0027d gym again before the day is out. When he would go to exercise, he would want the entire gym wing all to himself.\u0027He\u0027d then go to study, including auditing sessions and refresher courses, he\u0027d be constantly in the classroom. Cruise was a perfectionist and would hang around for several weeks even after being allowed to go, as he wanted more auditing, more courses.\u0027It was beneath Cruise to have his own hotel card, so we had to make sure that he could go through all these doors and they would open and close perfectly. There\u0027s hundreds of doors, with magnetic locks and punch codes. If it took him 30 seconds to go down a hallway, no one else was allowed to use it, same with any public areas and even the urinals. If anything was out of place, like someone had pissed on the floor, Cruise would tell the security. Sometimes it would get back to Miscavige, then someone would really be in trouble.\u0027He had his own private jet so he could go in and out without anyone seeing, Miscavige also got granted use of it. We\u0027d know weeks, if not months, in advance if he was coming, he never just popped in for a day or two.\u0027There were times where he\u0027d have to do movie reshoots during his coursework, but he\u0027d be straight back, or they\u0027d even do it locally very secretly, where directors and producers would meet him at Flag. All his movies fitted around Scientology. The only person he did have time for is Miscavige, and the pair would ride around Clearwater on their motorbikes or go to the movies.           Brendan had befriended Cruise\u0027s mother Mary Lee, who converted in the mid 2000s           While working as the PR officer for a fundraising unit he invited Mary Lee to an awards banquet. Above is her thank you letter to Tighe          Invitation to Brendan to start the Operating Thetan Level 2 - there are eight levels in Scientology, which followers study and it costs a lot of money\u0027When I witnessed it for the first time, I thought I was going to have a heart attack, they were putting on their motorbike gear on a public street, in full view of everyone. They\u0027d then drive to the movies, which they\u0027d do a lot, I don\u0027t know how no one ever noticed them. They\u0027d then ride back, talk for an hour by the road, then go their separate ways,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027Cruise emulates Miscavige in every way.\u0027But it was his relationship with children Isabella and Connor which stuck with Tighe. Nothing got in the way of his studies, family was second to Scientology, The kids would even stay in different lodgings.\u0027Although he was at the Osceola, he\u0027d rent a few rooms at The Sandcastle for his staff, Isabella and Connor, and their teachers and caretakers. I never, ever saw him with his kids apart from one time in 2007 when it was his birthday on the 4th of July. I don\u0027t want to paint a bleak picture, but I was watching hundreds of cameras and I never saw them with him. They\u0027d even be making faces into the cameras.\u0027 \u0027They would be taken to amusement parks, do schooling in their hotel rooms. I heard staff talk about how they constantly had to make sure that the kids were on Cruise\u0027s side. By the mid-2000s, Cruise, who came from a strict Catholic upbringing in Louisville, Kentucky, had converted his mother Mary Lee to Scientology, and his three sisters - Cass, Marian and Lee Ann - they were all working for him in some capacity.          Cruise is the only one with a \u0027direct line\u0027 to leader David Miscavige (pictured), Tighe claims \u0027Cruise\u0027s mom was always there at Flag, she was a lovely woman, we would talk for hours sometimes, she was so nice. His mom always remembered my name. I would feel safer talking to her when Cruise wasn\u0027t in town, I wouldn\u0027t want to get caught by him. \u0027She was getting lots and lots of auditing and was very happy about it, she was so proud of her son, she was the sweetest woman in the world. My take on it was that he was still a mommy\u0027s boy, but his sisters were under his thumb.\u0027After I left security in 2009, I was the PR officer for a fundraising unit and organized an awards banquet and show. Mary Lee was personally invited by me and sent me a thank you letter.\u0027The two-sided letter said: \u0027Beings of this universe, The entertainment was great, the food was great, the table decor was great could have danced all night. Much love, Mary Lee South.\u0027Yet Tighe tells a different story about his sisters and Cruise\u0027s attitude to them. \u0027He wanted all his sisters and their children at the same super high level as him, being super dedicated Scientologists and not dragging him down in anyway. \u0027They would work for him either in management or housekeeping, but, in talking to his family, it was always about making him happy.\u0027Nothing was left to chance with Cruise and when he orced from Nicole Kidman in 2001, it was leader Miscavige\u0027s chief aim to find him a girlfriend.          Tighe said he had met church member Kirstie Alley several times. He also claims to have helped Kelly Preston get a birthday gift for TravoltaTighe would also accidentally get the reports on Cruise\u0027s latest brainwaves, who would then make handler Davis fire off a note to Miscavige. In a Scientology promo video from 2008, Cruise was interviewed about what the Church means to him, and he\u0027s seen laughing on camera. The clip went viral and Tighe says Cruise wanted the clip played continuously on Scientology TV, which he wanted created just for him.\u0027Tommy would get slapped around for the littlest thing that Cruise was not happy about. Tommy was the buffer between Cruise and Miscavige, Miscavige would never directly deny any Cruise\u0027s requests, but usually they\u0027d go through Tommy, who\u0027d then have to handle it delicately,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027For example, after he got the Freedom Medal, in one of the reports, it said that Cruise wanted to create a TV network on Scientology. He was so pumped up about his medal that he wanted them to create a video of the ceremony, then play it 247 on some new channel he wanted. \u0027He wanted the full interview, the one where he\u0027s laughing his a** off, on the TV network, he thought it was the best thing ever. Tommy had the worst task of having to tell him we couldn\u0027t do it.\u0027When Cruise eventually settled down with Dawsons Creek actress Katie Holmes, 39, and they had a daughter Suri, now 11, security proved even more difficult. \u0027Cruise and Katie would be super competitive, they\u0027d race down opposing stairwells to get to the gym, silly things like that to see who could run there faster.\u0027Scientology and him was always first, without a doubt.\u0027Katie was always nicer to us than Cruise. Cruise never said: Hey, I know you work hard behind the scenes for us. Just never happened. Whenever she was there, she\u0027d get giant amounts of Cold Stone ice cream for us, she wanted to make sure all the staff got something behind the scenes.

San Francisco does have a 420 code, but it refers to ‘juvenile disturbance’, a tenuous connection at best. The California penal code does have a 420 section, but it refers to the unlawful prevention or obstruction of a person from entering public land.As for the births and deaths of musical luminaries: Bob Marley died on May 11 Joplin died in October Morrison in July Hendrix in September. Even the chemical composition for cannabis is out, coming in at 483 known compounds.          There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/17/4B1D5D9200000578-0-image-a-15_1523636424387.jpg","title":"Adorable polar bear cub goes swim walk outdoors born Germany","story":"    This is the adorable moment a polar bear cub goes for her first wander outdoors with her mother and takes a leisurely swim          Little Nanook made her first steps outside today beside her 13-year-old mother, Lara, as they travelled out of their cave for the first time since the tot was born          The polar bear cub was seen inspecting her enclosure and discovering new wonders as she enjoyed her first outing  Nanook was born on December 4 last year at the zoo (pictured) in Gelsenkirchen, western Germany, alongside two siblings who died within two days          The 18-week-old bear now weighs around 22 kilograms and fans across the nation came to see the little one in her enclosure.

It was the same doctor but a markedly different response and then I was admitted straight away.\u0027I spent that night in ITU, three months in hospital and then I left with what I call a \u0027weight loss programme\u0027 - I had my leg amputed above the knee within the week.\u0027Despite the seriousness of his condition, he said the initial knock to his leg, which may have caused the eventual sepsis, brought him no cause for concern.He said: \u0027It was just a bang. People were coming towards me and I took a step to the right and banged myself into the barrier. It\u0027s one of those things that happens every day.\u0027Mr McCarthy said he can\u0027t be entirely certain it was the knock which caused his sepsis, but that the rash he quickly developed was in the same spot and he\u0027s \u0027fairly certain\u0027 it caused his illness.          Despite the seriousness of his condition, he said the initial knock to his leg, which may have caused the eventual sepsis, brought him no cause for concernHe says he wasn\u0027t aware of what had happened to him or how seriously ill he\u0027d become, adding: \u0027I was out for the count - I didn\u0027t know anything about it. It was my family. Everyone was travelling round from Liverpool and the doctor said \u0027we think it\u0027s sepsis\u0027 and they had to sit there and go through all that.\u0027A priest came to read the last rites and my mother was in bits.\u0027When he left the hospital, John said he was grateful to be alive and saw himself as \u0027the boy who lived\u0027 - but that it wasn\u0027t just physical changes he had to come to terms with.The Sepsis Trust, who helped John after his illness, are the first ever official charity partners of the Grand National - and will be at the festival offering life-saving tips on how to spot sepsis.Important medical information from the charity will feature in racecards, on trackside screens and in numerous locations around the site.Mc McCarthy said he decided to share his story and represent the charity at Aintree because he doesn\u0027t want anyone else to go through what he went through - or for another family to experience what his did."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/15/14/13AA4C5C000005DC-5617799-Two_Russian_frigates_and_an_anti_submarine_aircraft_are_also_sai-a-2_1523799499391.jpg","title":"Royal Navy submarine hunted Russia cat mouse pursuit","story":"    A Royal Navy submarine has been hunted by Russian warships in a \u0027cat and mouse\u0027 pursuit under the Mediterranean.

It was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missilesBarzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack. A total of 76 missiles pummeled this site alone. Smoke still lingered well after the attack that happened in the early morning darkness of 4amA Russian motion in the UN Security Council to condemn the airstrikes was rejected with only China and Bolivia joining Russia to vote in favour, as U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley promised the country was ready for another strike if Assad crossed the chemical weapons \u0027red line\u0027 in the future.Moscow\u0027s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said: \u0027A pre-designed scenario is being implemented.

Today on the Andrew Marr show (pictured) he called for a \u0027war powers\u0027 lawThe Pentagon shared details early on Saturday of the successful, coordinated missile attack on Damascus which set the Syrian regime\u0027s chemical weapons program back \u0027years\u0027. At a press conference in Washington DC on Saturday morning, Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie gave a detailed break-down of the 105 missiles launched, saying: \u0027This is going to set the program back for years. We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.\u0027He also rejected the Syrian media\u0027s claim that Assad\u0027s missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over. Russia also claimed missiles had been intercepted. The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Center which was considered to be the \u0027heart\u0027 of the regime\u0027s chemical weapons program. The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by  22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles.  The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities.  On Saturday, the General said that if any deaths are reported they may well have been the result of Assad\u0027s counter fire. \u0027Syria shot 40 large missiles into the air using ballistic trajectory, without guidance. When we shoot iron into the air without guidance, it\u0027s going to come down somewhere,\u0027 he said. All of the US aircraft returned safely to base after the attack. Gen. McKenzie did not say where the Lancer B-1 Bombers had flown from but other officials suggested they were deployed from an airbase in Qatar.       A Syrian soldier films the damage at the site of the Barzah Scientific Research Center in Damascus on Saturday morning after it was annihilated by 76 missiles            Smoke was still billowing from the site on Saturday morning, hours after the 4am air and sea missile attack             Soldiers were putting out the flames and smoke on Saturday morning as US officials celebrated the attack and said \u0027mission accomplished\u0027 \u0027We met our objective. We hit our target. It was mission accomplished,\u0027 a Pentagon spokesperson said on Saturday, repeating President Trump\u0027s tweet earlier in the day.Hours after Trump hailed the missile strike targeting the Syria\u0027s suspected chemical weapons - tweeting, \u0027Mission Accomplished!\u0027 - Vice President Mike Pence defended the president while building support among U.S. allies for the joint strikes with Britain and France on Saturday.\u0027The objective of the mission the commander in chief gave our military forces and our allies was completely accomplished - with swift professionalism,\u0027 Pence told reporters, noting there were \u0027no reported civilian casualties.\u0027He also had a warning for Russia: \u0027Our message to Russia is, \u0027you\u0027re on the wrong side of history,\u0027 \u0027 Pence also said. \u0027It\u0027s time for Russia to get the message President Trump delivered last night. \u0027You\u0027re known by the company you keep.\u0027Russia has military forces, including air defences, in several areas of Syria to support President Assad in his long war against anti-government rebels.Confusion arose over the extent to which Washington warned Moscow in advance. The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, \u0027Before we took action, the United States communicated with\u0027 Russia to \u0027reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.\u0027A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, hours before the Western missile strikes. Woman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseSinger Azealia Banks in tears as she says she was rapedShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyFootage shows aftermath of fatal car crash in Stoke-On-TrentParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Diane Abbott: Russia\u0027s a greater threat to world peace than USUS Marshals arrest prison escapee after 37 years on the runFather overcome with emotion by his son\u0027s photo album giftRussia: Trace of Western-made nerve agent seen in UK samplesDoes this CCTV capture \u0027janitor\u0027 ghost throwing a broom?

Fifty-seven of those were Tomahawk missiles and 19 were Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles.The Tomahawks were mostly fired from the USS Monterey, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser and the USS Higgins, USS Laboon and the USS John Warner submarine. France deployed its Mirage and Dassault Rafale jets and reportedly used four frigate warships. It is not clear how many aircraft were deployed. Britain is believed only to have fired missiles from its Torpedoes and Typhoon aircraft. Other ships from each nation\u0027s military were in the region, including the USS Donald Cook, but did not fire any weapons. Despite the attack, Pentagon spokesperson Dana White said the US was still committed to a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the ongoing civil war in Syria.\u0027Our goal has not changed. Our goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS....but Assad\u0027s actions were beyond the pale. We do not seek conflict in Syria but we cannot allow such grievous violations of international law,\u0027 she said. \u0027We will not stand by passively while Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, ignores international law.\u0027Iran condemned the Western strikes on Syria, saying no country has a right to take punitive measures against another \u0027beyond international procedures.\u0027The semi-official Fars news agency quoted Iran\u0027s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as saying that Iran had warned about the possibility that \u0027terrorist groups\u0027 were behind the alleged chemical attack that triggered the strikes. It said he communicated his concerns in a phone call with Boris Johnson on Sunday.Diane Abbott: Russia\u0027s a greater threat to world peace than USWoman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseSinger Azealia Banks in tears as she says she was rapedUS Marshals arrest prison escapee after 37 years on the runFather overcome with emotion by his son\u0027s photo album giftRussia: Trace of Western-made nerve agent seen in UK samplesDoes this CCTV capture \u0027janitor\u0027 ghost throwing a broom?Shocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyFootage shows aftermath of fatal car crash in Stoke-On-TrentParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13  Trump vows to sanction MORE airstrikes against Syria if Assad dares to use chemical weapons again, as Nikki Haley tells UN Security Council members they have FAILED miserably to tackle his evil regimePresident Trump has vowed to carry out further airstrikes on Syria if the regime dares to use chemical weapons again, as Nikki Haley lashed out at Russia during a fiery meeting of the UN Security Council.Scores of fast jets, fighters and destroyers fired more than 100 missiles at three military targets in Syria on Friday night in retaliation for President Assad\u0027s chemical weapons attack on the rebel enclave of Douma on April 7.While President Trump greeted the end of the attacks with a tweet saying \u0027mission accomplished\u0027, Ambassador Haley promised the US was ready for another strike if Assad crossed the chemical weapons \u0027red line\u0027 in the future.\u0027The time for talk ended last night,\u0027 Haley told an emergency meeting of the Security Council called by Russia. \u0027We are prepared to sustain this pressure, if the Syrian regime is foolish enough to test our will.

Bush addressed sailors aboard a Navy ship in May 2003 alongside a \u0027Mission Accomplished\u0027 banner, just weeks before it became apparent that Iraqis had organized an insurgency that tied down U.S. forces for years. Russia proposed a motion at the Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the airstrikes, but this was rejected with only Russia, China and Bolivia voting in favour.   Diane Abbott: Russia\u0027s a greater threat to world peace than USWoman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyFootage shows aftermath of fatal car crash in Stoke-On-TrentParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Singer Azealia Banks in tears as she says she was rapedUS Marshals arrest prison escapee after 37 years on the runFather overcome with emotion by his son\u0027s photo album giftRussia: Trace of Western-made nerve agent seen in UK samplesDoes this CCTV capture \u0027janitor\u0027 ghost throwing a broom?

Jeremy Corbyn insisted he would never countenance military action without a UN resolution - even though Russia has the power to veto themSpeaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show, Mr Corbyn said: \u0027I think what we need in this country is something more robust like a War Powers Act so that governments do get held to account by Parliament for what they do in our name.\u0027 The Labour leader warned of an escalation in a \u0027proxy war\u0027 between the US and Russia. He said chlorine has been used by \u0027a number of parties in the conflict\u0027 in Syria as a weapon. Mr Corbyn said that if Britain wants to \u0027get the moral high ground around the world\u0027 it must abide by international law for taking military action. He said the humanitarian grounds used by the UK to justify strikes was \u0027debatable\u0027.               The Labour leader also made clear he does not accept that the strikes on Syria by the UK, US and France were legally justified on humanitarian grounds\u0027Where is the legal basis for this?\u0027 he said.  Asked if there were any circumstances in which he would back air strikes in Syria, Mr Corbyn replied: \u0027I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it. \u0027If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire.

But he failed to call UK Prime Minister Theresa May in the early stages of the operation, giving the French leader the opportunity to claim France is America\u0027s leading ally in Europe.  Vladimir Putin condemned Friday\u0027s strikes as an \u0027act of aggression\u0027 that will worsen the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria and have a \u0027destructive influence on the entire system of international relations.But Trump has vowed to carry out more if Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime dares to use chemical weapons again.

Mrs May will face MPs tomorrow. Asked if there were any circumstances in which he would back air strikes in Syria, the Labour leader replied: \u0027I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it.\u0027If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. \u0027That surely would save a lot of lives,\u0027 he told the Andrew Marr Show.  The second site outside of Homs was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons  Bunker. It was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missilesSome 75 people, including children, are said to have died when the Syrian regime used chlorine gas and another nerve agent in Douma last Saturday.Aid workers told how chlorine could be smelled in the air and victims were found with foam in their mouth and with burning eyes.Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter\u0027s Square that he is `\u0027deeply disturbed\u0027 by the international community\u0027s failure to come up with a common response to the crisis in Syria and other parts of the world.\u0027Despite the tools available to the international community, it is difficult to agree on a common action toward peace in Syria or other regions of the world,\u0027 the Pope told a crowd of 30,000 after his traditional Sunday blessing. Assad continues to deny using any chemical weapons, telling visiting Russian politicians today that Western air strikes against his country were accompanied by a campaign of \u0027lies\u0027 and misinformation at the UN. But in response to the deaths, scores of fast jets, fighters and destroyers fired more than 100 missiles at three military targets in Syria on Friday night.The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Centre which was considered to be the \u0027heart\u0027 of the regime\u0027s chemical weapons program.The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by 22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles. The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities. Barzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack.

Gen. Kenneth McKenzie gave a detailed break-down of the 105 missiles launched, saying: \u0027This is going to set the program back for years. We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.\u0027He also rejected the Syrian media\u0027s claim that Assad\u0027s missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over.

The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, \u0027Before we took action, the United States communicated with\u0027 Russia to \u0027reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.\u0027A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown.

Fifty-seven of those were Tomahawk missiles and 19 were Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles.The Tomahawks were mostly fired from the USS Monterey, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser and the USS Higgins, USS Laboon and the USS John Warner submarine. France deployed its Mirage and Dassault Rafale jets and reportedly used four frigate warships. It is not clear how many aircraft were deployed. Britain is believed only to have fired missiles from its Torpedoes and Typhoon aircraft. Other ships from each nation\u0027s military were in the region, including the USS Donald Cook, but did not fire any weapons. Despite the attack, White said the US was still committed to a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the ongoing civil war in Syria.\u0027Our goal has not changed.

One amendment could make the UK remain in the EU customs union. This would make it impossible to agree trade deals around the world.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, an architect of the Leave victory, dismissed Sir Patrick’s remarks, saying the UK would ‘boldly go’ into areas of the world it has neglected.When Andrew Marr suggested on his BBC1 show yesterday that British trade negotiators might be confronted by ‘alien spacecraft waiting to zap us’ in these far-flung places, the Foreign Secretary assured him that they were ‘friendly, wonderful places where we can renew old friendships, rebuild relationships and develop fantastic new free-trade deals’.In any case, Brexiteers have little to fear from the intrepid Captain Picard.

It made him reckless. He got into a silly alcoholic argument at a party and burst out: \u0027I\u0027m a member of the Communist Party — have been for years!\u0027This wasn\u0027t even true. He\u0027d never been a party member, not even in his radical Left-wing days at Cambridge.

When he heard of this outburst, he could see that his comrade\u0027s days were drastically numbered, and he contacted Moscow for instructions on how to get him out.He then briefed his fellow spy and Cambridge recruit, Guy Burgess, to warn Maclean that he was going to be rumbled any day, and to set up an escape plan.Meanwhile, the spy-catchers were getting closer as they eliminated other suspects. To the incredulity of George Carey-Foster, head of Foreign Office security, the spotlight was shifting to Maclean.Carey-Foster found it hard to believe that such a trusted friend and colleague could really be the guilty party, yet the evidence increasingly pointed to him. An appalled Foreign Office had to accept that Maclean — the brilliant man many of them had expected to run the show as Permanent Secretary one day, the star they had hitched themselves to and protected, had to be Homer.          In May 1951, Maclean left the house (pictured) on SurreyKent border and travelled to France with fellow spy Guy Burgess before defecting to the Soviet UnionThey were paralysed with indecision about how precisely to bring him in. They were also too embarrassed to name Maclean, one of their own, to the Americans.The only action agreed at this point was to put a tap on his phone and a tail on his movements. His mother\u0027s phone was also tapped, as was the one in the consulting room of the psychoanalyst he was seeing about his alcoholism.But a decision was made to hold off actually doing anything more until either concrete evidence could be obtained that would hold up in court or the suspect could be interrogated and confess. During this window of official inactivity, the most senior spy ever detected inside the British government was, amazingly, allowed to go about his business unhindered.He lunched with old friends in the respectable establishment surroundings of the Garrick, Army and Navy and Travellers clubs. He had tea in the office. And, all the while, the watchers from MI5\u0027s surveillance unit, A4, loitered on street corners and silently followed him.Maclean himself must have suspected his nemesis was getting closer. Sensitive files were being kept from him his superiors seemed awkward around him there was the echo of the tap on his telephone.Clearly, he was worried. An old acquaintance he ran into thought him shabby and morose, \u0027untalkative, with his hands thrust deep into his tweed coat pockets and his shoulders hunched\u0027. He seemed defeated, exhausted by the worlds which he had strived to straddle for so long.Elsewhere in London, Burgess was in crisis talks with Anthony Blunt, another highly placed Cambridge alumnus working for the Soviet Union, who was embedded in MI5.          Kim Philby, the wily undercover master-spy who had recruited Maclean as a Soviet agent, briefed his fellow spy and Cambridge recruit, Guy Burgess (pictured), to warn Maclean that he was going to be rumbled any day, and to set up an escape planBlunt passed a message to Moscow that if Maclean was arrested and questioned, he would almost certainly blab, putting the whole network in danger.So far, Moscow had hesitated about getting Maclean out: now the instruction came back: \u0027We agree to your organising Maclean\u0027s defection. We will receive him here.\u0027Burgess met Maclean for a drink at the Reform Club, where he told him that MI5 were onto to him. Maclean wasn\u0027t surprised. \u0027I\u0027m being followed by the dicks,\u0027 he said, pointing out two men in the street jingling their coins in a policeman-like manner. \u0027I\u0027m expecting a summons any day.\u0027But he was reluctant to defect, abandoning his wife Melinda and his family, especially since she was pregnant. The word came back from Moscow: he had no choice.Philby then sent a coded message telling them there was no time to lose. Get on with it.For the next few days, Maclean found it in himself to act normally. He renewed his railway season ticket and left his trousers at the dry-cleaner\u0027s for collection.In terms of escape plans, it helped that the watchers from MI5 chose not to follow him in the evenings or at weekends. Their presence in the Home Counties village where he lived would be too obvious. They saw him off from Victoria each night, then headed home.From Moscow came a new order: that Burgess, increasingly a liability because of his own excessive behaviour, would not only help Maclean to \u0027exfiltrate\u0027 but go with him for at least some of the way.The problem was how to get the two of them out, given that it was a safe bet the airports and ports would be watched. Moscow toyed with \u0027that classic spy-novel device, a submarine appearing at a discreet rendezvous somewhere along the coast\u0027, but time was too short.          Donald Maclean with his wife Melinda Marling and his two sons Ronald and Fergus in the 50sIt was Blunt who came up with the solution. There were cruise ships that left the Channel ports on a Friday night, then put in for brief stops for meals and shopping in France and the Channel Islands before returning on Sunday evening. As passengers were deemed not really ever to leave Britain, passport checks were virtually non-existent.Thursday, May 24, was another frantic day at the top of the Foreign Office, with furtive high-level meetings that ended in still more dithering about Maclean\u0027s guilt. They were still very cautious about condemning such a trusted colleague — and there was also the political consideration that managing how they broke the news to their opposite numbers in America was crucial.Not to tell them would be a breach of their intelligence-sharing protocols but nor did they want the story, which would be a sensation, to leak.A timetable was drawn up to put off his interrogation for a month, partly to give them time to deal with their opposite numbers in the U.S., and partly because Melinda was due to give birth on June 17, enabling them to search their house, if necessary, while she was in the nursing home.The next day — Maclean\u0027s 38th birthday — he went to work as usual and rang his mother to invite her for lunch. She had a previous engagement, she told him, and couldn\u0027t make it. She was never to see him again.He lunched with old friends instead — champagne and oysters at Wheelers in Soho — but was \u0027steady on his feet\u0027, according to the watcher tailing him when he went through the Foreign Office doors for the last time at 3pm.As he left that evening, he told colleagues he wouldn\u0027t be in for a few days because \u0027something has cropped up\u0027 . That left Sir Roger Makins, the deputy under-secretary, suspicious. He was in the know about Maclean and rang the head of security to alert him.But there was no reply and, running late for a social engagement, he concluded that, as Maclean was under surveillance by the Security Service, there was no need to raise the alarm.No one in the Foreign Office had been told the surveillance teams knocked off when Maclean took his train home. The team\u0027s last sighting of him was recorded as \u0027after a drink, he boarded the 6.10 pm train for the Whitsun Bank Holiday\u0027.And, officially, that was the last that was ever seen of him.At home that evening, the family dined on a special ham Melinda had spent the day preparing, and birthday cake. To Melinda\u0027s annoyance, a man she did not know arrived, introduced as \u0027Roger Styles\u0027. It was Guy Burgess.Dinner was a chatty, \u0027normal\u0027 meal, with no one showing any sign of strain. Afterwards, Maclean went upstairs and packed a double-handled Gladstone bag because, he told her, the two of them had to go away on business. He might be away a night or two.

The government announced last month that it was giving a further £100million to councils to help repair potholes and protect local roads from severe weather (stock image)The Association said £1million would be spent per mile on strategic road networks such as motorways from 2015-20 - compared to just £21,000 a mile for local roads.There are also concerns that deteriorating rural roads will make access for the emergency services harder and response times longer - potentially putting lives at risk.Predominantly rural areas have a fire and rescue service incident response times of 10 minutes 37 seconds compared to seven minutes 43 seconds in urban areas.Jeremy Atkins, an NFU Mutual senior agent in Devon, told Farmers Weekly that rural roads were the \u0027arteries of the countryside\u0027 and it would have serious implications if they became unusable.\u0027Other rural road users such as cyclists and horse riders are also at risk,\u0027 he said.\u0027They may need to take sudden avoiding action when they encounter a pothole or may ride, unsuspecting, into deep potholes which are filled with rainwater.\u0027The government announced last month that it was giving a further £100million to councils to help repair potholes and protect local roads from severe weather.Transport secretary Chris Grayling said the money would help repair almost 2m potholes as well as help protect the roads from any future severe weather.This was on top of £75million in government funding already given to councils from the Pothole Action Fund this year, as well as an extra £46m or highways authorities announced before Christmas.Mr Grayling said: \u0027We have seen an unusually prolonged spell of freezing weather, which has caused damage to our local roads.\u0027We are giving councils even more funding to help repair their roads so all road users can enjoy their journeys without having to dodge potholes.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/16/08/4B34E53300000578-5619333-image-a-1_1523863295189.jpg","title":"UK WEATHER Britain bask hottest April day 10 years week","story":"    The sun rises across the River Thames at Gravesend in Kent this morning to mark the start of a week of high temperatures           A map showing the African plume that is moving across Britain this week          Another view across the Thames at Gravesend this morning.

They fled to safety through an upstairs passageway leading to their newsagents shop in Waterfoot, Lancashire.The couple, who are President and President Elect of Rossendale Rotary Club, later discovered their employee Hitchin was behind the fire after he was spotted on CCTV.Hitchin, of Newchurch, had been telling fellow villagers he \u0027hated\u0027 the Watts after they were obliged to declare his cash in hand payment to benefits officials.He was jailed for three and a half years after he admitted arson being reckless as to whether life would be endangered at Burnley Crown Court.          Hitchins tried to torch the home of Adrian Watts and his wife Caroline after developing a grudge against them following the benefits cutIn a statement to police Mr Watts, a grandfather who has run the newsagents store since 1985 said: \u0027One of the most upsetting details was finding out Neil was telling people in the local community how much he hated us. It has taken us four weeks to get our house back to a liveable state and we are exhausted.\u0027There have been some nights where I have dreamt of being trapped in a burning building. \u0027Had they not had smoke alarms then the outcome could have been a whole lot worse.

He did a good job, he worked seven days a week and we increased his wage when he had to pay tax.\u0027We did everything we could for him. At the time I would never have said it was Neil, I didn\u0027t think that he had that sort of spite in him.\u0027You just can\u0027t compute how somebody could do that to you. We used to get on really well. I was just incredulous and disbelieving. But the fact is he had a grudge while he was still working for us. If we hadn\u0027t had a smoke alarm we wouldn\u0027t be here now.\u0027  The couple who were targeted said they couldn\u0027t believe Hitchin had become so consumed by the pay issue. Left: Victims Adrian and Caroline Watts and his wife. Right: Mr WattsThe court heard Hitchin had been employed by Mr Watts for five years, delivering newspapers in the area. He was paid cash in hand for his work.Prosecutor Richard Archer said: \u0027At the same time was claiming benefits and did not declare this. Mr and Mrs Watts properly declared the money they paid their staff through the books and the job centre became aware of his employment. He was interviewed about this and as a result his benefits were reduced.\u0027He continued to work there but felt aggrieved. He spoke to a friend of his and told him of plans to fire bomb the job centre - but commented that he would need to cover his face as there was CCTV. After a while he switched his intentions to the newsagents as he blamed the Watts for his change in circumstances.\u0027This was more a personal vendetta than a commercial one. He didn\u0027t target the newsagents but the house next door where the Watts were sleeping.\u0027          Hitchin had been delivering papers for the newsagents for five years before the arson attackHitchin had a previous 2006 conviction for harassment. His lawyer Anthony Stephenson said in mitigation: \u0027A clear diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome has been given in this regard. What compounds the circumstances in this case is that this is a man who had formed an almost siege mentality.\u0027He is remorseful and regretful. He never intended to harm but just to scare or frighten. He had formed an incorrect view of his part-time employers and thought they were dead set against him. When he was in drink and at a low ebb he committed the offence for which he stands here today.Sentencing Hitchin, Judge Jonathan Gibson told him: \u0027There was a significant risk of harm because you put accelerator through the letterbox late at night. If the smoke alarm wasn\u0027t working the consequences could have been a lot more severe.\u0027Luckily they managed to get out of the house via a back stair case. There was significant psychological harm when they reflected on what happened. You do have a previous conviction which shows an obsessive type of behaviour.\u0027This offence was committed in drink and was an attack as a result of ill-feeling and more than one person was endangered.Hitchin was also made subject of a lifetime restraining order banning him from contacting Mr and Mrs Watts. He also must not go within 500m of their house or shop unless to pass by on the main road in a moving vehicle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c02746dbd9a44a09092c470944c4ee0476d3f7f0/0_272_6557_3935/master/6557.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e54ad4a2cb0d91f78ba9f1ad3824a510 2600w","title":"shed the size of town what britains giant distribution centres tell us about modern life","story":"When you click on a product, something, somewhere, moves. The item is shifted off its shelf by human or robot and on to a chain of delivery mechanisms that takes it to your door. That item, and millions others like it, plus the machinery that handles them, needs space. The more we shop online, the more such space is needed.You’ll know all this, I expect, but you may only be dimly aware of the physical consequences: very big boxes, getting bigger and more numerous. Higher, too, as robotic distribution systems allow goods to be piled further from the ground than before.These boxes are of such importance that some are classed as “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, which means that national government rather than local authorities give them planning permission. Some are shrouded in secrecy. They are where the virtual becomes physical, with a vengeance. Their scale challenges the conventions of town and country planning, pushing their designers and creators to find more or less convincing ways to respond.Imagine the space that is used to store and display a product in a traditional shop, and then imagine great dollops of it sucked from almost every high street and supermarket in the land to a centralised facility. Add it to the long-established need for physical shops to warehouse their goods. You end up with something like Dirft – the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal – near Rugby, or the Magna Parks in Milton Keynes and Lutterworth: town-sized agglomerations, containing thousands of workers, made up of very big sheds. They are called distribution centres, which differ from what used to be called warehouses in the degree to which the buildings are integrated into logistical networks of trucks, trains, the internet and subsidiary distribution points.The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas argues that the modern countryside is now ided into two types: on the one hand industrialised agriculture with the big structures that serve it, on the other landscapes preserved for their picturesque beauty. Dirft confirms his point. It stands close to the pretty Northamptonshire village of Crick, with its medieval church of St Margaret’s (Grade I listed, notable Romanesque font), also to the pleasant rolling countryside of Warwickshire (Shakespeare’s county, as the sign on the border says). Dirft itself consists of colossal distribution centres from which retailers dispatch their produce, via the nearby M1, across the country. Here is an abstracted high street of the nation in which the buyable contents of a home – food, furnishings, hardware, clothes – are translated into vast labelled containers: Tesco, Sainsburys, Bathstore, Halfords.The Dirft development’s origins lie in the mid-90s, when a freight rail connection was established, via Felixstowe docks and the then new Channel tunnel, into something called the Trans-European Transport Network. As the area had already been designated, in 1978, as a “motorway orientated growth point” the addition of the railport made it exceptionally fertile ground for the bumper crops of big sheds that then started to blossom there. There are now more than 6m sq ft of building with another 7.7m on the way.Dirft is no prettier than its name and doesn’t claim to be so. It is a landscape of those mute boxes and of the roads, loading areas and parking zones they need to sustain them, the earth vigorously reshaped to make the flat platforms on which they stand. It is made of fences, berms and security gates, of young trees in their protective tubes and gnarled old ones, survivors of the site’s former rural life. A pitched-roofed Ibis hotel adds a note of forlorn domesticity. Wind turbines turn.You couldn’t call it country or town: it is a node, a zone. It approaches a sort of sublime, you could say, in which the vast whiteish rectangles resemble conceptual art and the engineered terrain unwittingly becomes land art. Its scale is that of the national and international networks of which it is part, not the locality.The complex is surprisingly uncontentious, given its size and impact, among the local community. “It is positive”, says Josie Flavell of Crick parish council “in that a number of residents are employed by the many companies at Dirft.” She is pleased that Prologis, the company that owns the site, contributes towards two police community support officers, organises litter removal, pays for cycling and pedestrian routes and financed a heritage board to be placed at the site of the old Kilsby and Crick railway.Simon Bowers, of Daventry district council, also likes the jobs it brings. “It’s a valued part of the local economy,” he says. “It’s an appropriate development that does no real harm.”But, in a country where land is as constrained as in Britain, where it is a struggle to find space for other such essentials as new housing, the growth of big sheds is particularly hard to accommodate. If it is a fast-moving business, wherein a building 10 times the volume of St Paul’s Cathedral might go up in six months, it might take a decade to assemble a site out of former farmland, and win planning permission for it. In Lutterworth there is a campaign group called Magna Park Is Big Enough, which in January persuaded the local council to refuse, by a margin of two votes, a planned expansion. One meeting of the group was held in a hangar to accommodate the number of protesters.There is, therefore, a motivation to “innovate in a mindful and respectful way”, as Gazeley, owner of the Magna Parks, put it. Last year Creative Review magazine spotted a trend, a “new breed of superstructures trying very hard to disappear”. Off the M5, for example, near Bridgwater in Somerset, a huge Morrisons distribution centre is clad in long horizontal strips of varying shades of green, the better to blend with the lush West Country landscape. Magna Park in Milton Keynes, home to John Lewis, Waitrose and River Island, a mile-plus-long, 4m sq ft array, is uniformly banded with gradations of blue, from dark at the bottom to pale at the top. The intention is that it will fade into the sky.It depends on the location, explains Tim Ward of Chetwoods, the architects of the Milton Keynes Magna Park and a number of other distribution centres. If the structures are generally viewed with landscape behind, green works well if sky, blue is better. There is, he says, some art to the choice of tones that includes a knowledge of the latest developments in the technology of colour.Chetwoods are keen to stress that they don’t want the structures to disappear, exactly – a futile task, given the enormous size of the buildings – but rather to be less intrusive. Indeed, you are conscious of Magna Park Milton Keynes from miles around – an insistent, astounding, blueish presence that occupies the horizon from end to end, an alternative atmospheric that keeps reappearing down country lanes, from new housing estates and across fields. Or, if you are driving along the M1, it is an azure-cerulean abstraction, flipping past the edge of vision for an appreciable interval of time.The striking thing about it is less the breaking-up of its bulk than the consistency of the pattern across such an expanse of surface. There may never before have been so much synthetic blueness in one place.Colour, in any case, only gets you so far. Gazeley like to talk of the million trees they have planted at Lutterworth to create a publicly accessible “Magna Wood” and “the wildlife-rich Mere Lane Lagoon fishing lake.” At Milton Keynes a pond captures and attenuates the rainwater that falls on the development’s expanses of roof. There are swans, moorhens and many species of tree. There is a “bee hotel”. There is an uplifting, if artistically dubious, statue of the Olympic long jumper Greg Rutherford on the roundabout at the entrance to the complex. As befits the home of Waitrose, Magna Park has a palpable quality and coherence in its layout, but even blunt Dirft has measures to buffer its impact with landscape.Gazeley are particularly proud of Altitude, a new distribution centre on their Milton Keynes site that is not only an unusually high 21 metres but also has a roof ready to be covered by photovoltaic cells, at such time as they become economically viable. The health and wellbeing of employees will be supported by such things as good lighting and ventilation and reindeer moss growing on living walls inside the building. New technology is reducing the number of jobs in the business, I’m told, but many of those that remain are becoming more skilled, which means that companies have to try harder to attract good\u0026nbspstaff.Laurie Chetwood of Chetwoods says that distribution centres, which are among the most single-minded of building types, must now acquire a “duality of purpose”, which means things such as making running tracks out of the fire engine lanes that surround the boxes. He talks of cladding that can double as batteries to store solar energy gathered on the roof. One day, maybe, it might be possible to charge electric trucks with it, which would mitigate the rather obvious ecological drawbacks of dispatching thousands of HGVs across the country every day.Simple as they may look, distribution centres are sophisticated structures. The machinery that moves stuff around is constantly evolving. Their playing field-sized floors have to be exceptionally level, as small unevenness could cause the high fork-lift trucks they use to lean unacceptably at the top. Years of competition have made their structure as spare and economical as can be. Architects such as Chetwoods have to reconcile all this with the wishes of users (who might want something tailored to their needs) and of investors, who will want a structure to be adaptable to future users.It is tempting to say that these buildings make the internet visible, except that their visibility is strictly limited. Sometimes they get into the news when reporters, posing as warehouse workers, bring news of working conditions inside. You can get a glimmer on Google, for example from employee reviews of Primark’s warehouse, which sits like an acropolis on a raised earthwork in Northamptonshire: “they’re treating a people like nothing,” says one in imperfect English “they beautiful lied on induction how much they cares about worker, don’t believe them.” The buildings, however, remain notably blank,\u0026nbspgiving almost no clue of their busy inner lives.Some users and owners are dismissive of press inquiries to a degree unusual in big, public relations-conscious companies. Tesco refused a request to see inside their Dirft base, which was possibly not surprising, but also to answer simple questions, such as: what are its dimensions?For the writer Carolyn Steel, whose book Hungry City: How Food Shapes Our Lives examines the relationship of society to food, this secrecy is the antithesis of the more public processes by which food once progressed from field to market to kitchen to plate. “The exchange of food used to bring people together,” she says. “Now the process is designed to exclude the human”. But distribution centres manifest the world we have chosen and had chosen for us, in return for efficiency and convenience, in which a product appears in the home by ever more inscrutable magic.Their scale and growth are a consequence of the fact that all that physicality and volume\u0026nbspthat the virtual world displaces has to go somewhere. It’s welcome that architects and developers should try to make something of them and to mitigate their impact with woods, ponds and indeed coloured bands. But, short of a dramatic restructuring of the economic, technical and social basis of the modern world, these uncompromising building types will only become more essential to our lives. The contrast between\u0026nbspwhat was previously thought of as natural and urban landscape will only become\u0026nbspmore stark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64ed79f8e87c5a5e32b76c40cd936f743679d6ae/0_62_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=91a6ffe8f98ed751c92362f3cb4b7e7a 1240w","title":"daniel kalder picks five books about dictators","story":"Stalin’s claustrophobic life at the Kremlin, Mussolini’s failed campaign against Mickey Mouse, and how Jean-Paul Sartre became one of Mao’s ‘useful idiots’Although Stalin was for decades the supreme leader of the largest country on Earth, he saw little of his empire, rarely venturing beyond the walls of the Kremlin.

The results are surprising: I did not know that a quarter of Italy’s Jewish population were members of the National Fascist Party by the 1930s, nor that Topolino (Mickey Mouse) was regarded as a corrupting influence on Italian youth. And yet Mussolini’s own children read comics starring the American rodent even in Il Duce’s own household, his political experiment was a failure.Stalin’s World is very dense and Mussolini’s Italy is very long – common characteristics of books about dictatorships. Simon Leys’ Chinese Shadows has just over 200 elegantly written pages, and yet cuts to the heart of Mao’s Cultural Revolution with precision. Leys exposed the destructive evil of Mao’s regime at a time when “useful idiots” ranging from Jean-Paul Sartre to Shirley MacLaine were singing its praises in the west. His narrative fuses insights from his own travels in China with profound but lightly worn erudition. One moment Leys is discussing Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse‑tung, the next he is reaching back to its 14th‑century precursor, the Ming Ta kao.Latin America has endured many tyrants, spawning the genre of the dictator novel. Of all the celebrated examples of the form, I am most fascinated by Augusto Roa Bastos’s I, the Supreme. The 1974 novel provides a fictionalised account of the 19th- century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco, AKA Dr Francia, AKA “the Supreme”, who ruled the nation between 1814 and 1840. The Paraguayan author’s interest in the Supreme was not purely historical Bastos wrote the novel while Paraguay was suffering under another dictator, Alfredo Stroessner Matiauda. However, the book is no simple allegory, it is also a profound meditation on power and language.And now for something completely different: Riad Sattouf’s The Arab of the Future. We know personality cults are strange, but that strangeness looks different from the perspective of a child. Sattouf experienced both Gaddafi’s Libya and Hafez al-Assad’s Syria while still a small boy. Kids don’t spend a lot of time reflecting on totalitarianism, but they do form strong impressions. His simple depictions of living in an almost-abandoned building for expatriates in Libya, or of watching Assad praying on TV are the kind of banal micro-details that would lose their significance in written prose. Captured in the panels of a cartoon strip, however, they attain a luminous resonance that lingers long after you’ve finished the book.• Dictator Literature: A History of Despots Through Their Writing by Daniel Kalder is published by Oneworld in the UK and is available in the US as The Infernal Library: On Dictators, the Books They Wrote, and Other Catastrophes of Literacy (Henry Holt)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50df0731d04f515399dca70138e0ed94ba458f78/22_74_1998_1198/master/1998.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=888923474efca65b406214ea7dde4638 1240w","title":"jd wetherspoon closes all social media accounts","story":"Chair Tim Martin reportedly made decision after publicity over trolling of some MPsJD Wetherspoon is closing down all its social media accounts in a move that has been met with widespread scepticism.The pub chain’s decision was reportedly in response to the trolling of some MPs, but many commentators suspected it was a publicity stunt by the chairman, Tim Martin. The company said it was closing down the Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts for its 900 outlets. In a statement announced in a tweet that is no longer available, Martin said: “We are going against conventional wisdom that these platforms are a vital component of a successful business. I don’t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers.”Martin added: “It’s becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion. We will still be as vocal as ever through our Wetherspoon News magazine, as well as keeping the press updated at all times.”Martin is said to have taken the decision following recent publicity over the use of social media to criticise MPs and others, especially those from religious or ethnic minorities. However, the chain has failed to attract much of a following online, with just 44,000 followers on Twitter and 100,000 on Facebook. Much of its activity on social media has been devoted to fending off complaints. Once, it took five years to reply to a Twitter complaint about slow service.Martin’s statement said customers could use the Wetherspoon website and app to contact the company, or speak to pub managers.Media commentators predicted the move would backfire. The chain has also been targeted by pro-Europeans for its support of Brexit – Martin was a significant backer of the Vote Leave campaign – with calls from some to boycott its pubs. The company has often had to deal with hoax statements posted on social media. In November last year, the company was forced to refute a claim that staff had been banned from wearing Remembrance Day poppies while at work.Many of its 900 pubs have Facebook pages with fewer than 1,000 likes, meaning that anything they post is unlikely to be seen by users in their news feed. They are, however, still a magnet for bad reviews, which Facebook displays prominently.One pub, which has an overall star rating of 3.7, still has a review section headed “People talk about terrible service”, and both reviews on display are one-star complaints. The company’s corporate HQ location page on Facebook has also attracted one-star reviews, including one in which a customer claims her lost glasses were retrieved from a bin.The company has confirmed that no jobs will be affected by the move."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8f016de6ba8ba60c0a76d8b9b6e99dda152866/0_137_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a86e687f2bb5b706c973ffc405488d9d 1240w","title":"uk retailers see 6 drop in shopper numbers in march","story":"Dismal weather kept consumers away from the high street last month, prompting the steepest drop in shopper numbers since the end of 2010.“The severe weather put paid to any glimmer of hope for an uplift in shopper activity in March,” said Diane Wehrle, a director at Springboard, which compiled the footfall data. “A proportion of this was made up over Easter, with footfall in shopping centres and retail parks rising from last Easter. but this was more than offset by the impact of the heavy rain on high streets.” The drop was particularly marked as this year’s chilly March was set against balmy conditions a year ago when temperatures rivalled holiday hotspots such as Mallorca and Ibiza. But Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa, which accounts for £1 in every £3 spent in the UK, said the bad weather did not entirely explain the lacklustre spending in March.“We are in the midst of a dip in consumer confidence and this – coupled with other economic factors – is causing shoppers to continue to restrain themselves,” Antipof said. “High street sales suffered once again however, it is also noteworthy that e-commerce spend fell for the first time in 10 months, and by its fastest rate since 2012.”The difficult conditions will pile pressure on retailers already suffering from rising costs and consumers’ caution in the face of food price inflation and a squeeze on their spare cash.Big names including Toys R Us and Bargain Booze owner Conviviality have fallen into administration, while New Look and Carpetright are closing dozens of stores in order to restructure.

Although closed since 1988, the pool was not empty. Squatters had moved in, and held raves in the old pool tank – much to the annoyance of campaigners, who had cleaned it up for community events. The tour was to introduce locals to a bold new redevelopment plan for the lido: to reopen the pool, install a cafe and evict the squatters.As the locals were shown around, the squatters sat in front of the changing rooms, where purple buddleia had begun to grow above the doors, and watched them. One woman on the tour, meanwhile, enquired whether she would have to swim if she wanted a coffee. It was a moment that seemed to capture the extremes of life in Hackney: young homeless people facing eviction, and an affluent new resident who saw an opportunity for a latte.Campaigners, however, remember the 18 years spent trying to resurrect it. When the pool closed for refurbishment last year, it stayed closed for four months longer than expected, causing locals to anxiously recall the fate of Haggerston Baths a mile away. The grade-II listed building closed in 2000. Despite a 16-year battle, it did not reopen: an unhappy ending for local campaigners.Indeed, you could write an alternative history of Hackney through the story of its pools. As well as London Fields and Haggerston Baths there was the catastrophe of Clissold Leisure Centre, which cost £45m –nearly seven times the original budget – and closed in 2003 for four years following a flood, just 18 months after it had opened. There is also the furore over Britannia Leisure Centre, which despite a £300,000 facelift in 2016 is to be demolished as part of a major redevelopment that will include a leisure centre with three swimming pools, a school and 480 new homes – only 80 of which will be classed as affordable. Victoria Park was once home to the largest modern lido in London. It was demolished in 1990 to make way for a car park.The closure of pools has been disastrous for Hackney schoolchildren. In 2006, a feasibility study on Haggerston Baths found that four out of the five secondary schools surveyed did not provide any form of swimming, due to lack of funding or facilities. At one point in the mid-noughties there was only one swimming pool with lanes to serve a population of more than 200,000.In the last decade-and-a-half, the gap has grown more visible, as Hackney has become one of the hippest destinations in London, with its chic restaurants, boutiques and cafes. On a hot summer weekend, there are so many people in the park that it looks as if there’s a festival underway. And at the heart of it all is London Fields Lido.Caroline, who serves freshly baked croissants and toasties at a kiosk in the lido, has lived in the neighbourhood for 33 years and has seen the new arrivals flood in. Her flat overlooks the park and she complains about the impact of the crowds – the shortage of toilets and the noise. She regrets the loss of community spirit, and feels that, with rare exceptions, the incomers don’t know how to be good neighbours. ‘I think they’re afraid, they don’t want to mix,” she says. “People walk past you as though you’ve got green wires coming out of your head.”The original Lido is an island beach resort in Venice. It became the popular name for open air pools in the 1930s, bringing continental holiday glamour to gloomy British summers during a boom for building outdoor pools. It was with this ambition that London Fields Lido opened in 1932.As Janet Smith reveals in her very enjoyable history Liquid Assets, the fashion for lido-building was driven by an egalitarian ethos. When Morecambe’s open air pool opened in 1936, Sir Josiah Stamp, a director of the Bank of England, declared: “Bathing reduces rich and poor, high and low, to a common standard of enjoyment and health. When we get down to swimming, we get down to democracy.” London County Council (LCC) was particularly zealous in its lido-building programme. Herbert Morrison, leader of the LCC in the late 30s, wanted London to be a “city of lidos”, with every citizen within walking distance of an open air pool.Margaret Thatcher signalled the end for public swimming with her war on local government spending. London Fields Lido was just one of the many casualties in the 1980s as councils cut their budgets.Mike Martin remembers standing in front of the bulldozer at 7am. He was part of a campaign to save London Fields Lido, which had halted the council’s plans to demolish the pool – but he and his fellow campaigners were then tipped off that the demolition team had somehow not got the message and had turned up to do the job anyway. The lido was saved in the nick of time.In their determination to resurrect London Fields Lido, campaigners including Martin joined forces with architects and the Environment Trust, and presented plans for the pool to the community in 2003. Hackney council finally agreed to fund the renovation in 2004.The transformation that has taken place in the neighbourhood since was initially driven by campaigners seeking to regenerate the borough – not only at the lido, but also a few minutes away on Broadway Market, a street below London Fields that was once a drovers’ route into the city. It hosts a hugely successful Saturday market launched by local residents and traders in 2004, two years before the pool reopened. Time Out calls the street “a promenade for the East End fashion set”.Many people are boosters of the newly revitalised area. “What does it say about the last 30-odd years of government in this country that people from other parts of the country are travelling down to London to spend the weekend in a park?” asks Hackney councillor Jon Burke, who is responsible for energy, sustainability and community services, including lidos. “Where have we gone so badly wrong that Liverpool, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle, Hull, don’t offer this standard of living to everybody?”For some of the campaigners who kickstarted the regeneration, however, there is a rueful recognition of the role they may have played in changing the character of the neighbourhood. Liz Veitch, a retired teacher, says that when she first moved to London Fields 25 years ago, she could almost see the tumbleweed blowing down Broadway Market, a street that had once been home to a popular East End market. Hackney council made a number of failed attempts to revive it, but it was only when local residents took on the challenge that the market succeeded. Her late husband, journalist Andrew Veitch, played an instrumental role in the market’s success, setting up a community interest company that he ran for 10 years. The revival of the market was a catalyst that helped transform London Fields into a destination for hipsters, swiftly followed by the reopening of the lido.“In the beginning it was local people trying to make what was a beaten up area a bit more attractive,” says Veitch. “People who moved in here, like us, felt they ought to do more in the community. I would say that the people buying into this area do not seem to share the same sense of community. The youngsters buying or renting these flats are too busy trying to live, but also there is an air of entitlement amongst amongst some of the more affluent members of the next generation. Thatcher’s children if you like. They don’t get involved here. When we were growing up, it was a mantra that was part of our upbringing - if you’re in a community you join in and do what you can.”When Hackney Council began selling off properties in Broadway Market at the start of the millennium, resulting in the eviction of popular local independent businesses, there was a huge campaign to stop the demolition of Cafe Francesca, run by Tony Platia for 30 years. Gentrification became a very dirty word, as Hackney council was accused of betraying the neighbourhood and getting into bed with the property developers.“The lido does not reflect the demography of Hackney,” says Josephine Bacon, who runs the lido user group. “It’s very white, it’s very middle class, it’s quite young. Hackney and Better’s advertisements promote swimming for everyone, saying come and join in, and they have photographs of black people on their posters and banners. Of course there are some black people there, but hardly any. And probably not very many unemployed or low income swimmers either. And I’m not really sure why - whether because it’s too expensive or because London Fields has become a chi-chi area. I don’t know what can be done to make it more inclusive.”It’s a problem that goes beyond Hackney. Swim England’s research in 2015 revealed that ethnic minorities are half as likely to know how to swim as white members of the population. The closure of Hackney’s pools in the noughties may also have had an impact on the next generation of swimmers. It may, however, be true that the number of options is increasing: London Fields Lido is dwarfed by the London Aquatics Centre in Stratford, a legacy of the 2012 Olympics that is home to three pools. The once run-down neighbourhood of Hackney Wick, on the edge of what was the Olympic Park, is now touted as the next London Fields – but that has also meant the demolition of Vittoria Wharf, forcing out a community of poorer residents and artists.London Fields Lido “is not a country club for the affluent,” Burke insists. “It’s important that this facility is able to be accessed by people irrespective of their socioeconomic, ethnic, religious backgrounds.” He says he hopes that the new refurbishment of the changing rooms – which includes the introduction of internal cubicles and internal lockers – will broaden its appeal, as well as satisfying those who have previously been concerned about modesty or security.So far, it’s hard to tell. The newly-refurbished lido reopened in January many of the swimmers are young and white, more typical of newcomers to the neighbourhood than longtime residents. This may not be the classless vision of lido culture that its great political advocates imagined in the 30s when they built the pools in London and across the UK. It may not be the community that the campaigners imagined either, when they fought to revive the lido and what was then a run-down market street. But it’s now a fixture and a landmark – even if that’s as a symbol of ision as much as transformation.A version of this article appears in Tales of Two Cities, edited by Claire Armitstead Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d2591cf99a7eee0ca05f6729ed1bf3378a53607/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f17b19594c7af64a5dd85fcb33431518 1240w","title":"how many people data cambridge analytica facebook","story":"Estimates suggest that tens of millions were affected. But, given the potential for data harvesting under Facebook’s previous policies, this may be a small part of the pictureStatistics are a staple of journalistic accuracy issues, but rarely is a number so big, consequential and hard to verify as the number of Facebook users directly affected by the still emerging Cambridge Analytica story. Is it no more than 30 million, as Cambridge Analytica says? Fifty million, as estimated by the Observer and Guardian journalists who have done so\u0026nbspmuch to disclose the issue? Or 87 million, as\u0026nbspFacebook has ventured? Facebook’s estimate has a fine-print caveat: “We do not know precisely what data the app shared with Cambridge Analytica or exactly how many people were impacted. Using as expansive a methodology as possible, this is our best estimate of the maximum number of unique accounts that directly installed the thisisyourdigitallife app as well as those whose data may have been shared with the app by their friends.”The numbers seem to be calculated by multiplying the number of people known as “seeders” by the average number of Facebook friends seeders are thought to have. A seeder was a Facebook user who installed certain apps that permitted the apps’ controllers to harvest data from the user and the seeder’s (unknowing) Facebook friends. The wide variation in the estimates of people affected results partly from different estimates of seeders – 185,000, 275,000, 300,000 – and different average-number-of-friends figures – 160, 180, 250, 340.Does it matter, in the sense that it is now evident that many, many other entities – academic, commercial, governmental – could have harvested the data of users under previous Facebook policies, for which Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s ethically callow controller, apologised before committees of the US Congress last week, without apparent loss of face?A sense of perspective was given by the Harvard professor Jonathan Zittrain, a sophisticated observer of the social and democratic impacts of digital technologies: “The Cambridge Analytica dataset from Facebook is itself but a lake within an ocean, a clarifying example of a pervasive but invisible ecosystem where thousands of firms possess billions of data points across hundreds of millions of people – and are able to do lots with it under the public radar.”Incrementally since 2015, journalism organisations including the Guardian, the Observer, the New York Times, Politico and the Intercept have shown that a Cambridge Analytica-related entity paid a company called Global Science Research (GSR) for the use of Facebook data that GSR harvested. It appears that the data was to be matched with other datasets of voters’ personal information to which Cambridge Analytica-related entities had access. Broadly, the purpose was to refine profiles of voters to permit more precise messaging.Cambridge Analytica, which did work for the presidential campaigns of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, denies that it used “GSR data or any derivatives of this data in the US presidential election”.GSR’s co-directors were Aleksandr Kogan and Joseph\u0026nbspChancellor. GSR, in effect, commercialised a technique for psychological profiling using big datasets, on which Kogan and several other Cambridge University academics worked.Chancellor joined Facebook as a “quantitative social\u0026nbsppsychologist on the user experience research team”. Is it unreasonable to wonder whether the potential dataset for the team’s work is 2 billion, the total number of Facebook users?• Paul Chadwick is the Guardian’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/613f9807da54d9224a63c55a0ca0f5984dff6d94/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=eac6fef734e33cbfc5a3be52ba3ddce6 1720w","title":"pupils special educational needs children mainstream schools","story":"Policies that seek to push these children out of mainstream schools are turning back the clock to a nastier ageHuman progress is slow to happen and sometimes hard to see: in an era as troubled as ours, the world can easily look as though it is regressing at speed. But look back, and you may see how far we have come. I grew up in a world where grim words such as “handicapped” and “retarded” were part of everyday speech, and disabled people were too often shut away. People put money in charity tins to salve their consciences, and then went back to their ignorance. A sure sign of the way society kept some people at arm’s length was the inhuman use of the definite article: people knew about “the deaf”, “the blind” and “the disabled”, but didn’t give them much thought.Many of these attitudes linger. But millions of people now know that even the word “disability” often does little justice to who people actually are, and how much the concept blurs into the supposedly “able” population. In the field of autism, the new paradigm of “neuroersity” underlines a similar point. On a good day, it can feel like a set of old prejudices may at last be being laid to rest. Human beings are complex: as the American writer Steve Silberman puts it in his book NeuroTribes, “Just because a computer is not running Windows doesn’t mean it’s broken. Not all the features of atypical human operating systems are bugs.”And then you look at the English education system – or, more specifically, the arrangements and policies for kids with so-called special educational needs – and wonder what happened. Cuts are deepening, and there is a rising sense of children who do not fit in being pushed out lest they threaten the gods of discipline, rote\u0026nbsplearning and competitive exam performance.At the last count, 4,152 children deemed to have special needs had not been found a school place (up from 776 in 2010), and most of them were forced to stay at home without any formal provision. Even if they are in school, thousands more are increasingly being denied the support they need.The ideal of inclusion is based on the simple principle that schools should reflect the world at large, so that education in the dry stuff of spelling and sums is accompanied by schooling kids in the meaning of ersity. Hearing people’s stories, you rather get the sense that this ideal is slowly being superseded by a mixture of chaos and the gradual return of segregation.As things stand, the government funds the majority of pre-16 state education through the dedicated schools grant, one of whose elements is the so-called high needs block, meant to cover the education of children who either need intensive support in mainstream education, or go to special schools. From 2011 up to now, the high needs block has effectively been frozen – and to make things worse, new government rules now limit councils’ ability to top up special–needs funding from the much bigger budgets intended for mainstream schools as a whole.Amid an across-the-board spending squeeze, dozens of local authorities are running high needs deficits. Across England as a whole, there is reckoned to be a £400m gap between what councils say they require for their high needs provision and what the government is providing. So schools are cutting back on teaching assistants, special needs training and outside help. If you have a child with special needs, or know anyone who does, you will know what all this entails. One-to-one provision at school often makes the difference between a child progressing or withdrawing. Without such support, it can feel like the sky is falling in.At the same time, sweeping reforms to the special needs system – which, among other things, extend the state’s responsibilities to thousands of people up to the age of 25 – have been botched and underfunded. There are real concerns about academies either excluding kids with special needs or pushing parents to choose other schools. In an absurd twist, people are now exiting the public-sector system and successfully pushing councils to fund places at independent special schools.In the London borough of Hackney, where a brilliant group of parents is fighting cuts to special needs provision and organising a legal challenge under the banner of Hackney Special Education Crisis, this latter cost now accounts for around half of a nearly £6m high needs overspend. It also threatens to create a vicious circle: more children leaving mainstream schools as their special needs provision gets cut, rising bills for special school places, even more cuts as a result.Meanwhile, many lives are getting more difficult. I spoke this week to the mother of a 10-year-old boy who was diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when he was five. After three unsuccessful attempts, he now has a formal education, health and care plan that in theory makes his provision dependable and accountable. But the support at his inner London school has been diluted, and she now worries about him being bullied. Looking ahead to secondary school, she says, “We worry won’t be able to get him the support he needs. We’re going to have to battle.” Another mother told me about her 10-year-old son, recently excluded from school for two days, and promised provision that has yet to materialise. “I have a document, and I go to meetings, but I don’t see any results,” she said.It would be easy to think that this is all about austerity, but it is worse than that. In the Conservatives’ 2010 manifesto, there was a pledge to “end the bias towards the inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream schools”, and push back against “the ideologically driven closure of special schools”. In the context of education policy, these pledges have since taken on a more sinister aspect.We all know what modern English education policy is all about: results, league tables, a fixation with “discipline”. The stupid Tory obsession with grammar schools is of a piece with that. Where, you wonder, does\u0026nbspspecial needs education fit in. The beginnings of an answer, perhaps, lie in a government announcement in 2017 that under the auspices of the free schools programme, there are to be 19 new “special free schools”, providing “high quality provision for children\u0026nbspwith special educational needs and disabilities”, to add to around 30 free schools that have already opened. Some councils’ policies are seemingly starting to reflect similar logic. If this causes anyone disquiet, they should get in touch with a pressure group called Allfie – the Alliance for Inclusive Education. “What we’re fighting against is segregated education,” one of their staff members told me this week. “We’re talking about an ideological drive.”I have a child with special educational needs. He’s 11 – and, with a lot of support, he has been taught alongside his peers in mainstream state schools since he was four. He has benefited immeasurably: quite apart from how much he likes such subjects as music, science and IT, he has started to acquire some of the everyday social skills he finds difficult. But that is only half the point. His presence at his endlessly encouraging, proudly erse school means that his peers understand what human difference means in practice. This is the ideal we are now going to have to fight for – before it gets snuffed out, with tragic consequences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/559494bf28e04ae011a5a6e1141b1e0046b0a85a/0_0_4866_2919/master/4866.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6cfb508aa348a041c09e46678f3f6c41 1240w","title":"arts industry report asks where are all the working class people","story":"Film, broadcasting, publishing and performing sectors nowhere near representative of UK Working-class people continue to be hugely under-represented in the arts, and the people at the top – mostly well-paid, middle-class white men – are least likely to see it. This conclusion was reached in a new report published today, billed as the first sociological study on social mobility in the cultural industries. The study used data from interviews with 237 people who work in the creative industries to shine light on a problem that the report’s authors said is a longstanding one.The research shows that the people most attached to the idea of the arts being a meritocracy – that the best jobs go to those with the most talent – were white middle-class men who occupied the highest-paid jobs and who were most able to bring about change.One of the paper’s authors, Dave O’Brien, said the sector was “quite socially closed” and “dominated by middle-class white people”. He said the sector was well aware of the problems exposed in the report, which raised questions about why things did not change. “If it knows there are these social problems, why isn’t it doing better? Why is it much more like an elite profession rather than being open and meritocratic? The sector almost congratulates itself as being the good guys.” O’Brien said it was time for people to ask: “Are we the bad guys?”The prevalence of unpaid work in the arts reinforces social inequality, the report says. But there are also more subtle barriers to entry, including “the homogeneous values, attitudes and tastes of people working in cultural occupations”. That includes the fact that cultural workers tend to be socially exclusive and are friends with other creatives and less likely to know someone like a bus driver or a factory worker.The Panic report, a detailed follow-up to research published in 2015, has been released by Create London and Arts Emergency, a charity set up to challenge the “old boys’ network” in the creative industries.The report follows a separate weekend of discussions and screenings at the British Film Institute exploring what it means to be working class in film and TV.The keynote interview was with Maxine Peake, who spoke of the prejudice she had regularly experienced from people in the industry. Many, for example, assumed that people from the north would be working class: “There is only one class in the north, and that’s working class, and if you’re a woman you will be slightly brassy and a bit blowzy if you’re a man you’re either aggressive or you’re angsty and poetic. That is the entire north in a nutshell.”Peake revealed she had been under pressure to sound more posh in the first series of the BBC One barrister drama Silk,. “I went to Rada … and I have still got this accent, so it is a fallacy.”Many speakers talked of the problems in being the gatekeepers, the people at the top. Paul Roseby, chief executive of the National Youth Theatre, said over his decade in the job he had encountered the same Oxbridge-educated people at the BBC in the same jobs. “There does seem to be an iron curtain around opportunity at some of our national institutions we hear the phrase ‘hard to reach’. Well, you are not hard to reach – we are,” he said.Other issues that came up at the BFI’s “working-class heroes” event were reductions in drama teaching in schools and cuts to youth services.Many actors stressed that the profession has always been incredibly hard to get into and that most do not succeed.Lesley Manville, Oscar-nominated this year for her role in The Phantom Thread, said the struggle could be a good thing. “For young people starting now, there is this pressure that it’s all got to come together very quickly. When I started, nobody ever dreamed of making films or going to America it just didn’t happen. You just did the work. There’s so much now about young people being, ‘Are you on social media, are you this are you that, are you in this magazine?’ Get rid of that, it’s nonsense. It’s only about the work.”The Labour party last year held its own inquiry into inequality in the cultural sector, and published a report, Acting Up, which concluded that the word “class” was often missing from the debate about access and ersity.

It was three years ago and I know how to win. I believe in myself but I don’t play.”Jay Rodriguez’s second-half winner meant City securing the league title with five games to spare. “I don’t know if I was the first or second or third but I congratulated them face to face when I had the chance,” Mourinho said. “If I was in their position, I would be very upset if someone said they won because United lost against West Brom. They won because they were the best team and lost only a few points.”“With my experience you don’t titles with inconsistency. You win, of course, with quality, but with consistency in every level, not just the performance level but also the mental level. One of the things we have to improve is consistency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e99be583ef877126d4ee9ba9440e9a0485a65bdc/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2b650163336701d54b97969d5a984b3b 1240w","title":"premier league 10 talking points from weekend action","story":"José Mourinho needs to make drastic changes, Rafael Benítez is getting best out of his players and Jordan Ayew is on a missionHaving so meekly allowed Manchester City to claim the Premier League title, a process of rebuilding Manchester United into future champions starts now. The non-inclusion of Marouane Fellaini, Daley Blind, Matteo Darmian and Luke Shaw in José Mourinho’s match‑day 18 for this game at Old Trafford indicated where a long-awaited clear-out of David Moyes and Louis van Gaal recruits is likely to begin. But it will take more than that to revitalise United. The shapeless sludge of this performance against West Brom was no anomaly. Chief among the reasons United have been left in City’s wake is Mourinho’s inability to get the best from his purported stars. Paul Pogba lasted less than an hour before being substituted, while Alexis Sánchez waits to reveal anything like the form of his best days at Arsenal. John Brewin• Match report: Manchester United 0-1 West Bromwich Albion• ‘I know how to win – but I don’t play,’ says MourinhoManchester United’s surprise defeat by West Brom handed Pep Guardiola’s side the title after a topsy-turvy fortnight that defied all predictions. The question now is whether Manchester City can follow up their achievements next season by winning the prize that the club covets more than any other. Despite Guardiola’s insistence that winning the Premier League was more of an achievement, the failure to add to the two Champions League titles he won at Barcelona is what he will ultimately be judged on. Recruiting another central midfielder to ease the burden on Fernandinho will be a major priority this summer, as will providing extra ammunition to the forward line given Sergio Agüero’s troubles with injury. Ed Aarons• Man City crowned Premier League champions• Man City 2017-18 player ratings: how title winners stack up• Jonathan Wilson: City earn a place in pantheon of great sidesLeaving themselves with too much to recover has been the story of the season for Leicester City. Defeat at Burnley, who scored their goals in the sixth and ninth minutes, left Claude Puel’s side nine points off seventh place, thus highly unlikely to be playing in the Europa League next season. The club’s owners continue to count the cost of a misplaced faith in Craig Shakespeare’s credentials to be a permanent manager rather than caretaker or assistant. Puel’s appointment in October after just two victories in nine games proved a far more adept decision but Leicester’s record of having now lost more games (12) than their 11 wins indicates a squad still failing to live up to its potential. And this is likely to be the last season Riyad Mahrez is around at the King Power Stadium. John BrewinThe focus was drawn inexorably towards Wilfried Zaha, whose switch to Ivory Coast will always have the England setup cursing. Yet another in Crystal Palace ranks excelled in the M23 derby on Saturday to suggest he could yet have a role to play in Russia. This was Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s best performance at senior club level, the Chelsea loanee driving the hosts forward in a dominant opening period. After more than three months out with ankle trouble, the 22-year-old has swiftly recaptured form. “He has qualities,” said Roy Hodgson. “He was very good at screening, keeping the ball. He’s very good at beating players. His workrate has been very good. If he can play regularly for the last part of the season, then we will see him doing more and more as a player.” A place in the World Cup squad is far from outlandish. Dominic Fifield• Match report: Crystal Palace 3-2 Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion• The Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photosHuddersfield defied the odds to reach the Premier League and are on the verge of an even more improbable achievement this season. They will probably avoid relegation from the top flight – beating Everton at home next weekend would practically confirm that – and if they do they will have debunked the notion a team can only survive if they have a core of wily Premier League veterans. Only three of the 24 players used by David Wagner this season had Premier League experience and two of those barely featured this season (Dean Whitehead has played 65 minutes, while Martin Cranie made three appearances before being sold in January). Huddersfield’s players do have experience of keeping cool in high-stakes duels, thanks to their play-off triumph last year, and the benefit of playing for one of England’s best‑run clubs. Paul DoyleMohamed Salah’s 30th Premier League goal this season and 40th in all competitions for Liverpool was not the only statistic that had Anfield purring against Bournemouth. Despite an exhausting midweek win against Manchester City in the Champions League there was no let-up from Jürgen Klopp’s team as they took their goals tally under the German to 300 in 148 games. Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané have scored 82 goals this season – the highest total from Liverpool’s three leading scorers in a single campaign. The manager wants more. Klopp said: “Three hundred is really a massive number. I love watching that kind of football but I don’t want to be the entertainer and it is like: ‘Oh we had fun but we didn’t win anything.’ I know the reason we come here together is to win things but I think the way you try to do it is important.” Andy Hunter• Match report: Liverpool 3-0 Bournemouth• Salah says European triumph is more important than goals recordThe best coaches improve players and, by that criterion, Rafaek Benítez must be regarded as exceptional. An alarmingly limited and inexperienced Newcastle squad are up to 10th, on 41 points, having just secured a fourth straight win, at Arsenal’s expense. Since New Year’s Day they have collected 22 points from a possible 36. Much of that is down to the extraordinary progress made by, among others, Jonjo Shelvey, Jamaal Lascelles, Mo Diamé, Ayoze Pérez and Paul Dummett since August. “Staying up is a fantastic achievement in what has been a very difficult season,” said Benítez, whose January loan recruitment of the Sparta Prague goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and Chelsea left winger Kenedy have proved shrewd. “Every week the whole team is progressing and improving. I’m really pleased.” Louise Taylor• Match report: Newcastle United 2-1 Arsenal• Jonathan Wilson: Arsenal fail to learn their lesson• Wenger says Arsenal defeat at Newcastle was ‘a worry character wise’There were a number of variables at work at St Mary’s. First was the bullish strength of Olivier Giroud, whose determination to make the most of every moment led to a change in attitude throughout the team. Then there was the mental frailty of Southampton, perhaps to be expected of a club in deep relegation trouble. And finally there was a tactical tweak and the rare sighting of a Blues back four. Conte’s preference for a three-man defence is renowned, the security it provides being the bedrock on which the rest of Chelsea’s play is built. It also puts a lot of stress on the wing‑backs to deliver from forward positions. Last season they rose to the challenge, this time not so much. Marcos Alonso remains a potent threat but not in this match, and when he stepped back to allow Willian and Pedro to roam the wide spaces Chelsea posed a very different set of questions. Paul MacInnes• Match report: Southampton 2-3 Chelsea• Hughes tells Southampton players to ‘get details right’ to survive• Kirby sends Chelsea into Women’s FA Cup final against ArsenalEvery club in the relegation battle needs a talisman to provide hope and inspiration, and Swansea have found theirs in Jordan Ayew. The 26-year-old has been a player transformed since Carlos Carvalhal took over as manager, scoring six times but bringing far more than just goals to a team who were so prosaic and toothless in the first half of the season. Ayew’s ability to hold the ball up, together with his skill and trickery, gives Swansea an attacking dimension badly missed during his three-match ban. He returned against Everton, playing alongside his brother André, and was a constant threat, linking play, creating chances and scoring an equaliser – his 11th goal of the season – with a wonderfully taken half‑volley. “We know that we will always fight and die for this club, because it has given me and my brother so much,” Jordan said afterwards. Stuart JamesTottenham’s excellent run of 14 games without defeat came to an end against a resurgent Manchester City clearly with a point to prove but Mauricio Pochettino will be concerned that his side can pick themselves up quickly for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United. For all his success in making Spurs into genuine contenders, Pochettino has yet to win a trophy as a manager while it is now a decade since Tottenham supporters were last able to celebrate some silverware, the 2008 League Cup. Even if he has previously insisted that the domestic cup competition would not make up for failure elsewhere, with a top four place almost in the bag before Tuesday’s trip to face Brighton in the league, there is no reason why their manager cannot approach their semi-final full of ambition.

I bought the house in 2012 for £115,000, it’s now worth £135,000 and there is £80,000 left on the mortgage.Originally I lived in the house and commuted but since my family moved in I started renting a place near to my work. My mum has been paying rent all the time she and my brother have lived there. It has been fine up to now, but I don’t see my mum ever leaving my house as it’s within walking distance of the hospital she works in (she never learned to drive) and it’s close to her friends. She is due to retire in the next couple of years and as she’s had some health issues, I would like to be able to let her stay in the house for as long as she wants (and by extension my younger brother who will be able to help if her health deteriorates). What I’m not sure about is what I need to do about buying another house for me to live in.My mum wants to give me £50,000 towards another home for me but if she did, she would stop paying me rent although she would keep paying the other bills. I’m single and about to turn 30, my credit rating is good and I earn £25,000. Other than the money my mum would give me I have about £5,000 in savings and could save a bit more if needed.Should I change my current mortgage to a buy-to-let and use the £50,000 as a deposit on a new property close to work? A one-bed flat near where I work is £150,000 while a small two-bed (preferable as then I could rent out the second room) costs between £160,000 and £180,000.I’m really not living in the house any more, could I class the place I rent as my main house if I change my current mortgage to a buy-to-let first will I then be able to limit my stamp duty getting a home close to work? LBA To answer your last question first, no, you can’t class the property you rent as your main residence for the purposes of working out if you have to pay the higher rate of stamp duty land tax (SDLT). To avoid the higher rate of SDLT, you would have to sell the home you currently own (and used to live in) and replace it with another one. If you buy another property without selling the first the higher rates of SDLT will apply because you’ll end up owning two properties.As to whether you should replace your current mortgage with a buy-to-let loan, you need to talk to an independent mortgage adviser. Buy-to-let mortgages for properties which are used by family members do exist but they are very very rare. Independent whole-of-market mortgage advisers Niche Advice says that it knows of only two lenders that provide “regulated” buy-to-let mortgages which is the type you need if you want to let property to close family (which includes parents, grandparents, children, siblings, spouses and civil partners). Whereas standard buy-to-let mortgages take rental income into account, buy-to-let mortgages that are regulated (by the Financial Conduct Authority) are treated more like residential mortgages. In the words of Mansfield building society – which is one of the very few lenders that offers regulated or “family” buy-to let mortgages – the lender “must be satisfied that the applicant’s current, contingent and proposed overall financial situation (including income and indebtedness) can support the mortgage repayments” without taking account of rental income. So it’s affordability that is the most important aspect when assessing a regulated mortgage application rather than rental income. In a lender’s view, having two mortgages on a salary of £25,000 might not be considered an affordable option. So it’s likely that you’ll have to put your plans for buying a home near your work on hold"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbea876b60909b6e85c378e50cf2ddb7318a0cfd/0_97_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9dc020d30e2257a73e2fb0c69d0e59cd 1240w","title":"andrew wk review 12 step party programme from rocks self help guru","story":"O2 Forum Kentish Town, LondonAdrenaline-fuelled anthems meet pop philosophy as the rocker mixes giddy hedonism with vulnerability At their best – the neanderthal hedonism of I Get Wet, the hammering, catchy blitz of Party Til You Puke – WK’s adrenalised, over-driven rock party anthems are so “dumb” they’re brilliant. But while there’s a knowing ridiculousness to much of his set tonight, you’d be a fool to mistake it for anything as cynical as a joke. For one thing, he’s totally earnest in his role as party-starter, pumping his fists and delivering thumbs-ups and quickly sweating until his white T-shirt is chewing-gum grey, so full-on and energetic and natural an entertainer that Queen missed a trick not nabbing WK as their post-Freddie frontman. But there’s also a depth beneath the giddy hedonism, especially on the tunes from recent album You’re Not Alone, his first set of new songs in 12 years. The lyrics are darker and concern subjects beyond partying and puking, the music more complex and ambitious, wild and dramatic, as if someone took Jim Steinman slam-dancing. The album includes passages from his secondary career as a motivational speaker, some of which he revisits tonight, drilling his fans to “stay strong and keep on going,” sounding like a well-therapised Iggy Pop.Andrew WK clearly adores his followers, and the affection is mutual, with several stage-ers impersonating his uniform of white-tee-and-jeans (another is dressed, bafflingly, as Captain Birdseye). But you sense he needs these acolytes to stay aloft, that he imagines he might not exist if they weren’t here to bellow along to his titanic choruses. Indeed, his recent wilderness years, following a confusing legal dispute, perhaps explain this vulnerability, and the passion with which he delivers Music Is Worth Living For and the rueful Break the Curse. Mostly, however, WK doesn’t dwell on the darkness, and given our current bleak epoch, his dedication to the cause of partying is a blessing.“This song’s about taking all your fears and throwing them into the abyss!” he bellows before Tear It Up. Moments later he’s leading his throng through another rousing chorus of “We wanna get wasted!” And moments after that, You Will Remember Tonight achieves the platonic ideal of gleeful airhead rock before the song collapses into an orgy of arch rock’n’roll excess, a barrage of blast beats and three guitarists soloing wildly at once, as WK hammers his piano like a homicidal Liberace.

And last year it was in EventCity, a soulless conference hall by the Trafford Centre shopping centre, that he launched the party’s general election campaign, flanked by Labour’s newly elected Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham.If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you. Let us know which way you’re thinking of voting, and which issues are most crucial to you locally.You can share your thoughts using our encrypted form here. One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.It was Burnham’s soaraway success in the inaugural mayoral elections that gave Labour hope that it could wrench Trafford back from the Tories. As the only candidate with any name recognition on the ballot, everyone knew he’d win overall – just not in Trafford, where the council leader, Sean Anstee, was standing.Anstee’s bloodless face at the count told a different story. “Oh my god, Andy’s won Hale Central,” shrieked one Labour activist, referring to one of Trafford’s millionaire enclaves, which boasts a high street with four cosmetic surgery clinics and some of the best grammar schools in the country.Kate Green is the Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston, which could be described as the “other” Trafford. It includes the poorer bit in the north, which begins in the terraces around Manchester United’s football ground, and takes in Flixton and Urmston, where residents are always complaining about traffic jams caused by the nearby Trafford Centre and the M60 ring road. Life expectancy in some streets is a decade less than in the leafy south of the borough.Green senses Tory blood. “I’m absolutely confident that the Tories are on the back foot in this borough,” she says. “I’ve been knocking on doors week in, week out, ever since the general election last year and they are definitely on the run.” In her constituency, which has been Labour since its inception, sure. But in the posh bits?Absolutely, she says: “There are some very wealthy parts of Trafford but let’s not forget Andy Burnham’s spectacular result in the mayoral election last year. He won many of those very wealthy wards hands down, ahead of the local candidate, Sean Anstee. So I think we can be confident that the Labour vote is broad as well as deep.”Andrew Western, leader of the Labour group on Trafford council, is less bullish. “Yes, Andy Burnham won Hale Central, but that was a freak,” he says. He can’t predict the result: “Normally I’d say to you with some confidence, ‘this is what’s going to happen’. But the world’s gone mad. I don’t know what constitutes normal any more.”The Labour party is concentrating its efforts on winning three key wards from the Tories, which would be enough to slide the council into no overall control. For the first time in history it thinks it’s got a decent shot at Davyhulme East, near to Trafford General, the hospital where Aneurin Bevan launched the NHS in 1948.Local candidate Jayne Dillon is capitalising on changes at the hospital in her campaign. A former midwife who gave up work to look after her three children, two of whom have autism, she sympathises with residents unhappy that there is no longer a full A\u0026ampE clinic. “My mum had to be blue-lighted in an ambulance across to Salford,” she tells voters. That’s just a five-mile journey, but factor in the shopping traffic and the perennially clogged motorway and it can take an hour.Dillon has tapped into other local bugbears, such as opaque plans to turn a much-loved local leisure centre into houses and a base for a local basketball team without proper community consultation, and discontent over plans to build on the green belt in Flixton. Labour also thinks it is in with a chance in upmarket Altrincham. This former market town is home to many lawyers and accountants who commute in on the tram or train to Manchester. Labour has only managed to hold it for a single term in the 1990s.But the Conservatives are in trouble locally. Matthew Sephton, one of the three Tory councillors, was jailed this year for possession of child abuse images. And the well-regarded deputy council leader, Alex Williams, whose wife Lady Williams of Trafford ran the borough council between 2004 and 2009 (they fell in love in the council chamber), is retiring.Step forward one of Labour’s more unusual candidates: Frenchman Stephane Savary, who stood for France’s social democratic Socialist party when he was just 20. A mortgage broker who is in the middle of converting to Judaism, he has been busy recently retweeting the antisemitic abuse he receives on Twitter.He believes if Labour can win in well-heeled Trafford it can win a majority nationally: “It will show that we are winning the middle ground. If we win Trafford we can make an example of what a Labour government would be like.”The Tories, meanwhile, are hammering the themes of grammar schools and low parking fees and slagging off Corbyn. The Greens are also in contention in Altrincham, to Labour’s chagrin.Savary keeps things local on the doorstep. A promise to sort out parking madness extracts a promise from one 77-year-Tory voter to switch to Labour. “But only in the local elections. I don’t like Jeremy Corbyn,” says the retired accountant.But if Savary’s canvas returns are accurate, he is in contention in Altrincham: last Thursday he had spoken to 2,150 residents and extracted promises to vote Labour from 1,096.• This article was amended on 16 April 2018 to clarify that Trafford General is near, but not in, the Davyhulme East ward."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da4cac23695b7fb6fa524d1721bd7aa4159e6964/96_0_2809_1686/master/2809.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=778a2798dbf110d679d63552ad4f7701 1720w","title":"nasa to launch tess on hunt for 20000 new worlds","story":"Telescope hitching ride on a SpaceX rocket designed to spot alien worlds If the vagaries of weather and rocket science do not intervene, the most ambitious search for alien worlds around the brightest stars in the sky will begin on Monday with the launch of Nasa’s newest planet-hunting spacecraft.After final preparations at the weekend, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or Tess, is on course for take off as early as 6.32pm local time (11.32pm UK) from Cape Canaveral in Florida, the first opportunity mission controllers have to launch in a window that remains open until June.The lofting of hardware high into space often calls for a holding of breath, but for those who have ploughed time and money into the $200m (£140m) Tess space telescope there is an extra frisson. Theirs is the first Nasa mission to hitch a ride on a Falcon 9, a rocket made by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company, and which was certified for such missions only in February.Barring any mishaps, such as a “rapid unscheduled disassembly” – a glorious euphemism Musk used to describe the explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket stage in 2015 – Tess will be flung into a highly elliptical orbit around Earth that has never been attempted before. The space telescope will swing as far out as the moon as it scours the heavens for planets, then swoop back towards Earth to beam home its data. Each orbit will take nearly 14 days.“Right now, everything is go for a launch on Monday,” said Stephen Rinehart, the Tess project scientist at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. “Putting stuff up in space is not without risk, but at this point there is nothing more we can do. We think we’ve got a spacecraft that is ready to kick ass once it’s up in orbit.”Tess comes hot on the heels of Nasa’s Kepler space telescope which transformed scientists’ understanding of planets beyond the solar system. When Kepler launched in 2009, astronomers knew that alien worlds circled faraway stars, but had little idea of their number and sizes. As of last month, Kepler had found more than 2,300 “exoplanets” a similar number await confirmation.Based on Kepler’s observations, astronomers now believe that the Milky Way is home to at least two billion potentially habitable planets where conditions are neither too hot nor too cold for life-sustaining water to flow. But for all Kepler’s success, it observed only a fraction of the sky and most of the stars it studied are extremely faint, making it hard for astronomers to look more closely at the planets that swing around them. This is where Tess comes in. The space telescope will spend two years observing 200,000 of the brightest stars in the sky. Most will be no more than 300 light years away. Like its predecessor, Tess is designed to spot alien worlds by detecting the subtlest of shadows they cast as they move across the face of their parent stars.Bill Chaplin, the professor of astrophysics at Birmingham University, will use Tess data to look at how stars contract and expand as seismic waves surge through them. His calculations will help astronomers confirm the masses and ages of the new planets they find. “When you look up at the night sky, we’ll know about the planets that are around the stars you can see with the naked eye,” he said.Mission scientists hope to spot 500 Earth-sized planets and perhaps 20,000 new worlds in total. Astronomers will then draw on ground-based telescopes, and soon-to-launch space-based observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope scheduled for 2020, to look more closely at the planets. With those follow-up measurements in hand, scientists can work out the planets’ masses and densities, and perhaps even what gases fill their atmospheres. It is no simple task, but if water, methane and other key molecules are found, scientists can start to talk about whether life could, or did, gain a foothold on the distant worlds.“There are some people on the mission who are very, very, very keen to find Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of their host stars and that would be absolutely fabulous,” said Rinehart. “But the data on all these planets is interesting, because they help us form a picture of how planetary systems form and evolve. It’s going to be a game-changer in our ability to study planets.”In 2028, the European Space Agency plans to launch Ariel, the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey, to study the atmospheres of 1,000 exoplanets ranging in size from Jupiter to not much larger than Earth. “Tess will provide hundreds of exoplanets, especially super-Earths, which will be optimal targets for atmospheric characterisation with Ariel,” said Giovanna Tinetti, principal investigator on the mission at UCL.But first Tess must reach its intended orbit. Should the Falcon 9 release the space telescope on the correct trajectory, mission scientists will spend 60 days running tests on its systems and sensors, calibrating the cameras and ironing out any bugs. The first batches of data are expected to land in June, but researchers will work on the information for months before making results public.“My real hope is that we start finding things that we didn’t expect,” said Rinehart. “If we knew what all the answers were before we launched the mission, why the hell would we fly the mission?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165594c0a018e5bc8fd44af1d6f1e0afe783a7f1/0_259_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=753d6942c7d2626af14b48ca118c2500 1240w","title":"value of london flats slashed by grenfell style cladding","story":"Home in New Capital Quay, Greenwich, worth £50,000 rather than £475,000, owner toldA homeowner in a housing complex in London with Grenfell-type cladding has been told the value of her £475,000 home has collapsed and is now just £50,000.Galliard Homes, the developer of the 11-block complex in New Capital Quay in south-east London, is facing a £30m-£40m bill to replace the cladding and is locked in a legal dispute over who should pay.The dispute, which could take years to resolve, has left Cecile Langevin, 32, and potentially thousands of others up and down the country, with an unsellable flat.“It is like someone has taken away our life choices, our freedom,” she said. “And nobody is doing anything about it,” she added, in tears.Langevin has a two-year-old son and was due to give birth to her second child on Saturday. She had put their flat on the market in the hope of moving out of London to a bigger home.She got a Rics-approved surveyor to value her flat recently and was shocked when he came back with a £50,000 price tag. But now she realises the whole complex is blighted.“All ongoing sales in the development have fallen through. Banks are not lending to potential buyers and provide valuations of zero for flats in our development,” she said.Langevin is one of about 2,000 residents in NCQ in Greenwich, believed to be the largest private development found to have flammable cladding after the west London disaster that cost 71 lives.“I don’t sleep at night. I wake up most nights for a few hours and I write emails to people I think that can help,” said Langevin.“I can’t move very fast. What would happen if my husband was away one night? We are on the seventh floor. What if if I was there with my son and new baby and all the people were at the stairs and I couldn’t get out?” she asked.While cladding remains on such buildings, the fire brigade requires 247 fire patrol in case evacuation is needed, but in three cases so far in private blocks, including one in Croydon and another in Salford, this has meant leaseholders will face bills potentially of tens of thousands of pounds.“It is quite shocking that the residents are living in potential death traps while everybody else tries to deny liability for the cost of making them safe. There is the potential for the residents to bring group legal proceedings to recover the cost of fixing the buildings and for the considerable distress they must be suffering,” said Chris Haan, a lawyer at the London law firm Leigh Day.He has been approached by a number of home owners in NCQ and said they may have a case against the developers for breach of contract when they sold homes “fit for habitation when completed”.Langevin funded the flat in 2014 through some savings, a mortgage with a high-street bank and a £95,000 government loan under the Help to Buy scheme designed to help people without enough savings to get on the property ladder.Langevin believes that many other homes in the NCQ development were purchased on the Help to Buy scheme, which was heavily promoted by Galliard at the development’s launch.She has had no answer from Target HCA, which is administering the scheme, other than to say it is a “novel” request. “They are being evasive, because they know if they have to do this for me they have to do it for everyone who asks,” she said.Regardless of how much of the government loan she has to repay, Langevin is still subject to huge negative equity because the value of the flat has plummeted.She said she is at her wits’ end and suffering from stress over her situation. She said she can’t move out and rent to others because she would feel terrible “if they were caught in a fire”. It is also not permissible under her Help to Buy contract.She contacted the housing minister, Dominic Raab, but he did not reply. “I don’t think he cares about ordinary people,” she said. It is likely that thousands of private homeowners are in Langevin’s situation, with government data showing 301 blocks over 18 metres tall have Grenfell-type cladding, of which 130 are in the private sector and 13 are hospitals or schools. Of the public buildings, only seven have had their cladding replaced so far.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We have made clear that we want to see private sector landlords follow the lead of the social sector and not pass on the costs of essential cladding replacement to leaseholders.“We are keeping the situation under review and ministers are meeting industry representatives shortly to discuss this.”Campaigners said the cladding was causing financial ruin for homeowners.“The blight caused by Grenfell is national and the government doesn’t seem to be too bothered about that. So far, what we have heard from Greenwich and Croydon is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Martin Boyd, a trustee at the charity Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, a service that advises leaseholders on their rights over cladding and other issues.Galliard Homes declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e11dfbbf45b810586a3e78734fdace058303e0af/0_133_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9f2baf43c177065a630f2e531eb207df 1240w","title":"grand national aintree tv figures","story":"The news on Sunday morning that Saint Are, now a veteran of five Grand Nationals, was well enough to return to Tom George’s stable after Saturday’s race at Aintree capped another great weekend for the sport’s most high-profile event.For the sixth year running since the old wooden cores in the fences were replaced by more forgiving plastic, every horse returned to its yard afterwards and, where the last National on heavy ground was a grim, attritional spectacle, the race this year produced a close finish and a popular winner in Tiger Roll.There is, of course, an element of risk attached to any horse race and it is inevitable that a horse will suffer a fatal injury in the National eventually. But we are now at a point where the effect of the changes to the fences before the 2013 renewal is becoming increasingly clear.But the most significant difference, as might be expected since the fences are now more forgiving, is in the number of fallers. Proper statisticians may flinch at this point, because half a dozen years is not, admittedly, an extended sample, but the effect does seem obvious and unmistakable. Between 2007 and 2012 there were 57 fallers in the National from 240 starters. Since the changes to the fences there have been 32 from 236.Fewer fallers, inevitably, also means fewer horses being brought down in their wake. The ratio of falls to riders being unseated, meanwhile, has shifted from 1.4:1 to, in effect, 1:1 because the number of unseats is virtually unchanged. It appears that mistakes that were once bad enough to cause a fall are now more likely to unship the jockey, while lesser errors that might have been 50-50 to unseat in the past are more likely to leave the rider sitting tight and going on to complete, or pull up when their chance has gone.The sunshine at Aintree on Saturday also added to the generally positive mood around the big race, especially after a damp and chilly Ladies’ Day on Friday. It was not, perhaps, welcomed quite so warmly by ITV’s senior executives, however, as sunny weather was cited as a reason for a slump in the National’s audience figure last year, the first since it grabbed a monopoly on terrestrial racing coverage from Channel\u0026nbsp4.Last year’s ITV coverage is up for a Bafta next month and this year’s also seemed to be well received. Both racing and ITV will hope earnestly for a spike in the figures next year, however, before negotiations start in earnest on a possible extension to the £30m contract.Tips by Greg Wood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a372f794f94ff147e39720359e053fa8489f79f/0_103_3443_2066/master/3443.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=946dc874527a344b346ec63b35ed97ed 1240w","title":"my under 10 matches are the worst no end in sight to youth referee abuse","story":"While many acknowledge that the abuse and assault of referees is endemic in American sports culture, few people seem willing to do anything about itNearly every single day, a sports official becomes the victim of verbal abuse or physical assault. This isn’t just true of professional and collegiate referees – all of whom receive the protection of a security detail – but of the hundreds of thousands of referees who officiate youth and amateur recreational matches across the United States, many of whom are under 18 years of age.Referee administrator Tony Crush still remembers the first time he was physically assaulted while officiating a soccer match.At the time, Crush, then only 15 years old, began bantering with an adult league player after that player complained that Crush had failed to call a foul. The banter grew into a heated argument and, moments later, the player attacked Crush, knocking him temporarily unconscious.Stories like Crush’s take place on soccer fields and basketball courts and baseball diamonds across the United States: a 17-year-old frantically phones her father for help as a mob of angry parents gather around her car a 15-year-old girl sits dazed on the field after a grown man has put his hands on her chest and pushed her to the ground a 16-year-old picks himself up off the ground after being blindsided by a punch during a recreational soccer match.While many people acknowledge that the abuse and assault of referees is endemic in American sports culture, few people seem willing to do anything about it, and fewer still consider just how many of the referees on the receiving end of this abuse are still children.Many of the youngest and most inexperienced of these referees begin their officiating careers by working games at the youngest age levels. In theory, these assignments would provide young referees with the opportunity to learn their craft in a more stress-free environment than the one they might find in the more competitive older age groups. The reality, however, is that the younger age games often lead to the most referee abuse.“It is amazing to me how this would be considered child abuse if someone were yelling at their kid like that in a school setting or a work setting,” Hildman added.One former teenage referee wrote to the Guardian about his experiences refereeing under-11 and under-12 matches as a 16-year-old. In one particular match, a coach pushed him to the ground after a disagreement over a red card.The explanations for this abuse are myriad: parents feeling entitled to yell at the referee because of the escalating costs of youth sports the growing pressure to win in competitive youth sports parents, coaches, and players all expecting a level of officiating commensurate with the pros the broader society’s diminishing respect for authority figures.While there are many possible explanations for the rise in referee abuse, there are just as many potential solutions.In Michigan, for example, where amateur referee John Bieniewicz died after he was physically attacked by an adult player in 2015, activists in the referee community teamed up with state senator Morris Hood to try and pass legislation that would have created stiffer legal penalties for assaulting a referee. That legislation stalled despite the urgent testimony of Bieniewicz’s widow undaunted, Hood is reintroducing the bill this year.Yet even if Michigan were to enact stiffer penalties for referee assault, would that really be enough to change a sports culture that dehumanizes referees?“What is the moral compass that spectators can use to understand that their behavior, no matter what they perceive to be the blame of the situation, is crossing a moral line?” asked Chico Villarruel, a regional referee administrator for US Youth Soccer. “What is the civic discourse that we need to have that minimizes prejudice and racism and all of the other ‘-isms’ that we have in our world including the ‘-ism’ of the treatment of sports officials?”Such a civic discourse first requires a conversation between administrators, parents, coaches and players about the proper treatment of match officials, something that sports leagues across the United States are only beginning to incorporate into their programs.Other leagues and organizations are taking even more drastic measures. In Kentucky, one league has begun fining clubs $250 for every parent dismissed from a match for poor behavior, while another has gone even further, banning exhortations of any kind – positive or negative – from the sidelines.Villarruel believes that there may be an even simpler solution for changing the entire culture around youth and amateur sports in this country: empathy.“Ask parents and ask spectators to be a sports official for one year,” Villarruel said, “and maybe we’ll have a cultural change.”In England, one young referee was unwilling to wait for such a cultural change. After years of verbal and physical altercations with players, parents, and coaches, and deeply disaffected with the lack of response from the English Football Association, 18-year-old Ryan Hampson decided he had had enough.Last year, Hampson took the extraordinary step of calling on his fellow referees to go on strike. In March 2017, more than 2,000 referees across England took up Hampson’s call for a strike, earning the teenager an audience with some of the highest-ranking officials in the FA.“I’d say it takes a lot of guts to stand up and actually tackle this front on,” Hampson told the Guardian. “I’d say it can’t just be done by one person it’s got to be a team. There’s got to be a number of officials who will stand up and will do it and will bite the bullet and go for it and not back down. It takes someone who will genuinely have the determination to follow it through and not be frightened of any repercussions that could be possible from the authorities … saying, ‘No, I’ve had enough.’”In a political moment when teenagers across the country – from minority students in Chicago staging “die-ins” at City Hall to protest inequality in public education to the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School leading a national movement for stricter gun control laws – are organizing and protesting for their own protection, the idea of a strike by underage referees seems far less outlandish than it might have even six months ago.As Hampson points out, officiating for many is a paid job. If you wouldn’t accept verbal and physical abuse in the workplace, why would you accept it on the soccer field or on the basketball court or on the baseball diamond?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa68f228c6833a7ead4cf648d37f681db36cc4b5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2d56caf4400075690cea441989b2d4f0 1240w","title":"rugby union talking points from weekend premiership action","story":"A clean-up job awaits John Kingston’s heir, Gary Graham shines again and Kitchener’s tumble leaves Gopperth the fall-guyHarlequins have been linked with so many coaches since the announcement last week that John Kingston will leave at the end of the season that they could they could set up a sideline transporting supporters. After their recent tie-up with New Zealand, names such as Tana Umaga and Scott Robertson have been mentioned and if Quins take that route it would mean that only three clubs would be headed by an Englishman next season – Exeter, Newcastle and Sale – compared with six at the start of this one. Whoever takes over has a salvage operation: Quins slumped to another defeat, three Gloucester tries in the final 10 minutes gilding their 37-9 victory, and with Worcester next, 11th place is in view. Paul Rees• Robert Kitson: No surprise as Harlequins call time on Kingston • Worcester lifted by Te’o’s pledge to see out contract next seasonIt has been one of the more wacky Premiership seasons. In the past couple of months, Leicester won at Saracens, who in turn indulged in a feeding frenzy at Northampton and Saints savoured league success at Leicester for the first time in 11 years. With two rounds to go, Worcester have yet to secure their top-flight status but have won at Exeter and Leicester. Home comforts are not what they were: Leicester have lost four of their 10 games at Welford Road, their worst run since 2003-04, when they had the excuse of World Cup absentees that was the campaign when they fired Dean Richards as director of rugby, and a fifth against his Newcastle next week will surely end a 14-year love affair with the play‑offs and complete the circle. Paul Rees Star performers were plentiful in Newcastle’s 35-30 win against Sale in one of the most thrilling games of the Premiership season. But special praise should be reserved for Gary Graham. It was a surprise indeed when he first appeared in one of Eddie Jones’s squads but his form since returning from a neck injury certainly seems to justify his place on England’s radar. The national side’s back-row problems are well documented and, with Courtney Lawes and Nathan Hughes both set to miss the summer tour to South Africa, Jones could do worse than looking at Graham. He relishes the hard yards and that abrasive edge will be crucial against the Springboks. Gerard MeagherLondon Irish are now all but mathematically relegated courtesy of Exeter’s latest six-try show of strength. A swift return to the Championship is the last thing the club needs, with financial losses stacking up and their best players set to depart. Declan Kidney offered a polite “no comment”, however, when asked if the Exiles would consider employing either Paddy Jackson or Stuart Olding, who both had their Ulster contracts revoked, and the Chiefs have rubbished claims the latter might find new employers in Devon. Their forwards coach, Rob Hunter, is more concerned with ensuring Exeter finish top for the first time. “We want to come top and then we’ll worry about the semi-final after that,” Hunter said. Robert Kitson• Match report: London Irish 5-45 Exeter Eight carries for 16 metres for Mako Vunipola during his hour on the pitch against Bath, and eight tackles to boot in another impressive display from the England loosehead prop. Why he was on the pitch at all is another matter entirely. Based on Vunipola’s workload during the Six Nations and according to the terms of an agreement between the RFU and Premiership Rugby, Saracens were obliged to rest him for one of the four weekends after the championship. They had not done so before this weekend, so put simply, he should not have played against Bath. The argument goes that Saracens have next week off anyway, but what is the point of the agreement if it is not adhered to? Judging by the scoreline, it seems fair to suggest Saracens would have coped without him, and at best it was an ill-judged risk to select him. GMThe ridiculous sanctification of the airborne player continues. Wasps had a bonus-point try disallowed because replays on the big screen showed Andrew Kitchener go up for a high ball with Christian Wade earlier in the passage and land awkwardly. Jimmy Gopperth was in the vague vicinity and may have laid a finger on the hulking lock. He emphatically did not cause the accident. But in this current climate someone has to be punished if an airborne player hurts himself, and Gopperth saw yellow. Luckily, Wasps intercepted for their fourth in the next play, but it could have cost them dearly. More to the point, when is the scapegoating of honest players going to stop? Michael AylwinThe result of the weekend? How about Leinster 15-17 Benetton, the first time any Italian side has managed a league victory in Dublin. The visitors not only fought back from 12-5 down at half-time but saw off a Leinster side featuring a sprinkling of Irish Six Nations grand slam winners. A weakened Scarlets also shipped 50 points to Edinburgh before this week’s European Champions Cup semi-finals the days of leading sides still being able to win Pro Rugby games with a second team would appear to be over. It came on the same weekend it was announced that SA Rugby’s chief executive, Jurie Roux, and director of rugby, Rassie Erasmus, have both joined the Pro14 board, a move that will not go unnoticed among those plotting the future shape of the English Premiership.

Its presenter, Will Millard, an upbeat writer and expedition leader who seems cut from the cloth of 90s Jamie Oliver, sets out to West Papua in Indonesia to document the holy grail sought by many anthropological documentary-makers – a society untouched by the modern world. Millard has visited the region many times before and speaks Indonesian, but he has yet to meet the remote Korowai people. So, he heads into the rainforest without any fixed plans, in the hope that a “traditional” family will let him film with them for a sustained period. “I want to try something different,” he explains, aware that this has been attempted before, offering four visits over the course of a year as his USP.The twist has been revealed in advance and picked over in the papers already. The Korowai are not as remote a tribe as they once were. They have smartphones, generators and a school. Many of their famous treehouses, built high off the rainforest floor, were constructed for the benefit of previous documentaries, including the BBC’s 2011 series Human Planet. With a growing sense of confusion and disappointment, Millard realises he is being performed to by the people he meets. First, there is Markus, who assumes the role of a treehouse-dweller, but it soon becomes clear that this is a show for the cameras. Markus has a list of prices for “activities”, from hunting for grubs to cooking rat. He sings as he is cooking a meal: “We weren’t like this before.”But Markus is not the only one in on this presentation of tribe life. In the end, we are left with the shell of the documentary that Millard thought he was going to make, propped up by an existential crisis about authenticity, artifice and encroaching modernity.As fascinating as that is, it left me uneasy. Much of the first episode seems more concerned with Millard’s feelings about his thwarted adventure than with the people who have intrigued him for so long. That may be a result of necessity. Once it becomes clear that the Korowai have seen wide-eyed film crews plenty of times before, the focus of the documentary becomes documentary-making. It turns into an ethical quagmire and I am not sure that My Year With the Tribe escapes from it simply by addressing that fact.There is a paradox in Millard’s despair. He seems frustrated that a cash economy, which he puts down to outside visitors, has changed what he had hoped to find. There is some agonised self-flagellation about being part of the problem – “Look around you, mate, you made this” – but he remains determined to be the person to find the remote tribe that has eluded him, in spite of the fact that the search for it turns into “a bit of a disaster” in places, as he admits. Having seen the effects of documentaries such as this being made again and again, he continues to attempt to make one. Perhaps this will be addressed in the remaining two episodes, but something about this jarringly frank series makes me wonder if it will be the last of its kind – and whether that would be such a bad thing.After a well-received pilot, the sketch show Famalam (BBC Two) has been given a four-episode series, first shown online on BBC Three. It is good-natured, daft and occasionally incisive, with its initial sketch laying out its wry wit to particularly sharp effect: a black superhero takes out a gang of drug dealers and stands, triumphantly and expectantly, as the police arrive on the scene. Cut to him being thrown across the bonnet of the car, in cuffs, as “suspect: black male” crackles across the radio and the dealers are handed hot chocolate and blankets.Plenty has been written about how sketch comedy has been revived by the internet’s appetite for brief, shareable clips (one of the stars of Famalam, Tom Moutchi, made his name on Vine) and this certainly feels as if it could exist in isolated, Facebook-friendly bursts. The sketches are rapid-fire and rarely outstay their welcome. Some, like the gag about racist swiping on dating apps, are one-note jokes that pass in a flash. Others, such as the Blaxploitation-flecked countryside crime of Midsomer Motherfuckin’ Murders, luxuriate in a more drawn-out silliness. My favourite was the aunties’ western-inspired showdown over leftovers. It is not hard to see Famalam’s punchlines coming long before they land, but they fly past in such a frenzy of energy that it is hard to mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01d63b2c31f245b0a4650188f5bb3e67f7513b47/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=70ffc8538f92a73bf4492197d797bcd2 1240w","title":"five things james comey interview","story":"The former FBI director was not afraid to talk in detail about Donald Trump, his own family and the alleged pee tapeFormer FBI director James Comey has taken part in his first televised interview since the release of his book about his dealings with Donald Trump, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership. Speaking to ABC’s George Stephanopolous, Comey came out swinging, describing Donald Trump as “morally unfit” to be president. He also talked about impeachment, the Hillary letter and a president who he says “lies constantly”. Here are the key things we learned:Prime-time television, a medium that Donald Trump understands, is attracting interviewees ready to deliver damning verdicts on the US president. But whereas Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal were describing alleged affairs from years ago, James Comey is the former director of the FBI. As Anderson Cooper of CNN put it: “Somebody who’s actually been in the room with him, seen it from the inside.” And his account to George Stephanopoulos was as brutal as any heard from a former government official talking about an American president: “A person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it: that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds.”• Comey is not afraid to get personal, maybe too personalComey’s recollection of his first meeting with Trump was vivid and colourful, with small details that are perhaps calculated to demonstrate the reliability of his memory. “He looked shorter to me than he did on television, but otherwise exactly the same ... He had impressively coiffed hair, it looks to be all his. I confess, I stared at it pretty closely and my reaction was, ‘It must take a heck of a lot of time in the morning, but it’s impressively coiffed.’ His tie was too long, as it always is. He looked slightly orange up close with small, white, half moons under his eyes, which I assume are from tanning googles.” This is catnip for Never Trumpers, confirming every scornful suspicion, raising a laugh with audiences and selling books. But the insults could also be counterproductive, suggesting Comey is willing roll in the mud with Trump and handing ammunition to his supporters.• Yes, he will talk about prostitutes and the supposed pee tapeWhether motivated by a desire for transparency, animus towards Trump or an eye for publicity, Comey is willing to speak candidly about the so-called Steele dossier, which contained the salacious – and unverified – allegation that the Russian government has video of Trump watching prostitutes urinate on each other in a Moscow hotel room in 2013. Comey recalls that when he first briefed the incoming president on it during the transition, Trump replied: “Do I look like a guy who needs hookers?” And Comey carefully leaves the issue hanging: “I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don’t know whether the current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013. It’s possible, but I don’t know.”• When it comes to the Hillary Clinton letter, he believes he did the right thingMany Hillary Clinton supporters have still not forgiven Comey for his handling of the investigation into the former secretary of state’s use of a private email server. Stephanopoulos challenged: “Your critics say this is where your ego got the best of you. This was your original sin?” Comey is not apologising. He said he was in a “no win” situation. Asked if he would still send the 28 October letter, which announced the FBI was looking back into the Clinton investigation just days before the election, Comey admitted he must have been influenced by the assumption she would win but that he would do it again. “If I ever start considering whose political fortunes will be affected by a decision, we’re done. We’re just another player in the tribal battle.”• Life in the Comey household must have been awkward after the electionEarly in the interview, Comey said he did not vote in the presidential election, explaining: “I’m the director of the FBI. I’m trying to be outside of politics so intentionally tried not to follow it a lot.” But he said his wife, Patrice, and his four daughters all wanted Clinton to win and took part in the 2017 women’s march in Washington the day after Trump’s inauguration. Patrice told Stephanopoulos: “I wanted a woman president really badly, and I supported Hillary Clinton. A lot of my friends worked for her. And I was devastated when she lost.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2cfe2781bc849e8ffc8bfb827d05f569c11a91/0_188_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=5000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=253999986c180b5bbedafbfc2eb6d8fd 10000w","title":"eternal sunshine las vegas perfect winter holiday","story":"From stargazing in the desert to world-famous pool parties, Las Vegas offers something for everyone looking to escape the cold and the rainWhen it’s cold, wet and generally miserable in the UK, why not head to Las Vegas for the flip side: sun, swimming pools and outdoor adventures. Though it’s a few hundred miles from the ocean, you’ll still find beaches, some of which are home to a vibrant daytime party scene. Nearby there are stunning natural wonders — mountains, lakes and hiking trails – perfect for all kinds of recreational activities.

The beach is family friendly, but head to the nearby Toptional Moorea club for a more grown-up experience.Mandalay Bay, 3950 S. Las Vegas Blvd.No need to stop the party just because the sun is shining – Wet Republic supplies the beats, dipping pools and festive atmosphere for all-day clubbing. A-list DJs, including Calvin Harris, Tiësto and Kaskade, keep the party going while there are a range of VIP options — take a bungalow for privacy and a personal jacuzzi, or be right in the action and book a banquette by the dance floor.MGM Grand, 3799 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Pick a pool. Caesars Palace has seven to choose from, each with its own theme. They all feature cabanas and day beds, so be guided by your mood. The Apollo pool receives the most sunlight, while the Jupiter is more secluded.

Bungalow residents get extra luxuries such as a cooling system, infinity pool and, crucially, a private bathroom.Wynn Las Vegas, 3131 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Just a half-hour’s drive from the Strip is Lake Mead, a recreation area known as the most erse in America. Visitors come for year-round activities, including jet skiing, paddleboarding, sport fishing and kayaking. There are a number of picnic spots throughout the park, and for a night away from the city’s hubbub, pitch a tent in one of the 10 campgrounds, or stay at one of the lakeside resorts.The Tank, as the Golden Nugget’s pool is called, can boast what no other can: here you can swim with sharks. Well, almost. An enclosed waterslide plunges nine metres, travelling through an aquarium filled with some 300 sea creatures, including said sharks and sting rays. The H2O bar supplies the drinks, while lounging in the sun is as strenuous as things need to get if you prefer. On the third floor is the Hideout, an infinity pool for over-21s with day beds, chaise lounges and luxury cabanas.Golden Nugget, 129 E. Fremont StreetA visit to the Hoover Dam is on many a bucket list, but to really experience the magnificence of the structure hop in a kayak. As you paddle out into the Colorado River, you’ll have an epic view as the 220-metre (726-foot) dam looms above. A number of companies offer day or half-day tours that take in highlights of the Black Canyon, including sauna caves and geothermal hot springs. Desert bighorn sheep, falcons and bald eagles are some of the wildlife that you might spot. The water is flat and suitable for beginners.The Dayclub is responsible for party duties at The Cosmopolitan in the day time.

There are more than 50 miles of trails to explore, four campgrounds and a range of activities from horseback riding to biking. The Lee Canyon resort offers winter skiing, snowshoeing and tubing, as well as disc golf during the warmer months. Other places to stay nearby include the well-appointed Mt Charleston Las Vegas resort.It might sit atop the Downtown Grand Hotel but the vibe at this pool deck is one of backyard party.

It’s known for its hiking trails (there are 26 numbered hikes), which cater for all levels of fitness and reach from canyon floors to the highest points. A 13-mile paved road provides a scenic drive through stunning desert landscapes other activities include mountain biking, horseback riding and target shooting — it’s also a wonderful spot for stargazing.This luxurious but relaxed resort, away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, has two pools. The M Pool is the family-friendly version it has plenty of seating and cabanas for hire, and there are two large hot tubs on the pool deck.

It is in our national interest to prevent the further use of chemical weapons in Syria and to uphold and defend the global consensus that these weapons should not be used.”She is expected to add: “We have done it because we believed it was the right thing to do. And we are not alone. There is broad-based international support for the action we have taken,”pointing out that she has secured the support of a string of world leaders.May will give a statement to MPs on Monday afternoon, after refusing to recall parliament last week to seek MPs’ approval before action was taken.Her remarks will come after Jeremy Corbyn described the attack on Syria as “both wrong and misconceived”.In an article for the Guardian, the Labour leader said the attack by the west was “either purely symbolic – a demolition of empty buildings, already shown to be entirely ineffective as a deterrent. Or it was the precursor to wider military action. That would risk a reckless escalation of the war and death toll, and the danger of direct confrontation between the US and Russia. Neither possibility offers an end to the war and suffering, or any prospect of saving lives – rather the opposite.”He also took aim at the foreign secretary, saying: “Boris Johnson’s blithe acceptance that the conflict will now continue on its current course and that peace negotiations would be an ‘extra’ is an unconscionable abdication of responsibility and morality.” In further remarks that could prove controversial after the Salisbury poisoning, Corbyn also called for “a shift from the rhetoric of endless confrontation with Russia”, which he said could “help lower the temperature, and make a UN consensus for multilateral action to end Syria’s agony more likely”.The government has also announced that it will urge the Speaker, John Bercow, to grant an emergency debate afterwards, to allow more time to be set aside for MPs to express their views.The debate would be aimed at preempting attempts by Labour and the Scottish National party to force a vote on the decision to trigger action – though Conservative MPs have been issued a three-line whip on Tuesday in case opposition parties succeed.Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused the prime minister of failing to consult parliament because she feared losing a vote. “Theresa May had a chance to try and persuade parliament but bottled out of it through weakness,” he said.May will pledge a further diplomatic push to bring the Assad regime back to the negotiating table in Geneva, and ensure chemical weapons attacks are fully investigated.Senior government ministers were out in force over weekend, seeking to explain the rationale behind the bombing raids, with Johnson insisting they were “timely, appropriate and commensurate”.He said the airstrikes were aimed narrowly at sending a signal to the Syrian regime that the use of chemical weapons was unacceptable – not on seeking to resolve the wider conflict.“There’s one overwhelming reason why this was the right thing to do, and that is to deter the use of chemical weapons, not just by the Assad regime but around the world,” he said, describing the action as a response not only to the Douma attack but repeated use of chemical weapons in Syria in the past few years. “Finally the world has said, enough is enough,” he told BBC1’s the Andrew Marr Show.He added: “It’s important that we understand the limits of what we are trying to do. This is not going to turn the tide of the conflict in Syria one can hope it encourages the Russians to the negotiating table in Geneva, to get a political process properly going – but that is, as it were, an extra. The primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons.”Johnson also stoked fears of reprisals by Russia, saying the UK had to “take every possible precaution” to prepare for possible revenge cyber attacks on targets such as the NHS and electrical facilities. May is expected to face questions from Tory MPs anxious about the potential consequences of Saturday’s raids, the government’s plan for tackling the broader Syrian conflict and the decision to ignore the recent convention of seeking parliament’s approval before military action.Labour backbenchers with a longstanding interest in the Syria conflict, including the Wirral South MP Alison McGovern, are also likely to pursue the question of what more the UK could and should be doing to ensure the safety of civilians."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8241a47c5971917604914feae373ebaf54885a0/66_234_1337_802/master/1337.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=82e683bec083e27128832807e2d46212 1240w","title":"belgium comes to terms with human zoos of its colonial past","story":"Sixty years ago, Belgium set up a live display of people from Congo for the 1958 world fair. Now the country is rethinking that legacySixty years ago on Tuesday, Belgium staged the opening of the 1958 world fair, a glittering 200-day celebration of postwar social, cultural and technological advances.It is said to retain an “important place in the collective memory of the Belgian nation”. A series of events are being held in the Atomium, the futuristic landmark built for the spectacle, in recognition.Yet as the Belgian capital indulges in nostalgia, one exhibit staged at the time is not being revisited: a live display of black men, women and children in “native conditions” laid on for the education and amusement of white Europeans.It was the world’s last “human zoo”.As of 1958, Belgium still ruled Congo, a piece of territory some 80 times its own size, and a source of great pride to the country. The mineral-rich central African state was not only hugely economically rewarding but garlanded Belgium, a small European nation in the shadows of Britain and France, with standing in the world.Expo ’58 was seen by Belgian politicians as a chance to burnish this achievement, sealing what was seen as a special bond with Belgian Congo.At the foot of the Atomium, a rejoinder to Paris’s Eiffel Tower, and the centre piece of the exhibition, eight hectares of land peppered by seven pavilions were dedicated to the themes of mining in Congo, its arts, transport and agriculture, among others. It was known as the Kongorama. In its three hectares of tropical gardens, Congolese men, women and children were put on show day-after-day, in “traditional” dress behind a bamboo perimeter fence.Human zoos were in no way a novelty to the west and had been held regularly earlier in the century in London, Paris, Oslo and Hamburg. In New York in 1906, a young Congolese man with sharpened teeth was given a home in the monkey house in the Bronx zoo.In the summer of 1897, King Leopold II had imported 267 Congolese to Brussels to be on show around his colonial palace in Tervuren, east of Brussels, paddling in their canoes on the royal lakes 1.3 million Belgians, out of a population of 4 million, visited, walking over a rope bridge to get the best view.That summer was bitterly cold and seven of the Congolese died of pneumonia and influenza, their bodies dumped in an unmarked mass grave in the local cemetery. But such was the popularity of the zoo and other exhibits that a permanent exhibition was to be later established at the site. Initially called the Museum of the Congo, it is now the Royal Museum for Central Africa.The 1958 exhibit was smaller in scale, but similar in content. A “typical” village was set up, where the Congolese spent their days carrying out their crafts by straw huts while they were mocked by the white men and women who stood at the edge.“If there was no reaction, they threw money or bananas over the closure of bamboo,” one journalist wrote at the time of the spectators.Another report told of people gossiping about “seeing the negros at the zoological gardens”.The Congolese on display were among 598 people – including 273 men, 128 women and 197 children, a total of 183 families – brought over from Africa to staff the wider fair.The colonial office was “very nervous about what this stay of such an unprecedented number of Congolese in Belgium might do”, according to Dr Sarah Van Beurden, a historian of central Africa.But housed in a dedicated building isolated from the Expo from which they could be bussed in and out, the Congolese complained of cramped accommodation, the strict limitations on visitors or excursions from the building, and, of course, daily abuse at the fair.By July, the Congolese artists and artisans, and their families, could take no more and some went back home. The human zoo, as the Congolese recognised it to be, closed down, and the rest of the fair carried on.Such a zoo was not to be staged anywhere again, and in January 1959, Congo won its independence. But for Guido Gryseels, the director general at the Royal Museum for Central Africa (RMCA), the permanent exhibition that grew from 1897, combating the prejudices that were at the core of the zoo and still, he says, persist, is the focus of his working life.On 1 December, following a €75m renovation, the RMCA will reopen five years after it last opened its doors to the public. There is a new visitors centre and a vast underground space that has doubled the museum’s exhibition area to 11,000 sq metres. But beyond the physical transformation, a much more significant change is about to be undertaken.When Gryseels took over the museum in 2001, the permanent exhibition had barely changed since the 1920s, he said. Along with Leopold II’s double L motifs looking down on visitors in almost every room, and the royal quotations celebrating the higher moral plane of the colonisation, the story that was told was of Belgium bringing light where there was darkness.“For 100 years we have been a colonial institution”, Gryseels said. “For most Belgians their first encounter with Africa is our museum. The initial impression of Africa by most Belgians was made here in this museum, and that is that the white person is better than the black person. We were there to civilise them. The Africans we portray here are naked with a spear without a culture of their own.”A reason for the inertia at the museum, he believes, is that in reality Belgian society has not wanted to rethink its colonial past. “It is very emotional here because every Belgian family has a family member who worked in Congo. All of them. A missionary, a teacher, an administrator. You ask any Belgian and they all have. So it is a very emotional debate.”There are some voices from the Congolese diaspora calling for the “decolonisation” of his institution, and its closure. But Gryseels says his job in the next nine months is to tell a new story about Belgium in the Congo.On the opening day, the minister of foreign affairs is expected to give a speech on Belgium’s colonial past in the presence of the royal family. “We have a responsibility for cultivating an attitude that a lot of Belgians have of being superior to black people”, Gryseels said. “And that is changing. But it is going to take a while.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6538c72f9de112114d1487634da3bbf2cd74cf0/0_23_4192_2517/master/4192.jpg?w=4000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35fff38ee40e6947733a92c7e527b61f 8000w","title":"monday briefing may faces syria aftermath","story":"PM will seek to justify strikes against Assad regime ...

Tess ready to go planet spotting Good morning everyone. Graham Russell here with the news to start your week.Theresa May will today justify her decision to order military strikes on Syria without first seeking parliamentary approval, telling MPs it was in Britain’s interest and was aimed at preventing human suffering. She is expected to point out that “there is broad-based international support for the action we have taken”. The PM will also pledge a further diplomatic push to bring Bashar al-Assad’s regime back to the negotiating table in Geneva, and ensure chemical weapons attacks are fully investigated. Senior government ministers were out in force over the weekend, seeking to explain the rationale behind Saturday’s action, with the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, insisting the missile strikes on chemical weapons facilities were “timely, appropriate and commensurate”.Jeremy Corbyn, in an opinion piece for the Guardian, has said the attack was “legally questionable” and either entirely ineffective as a deterrent or a precursor to wider military action. “Neither possibility offers an end to the war and suffering, or any prospect of saving lives – rather the opposite. The intensification of military action will simply lead to more deaths and more refugees,” he wrote. He also called for the restoration of a UN chemical weapons inspections regime.Across the Channel, Emmanuel Macron has used the strikes to burnish his military credentials, and has even boasted during an interview that he steered Donald Trump on the best action to take in Syria, Trump, the ‘stain’ – James Comey has launched a broadside against Donald Trump’s character, saying he is “morally unfit” to be president, treats women like meat and is a “stain” on everyone who worked for him. The former FBI director – who Trump has variously called a “leaker”, “liar”, “slippery” and a “slimeball” – was giving his first TV interview since the launch of his new book, A Higher Loyalty. Other highlights include Comey’s analysis of Trump’s hair and skin, the difficulty of briefing him on claims he had been in a Moscow hotel room with urinating prostitutes and the decision to reopen the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry. Richard Wolffe writes that Comey helped Trump to power, now he wants to undo the deed.Stephen Lawrence – The father of the teenager stabbed to death 25 years ago in an infamous racially motivated attack has forgiven his son’s killers, saying they had inadvertently “created a legend”. Neville Lawrence said Stephen’s murder in south-east London had sparked debate about racism and policing, and he was now motivated to speak about the recent surge in knife crime. “It is even more urgent now that I talk to these youngsters and explain to them the pain and the suffering they inflict on families,” he said. Danny Leigh spoke to Duwayne Brooks, who was with Stephen Lawrence when he died.The ultimate Tess – An ambitious search for alien worlds begins on Monday, weather permitting, with the launch of Nasa’s planet-hunting spacecraft, Tess. It will be flung into an unprecedented orbit around Earth on one of Elon Musk’s Falcon 9 rockets and spend two years observing 200,000 of the brightest stars in the sky. Alongside other measurements, scientists hope to work out the planets’ masses and densities, and perhaps even the gases in their atmospheres. It will build on the work of the Kepler space telescope, which showed astronomers the Milky Way is home to at least two billion potentially habitable planets. “We think we’ve got a spacecraft that is ready to kick ass,” said Nasa’s Stephen Rinehart.Windrush – A group of Caribbean countries has been snubbed by No 10 in their request to discuss the immigration plight of the Windrush-generation of British residents, some of whom now face the prospect of proving their right to stay in the UK. Some diplomats feel the UK is not taking seriously a problem that is affecting large numbers of long-term UK residents who came to Britain as children. Some have been threatened with deportation to countries they left as children 50 years ago. Others have been denied access to healthcare, lost jobs or been made homeless.Harmony in, homosexuality out – Weibo, China’s Twitter equivalent, has banned “homosexual” content from its platform, saying it wants to create a “harmonious community environment”. The move sparked outcry, mostly under the hashtag #iamgay, with many referring to China’s constitution, which says citizens’ “personal dignity” is “inviolable”. China’s online space has come under increasingly tighter control. In January, authorities ordered Sina Weibo to shut several portals to eliminate “vulgar” or “harmful” online content.Nearly 60 years ago, Belgium staged a glittering 200-day celebration of postwar social, cultural and technological advances. The event, which is said to retain an “important place in the collective memory of the Belgian nation”, is being honoured this week but one of its exhibits not so much – the world’s last “human zoo”. In three hectares of tropical gardens, the colonial power put Congolese men, women and children on show in “traditional” dress behind a bamboo perimeter fence for the education and amusement of white Europeans. They would spend their days carrying out their crafts by straw huts while they were mocked by visitors. “If there was no reaction, they threw money or bananas over the closure,” one journalist wrote at the time. For Guido Gryseels, the head of Belgium’s Royal Museum for Central Africa, combating the prejudices at the core of the zoo remains the focus of his work.Pep Guardiola’s champions will go down in history as one of the best to grace English football, writes Jonathan Wilson. Yes, City outlaid a net £360m under Guardiola but he has also improved players and blended them to accentuate their assets.

The Championship Tour was stopping at Margaret River but heats were cancelled after a man in his 30s was taken to hospital with leg injuries.

The 41-6 win confirms the Sarries’ place in the play-offs for the ninth season in a row. Shares were mixed in Asia after an upbeat start to the week, with Chinese benchmarks hit the most. The missile strikes on Syria appeared to have little impact on trading, with all eyes on Chinese GDP data, due on Tuesday.The pound is buying $1.425 and €1.155.There are two stories in town today, according to the front pages: fears of a Russian “cyber war” on Britain and Manchester City’s triumph over Manchester United.The Mail, Mirror, Telegraph and Express all splash on fears that Moscow will use hackers and trolls to retaliate against the UK for the US-led strikes on Syria over the weekend. Most of the front-page stories quote Boris Johnson saying the UK has to “take every possible precaution” to prepare for possible revenge cyber-attacks on targets such as the NHS and electrical facilities. The fallout from the Syria strikes also makes the FT front, with the paper leading on “Trump vows to follow air strikes with more sanctions on Russia”. The Guardian splashes on the prime minister defending her decision to act: “May hits back at critics: bombing Syria was ‘in our national interest’”, as does the Sun with its lead story: “Back me or back brutality”.Singing a different tune is the Times, which has a story about patients deciding how they spend NHS money as a result of a huge expansion of personal health budgets.For more news: www.theguardian.comThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

The mere sight of the medical bills that can be incurred as a result of an overseas illness would be enough to give you a heart attack.” File photograph: iStockPhotoMore than half of the Irish people who leave this country every year don’t bother with travel insurance.This is despite the fact that it is one of the very few insurance products that has not spiralled in price in recent years, while not having it could easily cost you an arm and a leg and make a difficult situation immeasurably worse.Many of those with private health insurance policies which routinely cover overseas emergency healthcare figure they don’t need it, while those travelling within the EU where public health systems can be readily availed of at no cost are similarly disinclined.But all those who don’t bother packing their travel insurance are making a mistake. The mere sight of the medical bills that can be incurred as a result of an overseas illness would be enough to give you a heart attack, particularly if you are travelling to the US.If you have your appendix removed there, you will be out of pocket by more than €30,000. A minor cardiac event will cost at least €40,000 and a bad heart attack could cost you about €200,000. An angiogram will cost €25,000, and if you have to stay in an intensive care unit you can expect to wake up to a heart-stopping bill of €5,500 per night. An air ambulance to repatriate you could top €100,000.While private health insurance and the benefits of being an EU citizen will take some of the sting out of falling ill, neither will help you if you have to cancel your holiday or curtail it because someone close to you has fallen ill or, heaven forbid, died. Neither will be of much use if you are the victim of a crime while abroad. You will also have to stump up if you or someone you are travelling with needs to be repatriated in a non-conventional way.With all that in mind – and ahead of the start of the summer holidays – we thought we’d draw up a list of dos and don’ts when it comes to sorting out your travel insurance.1. Do take out your out travel insurance as soon as you book your trip, or take on an annual multi-trip policy if you are planning to take more than two trips overseas in any given year. A significant number of claims are down to changing family circumstances or a bereavement, and you have no idea when such things will happen.In an analysis of its own claims data since 2012, AA Travel Insurance found that on average, 30 per cent of claims made each year are lodged as a result of the holiday-goer needing to cancel or curtail their holiday pre-departure.“It’s very easy to fall into the trap of assuming you only need travel insurance while you’re actually abroad and leaving it until the very last minute before your departure to purchase cover,” says the AA’s Conor Faughnan. “Unfortunately, taking that approach can prove exceptionally risky as you could be left with a significant hole in your wallet if you’re forced to cancel your holiday at short notice for any reason.”2. Don’t take out a policy sold by tour operators, as they tend to be a lot more expensive than those sourced elsewhere. If you are booking a holiday with a tour operator you might be told that you will get additional peace of mind if you book the insurance with the tour operator also, as their reps overseas will have all the details of your policy should things go wrong. But in an era of digital communications, you should be able to access all the documentation you need handily enough on your smartphone.3. Do declare any pre-existing conditions that you have when taking out a policy, as you do not want to give the insurer any excuse not to pay out in the event that you fall ill as a result of that condition. And remember that if you have the results of serious tests or investigations hanging over you, it might be advisable to let the insurer know there is an issue. If you don’t, a subsequent claim could be rejected. If you have health insurance that includes medical cover when overseas, you will most likely not have to pay any additional premium for many pre-existing conditions.4. Don’t ignore the small print. Look at the size of the excesses and the exclusions. Insurance companies don’t get rich by giving money away and they sometimes do their best to make claims as hard as they possibly can. They also make the benefits of their policies crystal clear and hide the exclusions in very small print. For instance, phones are not covered in many cases, while other valuables can lose their cover if they are not with you at all times. And, if you hadn’t been storing your passport in a hotel safe when it is stolen, you can almost certainly forget about making a claim for its theft from your hotel room.5. Do use this handy trick. The documentation attached to a normal travel insurance policy is more than 15,000 words. The dense, dull prose makes it almost impossible to read. Rather than reading it in full, download a PDF version or copy the text into Microsoft Word and search for “not covered”, “excluded” and “exclusions”. At least that will give you a sense of what not covered by your policy.6. Don’t forget your European Health Insurance Card (Ehic). If you are travelling in Europe, it gives you access to public health services at no cost and, as most of the countries in the EU have a better public health system than we do, you should never worry about using it. If you have a smartphone, download the Ehic app to help you navigate overseas health systems. Remember, your card needs to be renewed every five years. And don’t ever pay for the card. Some sites will try charging for the service, but it is free through the official site, ehic.ie7. Do remember that some companies will reject any claim for a cancellation or curtailment if it is down to a pre-existing condition, even if the condition endures for years. So if you have an elderly close relative who was diagnosed with a serious illness several years previously and they pass away or become gravely ill while you are overseas, the cost of returning home may not be covered.8. Don’t forget to tell the police if you are the victim of a crime overseas. If you do not have a police report, you will not be entertained by an insurer. You will also need to make the official complaint quickly. If you leave a police report for longer than 24 hours, an insurance company might view your claim with scepticism.9. Do take a photograph of your passport and email it to yourself before you leave home. If it is stolen, having all the details on your phone makes it easier to get an emergency replacement. The reason you need to email it is to cover yourself in case the phone is stolen too.10. Don’t expect your insurance to cover natural disasters and the like. Some of the cheaper policies do not cover travel rearrangement expenses, accommodation and cancellations relating to “natural disasters” outside of weather disruption. If you want travel disruption cover, you will have to pay more for it, although not a whole lot – and such an add-on might only cost €15.“No doubt you know that Intana in Kilkenny run VHI Travel Claims,” started a mail from a reader called Mary. We’re not going to lie, we did not know that. But that is neither here nor there. Mary phoned them “a few days after my consultation with my GP and asked for a claim form, which arrived the next day. When I was speaking with the Intana staff member they asked me a few questions, nothing intrusive – their main concern (and I fully appreciate this) is that I was “well and stable” when I made my bookings – and they sincerely wished me well in my recovery.”Throughout February and March she phoned VHI MultiTrip multiple times with various queries about their form. “Each staff member I spoke to was professional, helpful and kind – which is so so important to me, as I am unwell. At one stage I phoned and asked to speak to their centre manager, and congratulated him on the service from his staff. I nominate each and every one of the staff I have spoken to for customer service people of the year. My premium with VHI MultiTrip is €58 .... I would pay 10 times that for the kindness I’ve received from the Intana staff.”What we give with one hand, we take away with the other. Catherine O’Flynn and husband both have VHI health cover. Their son has an international policy as he lives in the UK, and all three are long-standing VHI members.“I have had multi-travel insurance over many years with different companies – Woodchester, ” she says. Not long ago she set up a multi-trip policy with the VHI’s travel insurance department. “I assumed I was getting travel insurance, such as I had held over many years. Thats not how it has worked out.”She and her husband travelled to Rome on February 22nd and were due to return to Dublin on March 1st. Their flight home with Aer Lingus was cancelled as a result of the great snow – and rescheduled for four days later.“We are organised people, and decided to phone the VHI travel insurance department, expecting routine advice on how to claim for the four extra nights in the hotel and expenses for the extra unwanted period of time. We were quite simply stunned to be told that essentially, this is a health multi-trip policy with a payment of €40 for first number of hours and then €15 per day after that, a pittance.”She rang the VHI a second time to complain about what she believes is the mis-selling of a product. “We happened to come across several Irish people ‘stranded’ in Rome who were quite confident their lovely VHI multi-trip policy would cover their hotel and expenses arising from the extra stay.“A barrister friend has just told me he rang VHI MultiTrip, as he is travelling shortly and he, like us, had laboured under the impression he actually had travel insurance. He is making alternative arrangements for a trip coming up shortly. He rang because we told him of our dreadful experience with VHI MultiTrip travel insurance.”When we contacted the VHI, a spokeswoman said that as with many travel insurance policies, weather events that are sometimes referred to as an act of God are typically not covered by policies. She said cancellation and curtailment, crime and other elements of cover found in other policies were also contained within the VHI travel insurance policy.A couple of weeks ago, Pricewatch attended a Senior Times expo in Cork. The event was dedicated to things of interest to an older audience. One of the things that came up more than once was the difficulty many older people have in getting travel insurance. The refrain we heard repeatedly was that people are living longer and staying healthy for longer, and just because they hit a certain arbitrary age they don’t feel like their horizons should be shortened by outside forces.But too often they are.Ageism is rife in the travel insurance sector. Someone who tries to get travel insurance at 66 can often pay twice as much as someone aged 65, even though there is no difference in the level of risk the two people pose to companies. Someone who hits 70 or 75 will be told they can’t get any insurance at all with many companies.The European Court of Justice ruled that it was discriminatory and illegal to price car insurance based on gender a few years back, but no such restrictions apply when it comes to a person’s age.Companies can just refuse to offer a quote for someone once they hit a certain age, and there is no comeback.Meanwhile, there are companies that make it their business to offer travel insurance to older people. There is oktotravelinsurance.ie and goodtogoinsurance.eu, which you most likely will never have heard of, and the AA, which you most certainly will have heard of, while the VHI covers most of the travelling public in Ireland aged between 70 and 80.There can be restrictions on pre-existing conditions, and many insurers will insist policy-holders have private medical insurance. Age Action Ireland has a comprehensive list of the companies that insure older people - although it does make it clear that it is endorsing none of the companies and as with most things it is very important that you do your homework and are sure you are getting what you are paying for before you agree to anything.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3463103.1523864258!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"weather to become wetter before it gets better","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrollies out: A rainfall warning has been issued by Met Éireann.

In a carefully worded statement on the air strikes over the weekend, the Department of Foreign Affairs, where Mr Coveney is Minister, said when chemical attacks such as that on Douma were mounted, it was “natural” to respond with deterrent action.The spokesman for the department stopped short of expressly supporting the action, mounted by the US, France and the UK. “There are no good answers on how to address the horrible situation in Syria,” he said.“When something like this happens, it is natural to want to take action to ensure that it doesn’t happen again.”He said Ireland continued to urge caution by all parties. “The Syria conflict ultimately requires a political solution that is the only way to bring peace,” he said.The spokesman said Ireland was very strong and clear in condemning the use of chemical weapons. “We were horrified by the attacks in Douma just over a week ago,” he said.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462521.1523809556!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu foreign ministers may tone down support for syria strike","story":"More chemical attacks in Syria will not be tolerated and the U.S. is prepared to strike again according to US Vice President Mike Pence, who added his voice to the chorus of warnings to Syria.

Photograph: AP PhotoHassan AmmarThe EU’s unequivocal support for Saturday’s missile strikes on Syria is likely to be somewhat muted on Monday when foreign ministers meet in Luxembourg, as concerns emerge about the strength of a statement issued on Saturday.Ireland is expected to be among a number of states likely to express concerns, according to diplomatic sources.Among other member states there are worries about the legality of the strike without UN approval, and about the categorical attribution of responsibility to Syria ahead of reports from Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) teams on the ground.US president Donald Trump’s statement that the US is ready to “strike again” should Syria resume chemical attacks will also raise questions about whether the union is giving the three countries a blank cheque for similar future actions.Irish sources were adamant that there was no ision whatsoever about the need to deter chemical attacks and that Bashir al-Assad’s regime was involved in wholesale slaughter of its own people. They said that the evidence showed that it was “overwhelmingly likely” that the Syrians carried out the attacks in Douma. Ireland would not be seeking to condemn the US, UK and French attacks, they said.On Saturday morning, on behalf of the EU28, high representative for foreign policy Federica Mogherini had reiterated the union’s condemnation of “the repeated use of chemical weapons” by the Syrian regime, and said that the union “is supportive of all efforts aimed at the prevention of the use of chemical weapons”.“In this context,” the statement adds, “the EU was informed about targeted US, French and UK air strikes on chemical weapons facilities in Syria, these specific measures having been taken with the sole objective to prevent further use of chemical weapons and chemical substances as weapons by the Syrian regime to kill its own people”.The EU imposed additional sanctions on high-level officials and scientists for their role in developing and using chemical weapons in July 2017 last month, Ms Mogherini said, warning that the union “is always ready to consider imposing further measures as appropriate”.Although unwilling to participate in the attacks, German chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday the military intervention was “necessary and appropriate to ensure the effectiveness of the international ban of chemical weapons use and to warn the Syrian regime of further violations”.She also accused Russia of repeatedly blocking an independent investigation in the UN.Ministers will on Monday approve conclusions on Syria which emphasise the abhorrence and illegality of chemical weapons use, the need for renewed commitment for a political settlement through the “Geneva process”, that there can be no “military solution”, demand humanitarian access and access for OPCW inspectors, and make clear that the union is willing to make a commitment to assisting reconstruction as long as it is the context of a political settlement.Monday’s foreign ministers’ agenda also includes related discussions on Iran and Russia.The EU is particularly concerned about the expected repudiation by the Trump administration on May 12th of the Iran nuclear deal and its likely destabilising impact on the region. The EU would remain committed to its implementation but there are concerns Iran might also repudiate the accord.Several member states are pushing for new measures against Iran over its unrelated ballistic missile programme and its involvement in regional conflicts like Yemen and Syria.\u0026nbspAdditional sanctions are being mooted by the EU in part at least as a way of showing the US the union’s seriousness about Iran and to suggest that the scrapping of the nuclear deal is not the best or only way to handle them. Currently these are being opposed by Sweden, Italy and Austria.The ministers’ conclusions will point to the repeated insistence from International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors that the Iranian are adhering to their obligations not to enrich uranium.The European Parliament will hold a plenary debate on the Syria strikes on Monday in Strasbourg.Read full coverage of events hereThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462566.1523813034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps could delay brexit with final deal renegotiation demand","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople’s Vote: the MPs Caroline Lucas, Layla Moran, Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry want a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPGettyMPs could delay Brexit if they are unhappy with a final deal by sending the British government back to Brussels to renegotiate it, according to a new analysis of the role of parliament in the process.A report by the Institute for Government, a think tank close to Whitehall, rejects the assertion by Theresa May’s government that MPs will face a choice between endorsing the deal or leaving the EU with no agreement at all.“The government has a massive political incentive to talk up the chaos that would ensue if parliament did anything other than approve its deal. It is not surprising, therefore, to hear ministers arguing that the only alternative is to leave the EU without a deal – meaning no transition period and no legal guarantees for UK and EU citizens,” said Raphael Hogarth, one of the report’s authors.“The facts, however, are messier. If parliamentarians object to a particular bit of the deal, or to all of it, they could ask the government to renegotiate. The real questions then would be political: could the present government survive this, and would the EU 27 be prepared to return to the table?”The UK and the EU hope to reach agreement by October on two major documents outlining the terms of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the union and its future relationship with the European Union.The withdrawal agreement, a treaty setting out the terms of the UK’s exit for the short to medium term, will have the force of international law once it is signed and ratified. The second document is the “framework for a future relationship”, a political declaration on the terms of the UK’s long-term relationship with the EU.The government has promised to put the withdrawal agreement and future framework, together, to a “meaningful vote” in parliament. If the motion is approved it will be followed by a Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill, which will enshrine the agreement in British law.The Institute for Government report says that, although MPs will not be able to amend the withdrawal agreement itself, they can attach amendments to the “meaningful vote” motion obliging the government to seek a better deal.“MPs can force ministers back to the negotiating table and, if they do, the government’s timetable could be unachievable. If MPs were to send ministers back to Brussels to ask for significant changes to the deal, it is likely that Brexit would have to be delayed,” said Hannah White, another of the report’s authors.More than 1,000 people attended the launch in London on Sunday of the People’s Vote, a campaign to put the Brexit deal to the people in a referendum. MPs from four parties were at the launch, including the Conservative Anna Soubry, Chuka Umunna of Labour, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas and the Liberal Democrat Layla Moran.“We have got to get a majority in the House of Commons for the proposition of this people’s vote,” Mr Umunna said. “That means at the very least my party, the Labour Party, needs to be true to its values and support this.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462394.1523798421!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"washington we need an exorcist","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Exorcist: William Friedkin at the steps where he filmed his horror film’s climatic scene, in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington. Photograph: Gabriella DemczukNew York TimesWhen you’ve got a demonic child in Washington splattering dark stinking bile, croaking gibberish, spewing vulgar personal attacks, lying to sow confusion, whining about the unfairness of the attempts of righteous men to compel the diabolical behaviour and head-spinning outbursts to stop, who do you call? The demon-buster himself, of course: William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist.Before Donald Trump became president the most frightening thing that happened in the US capital was The Exorcist, which brags on its DVD cover that it’s the scariest film of all time. It could well be, if the measure is moviegoers putting down their popcorn in unison when Linda Blair gushes green vomit. “That was oatmeal – the pea soup was just for colouring,” the 82-year-old Friedkin tells me as we have lunch at 1789 in Georgetown, Washington, a restaurant opposite the steep concrete steps where Jason Miller’s tortured Fr Karras fell to his death in a violent struggle with the demon.Friedkin offers an eerie connection to the Trump White House, noting that he edited the film at 666 Fifth Avenue, the accursed Manhattan building with the Number of the Beast at the centre of Jared Kushner’s money problems. The book and screenplay were written by William Peter Blatty, inspired by a news story he heard about in a religious class: the 1949 case of a 14-year-old boy in a Maryland suburb of Washington.Objects appeared to move around on their own in the boy’s bedroom, and he was violent and speaking Latin phrases. The boy, a Lutheran who grew up to be an engineer at Nasa, underwent an exorcism, first with a priest from Georgetown University and then with priests in St Louis.After studying up on the case Friedkin has decided it was “jive”. “It just doesn’t hold water,” he says, eating asparagus soup that looks enough like what came out of Linda Blair’s mouth to make me a little queasy.Friedkin’s career peaked in the early 1970s with The Exorcist and another blockbuster, The French Connection. Eventually he felt so out of touch with a Hollywood possessed by comic books and sci-fis that he began directing operas. Now he has returned to the subject that haunts him with a documentary called The Devil and Father Amorth, opening this month.Friedkin used a handheld camera to film an interview with Fr Amorth, the chief Vatican exorcist, who worried that “Satan rules the world” and was in the Vatican. He died in 2016, at 91. The director, who had never seen an exorcism, also talked the priest into letting him film the exorcism of an Italian architect named Christina with whom he had done the ancient ritual many times.“It was harrowing,” Friedkin says. “These five strong guys are holding her down. They’re sweating. Fr Amorth told me that during one of the exorcisms she accused him of his sins and they were real.”Friedkin took this footage to neurosurgeons and psychiatrists, and one psychiatrist challenged it, saying Christina did not show “the classic symptoms” of possession, such as her head turning 360 degrees and her body levitating.“I said, ‘Doctor, we made that up,’” Friedkin recalls dryly. “Blatty invented what we think of as possession and exorcism today, and I had to find a way to film it. Fr Amorth never encountered stuff like that, but he encountered other extraordinary occurrences and personality changes and voice changes. But there was no levitation or head spinning.”The film-maker says that for his documentary he did nothing to amplify the guttural growl of Christina, which evokes the terrifying voice used by Mercedes McCambridge, which was dubbed in for Blair’s in the possession scenes.“When she breathed into the mic you’d hear five or six sounds come out at once, like John Coltrane playing the sax,” he says. “When I first called her she said, ‘I’m in AA. I had a serious drinking problem. I am a lapsed Catholic, but I still have strong ties to the church. So in order to do what you want I’m going to have to start drinking Jack Daniel’s again and smoking cigarettes and eating raw eggs.’ And she wanted to have her own two priests with her at all times.”Friedkin is chock-a-block with such tales. He says the first of his four wives, Jeanne Moreau, installed a lifelong love of Proust in him by reading it aloud. Happily married to Sherry Lansing for 26 years, Friedkin says, he wasn’t really “Hollywood’s most combustible director”, as the Telegraph once called him. “I don’t drink,” he says. “I’ve never done drugs. I’ve never tried grass. But I think Miles Davis is a reason to live.”He does cop to slapping a couple of people to get the sad and angry performances he wanted, noting that another word for director is “manipulator”.He did not want Gene Hackman to play the iconic New York police detective Popeye Doyle in The French Connection. He gave the role to Jimmy Breslin instead. “He had exactly the look I had in mind, a Black Irishman,” Friedkin says.“The first day he was great, great, great. The second day he forgot what he did on the first day. The third day he didn’t show up. Comes Friday he shows up and says, ‘Hey, isn’t there a car chase in this movie?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ He said, ‘You know, I promised my mother on her deathbed I wouldn’t drive, so I don’t know how to drive.’ I said, ‘You’re fired.’ ”He gave Hackman the part, and they sparred so much during filming that at the end he told a producer: “I may get away with this thing, but if I had to do The Gene Hackman Story I wouldn’t hire this guy.” He acknowledges now that Hackman is one of the greatest American film actors.After lunch Friedkin makes me descend the Stairway to Hell, the 75 steps in the movie’s climactic scene that I had avoided my whole life. I saw The Exorcist on my 21st birthday and was so unnerved I went to bed and missed my own party.Standing on the steps, Friedkin channels the demon, growling, “Your mother still rots in hell, Karras, you faithless slime.” Tourists taking selfies on the stairs look around, startled. And even all these years later I still want to crawl under the covers. – New York TimesThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

He strikes me as a person of above average intelligence who’s tracking conversations and knows what’s going on. I don’t think he’s medically unfit to be president. I think he’s morally unfit to be president.\u0026quotA person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it — that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds.\u0026quot \u0026quotPossibly. I mean, it\u0027s certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice. It would depend and-- and I\u0027m just a witness in this case, not the investigator or prosecutor, it would depend upon other things that reflected on his intent.\u0026quot Everything we know so far about James Comey\u0027s bombshell book\u0026quotI didn\u0027t ask about the business with the prostitutes, but he launched into an explanation as to how I should know that wasn\u0027t true and that he remembered now, from talking to friends who had been with him, that he\u0027d never stayed overnight at the hotel, he\u0027d just changed clothes there and went to the Miss Universe pageant.\u0026quotI don\u0027t know whether any of this true, but this is what he said. And then went right back without staying overnight. And then he said, \u0027Another reason you know it\u0027s not true is I\u0027m a germaphobe. There\u0027s no way I\u0027d let people pee on each other around me.\u0027 And that me caught me so much by surprise I actually let out an audible laugh and - \u0027cause it was just one of those - I was startled by it.\u0026quotAnd - and I remember thinking, \u0027ell, should I say that, \u0027As I understand the activity sir, it doesn\u0027t require an overnight stay. And given that it was allegedly the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton, I would imagine you could be at a safe distance from the activity -\u0027 all these things are bouncing around my head. But instead of saying it, it just led me to think, \u0027The world\u0027s gone crazy.\u0027\u0026quotMr Comey was fired by Mr Trump in May last year\u0026quotI think it\u0027s possible. I don\u0027t know. These are more words I never thought I\u0027d utter about a president of the United States, but it\u0027s possible.\u0026quot \u0026quotI’m not trying to, by the way, suggest that President Trump is out breaking legs and — you know, shaking down shopkeepers. But instead, what I’m talking about is that leadership culture constantly comes back to me when I think about my experience with the Trump administration. The — the loyalty oaths, the boss as the dominant center of everything, it’s all about how do you serve the boss, what’s in the boss’s interests. It’s the family, the family, the family, the family. That’s why it reminds me so much and not, \u0027So what’s the right thing for the country and what are the values of the institutions that we’re dealing with?\u0027\u0026quot Rob Crilly: James Comey\u0027s cheap shots prove he was unfit to lead the FBI\u0026quotI say that in my book cause I’m trying to be honest, cause that’s the truth there had been all this controversy and mocking about hand size, I can’t remember the details. But as I shook his hand I made a note to check the size and it seemed like he had average-sized hands.\u0026quotA Higher Loyalty is published on Tuesday\u0026quotThat is the question that people have to ask themselves. And-- and there\u0027s no easy way to define it in the abstract, that you-- the challenge of this president is that he will stain everyone around him. And the question is, how much stain is too much stain and how much stain eventually makes you unable to accomplish your goal of protecting the country and serving the country? So I don\u0027t know. And it would be hard for anybody to answer that. But everyone\u0027s gotta answer that inidually.\u0026quotGirl seen in hospital video of Syria \u0026#39chemical attack\u0026#39 speaks of ordealHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is the most expensive Broadway play ever stagedNorth Korea warns UK against ‘act of war’ after Royal Navy deployed to enforce sanctionsPrimary school offer day 2018: Parents \u0026#39faking marriage breakdowns\u0026#39 to get children into top primary schoolsAylesbury prison riot: Young offenders trash wing and throw paint in protest at \u0026#39lack of showers\u0026#39Airstrikes \u0026#39hit parts but not the heart\u0026#39 of arsenal, says Syria\u0026#39s former chemical weapons chiefFamily of Hither Green burglar stopped by police from pinning birthday tributes to fence near his victim\u0026#39s homeThe Queen\u0026#39s Green Planet: the monarch\u0026#39s ambitious plan to turn the Commonwealth into a forestOrdeal By Innocence: 10 major differences between the book and the BBC series James Comey: \u0026#39Donald Trump is morally unfit to be president and treats women like pieces of meat\u0026#39Fire in tower block sends dozens fleeing for safety in Stratford, east LondonSir Patrick Stewart says his X-Men and Star Trek characters would have opposed BrexitEmmanuel Macron: France persuaded Donald Trump not to give up on SyriaStarbucks apologises as outrage grows at arrest of two black men while they waited for friendSpring could be over \u0026#39in blink of eye\u0026#39 so enjoy blooms while you can, says Royal Horticultural SocietyVictorian women wore \u0026#39convertible skirts\u0026#39 so they could ride bikes without abuse, academic findsTaking paracetamol during pregnancy may make grandchildren infertile, research suggestsSmall cars more likely to be vandalised, figures suggestMarket trader banned from yelling about his wares because he shouts as loud as a chainsawBoy, 16, charged with murder after the body of a 14-year-old girl was found in a parkWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/16/16/nurses.jpg","title":"student nurses loans overpayment damian hinds royal college nursing rcn","story":"‘The risk of receiving a reduced payment,\u0026nbspor no payment at all, will compromise their ability to study. Students are considering discontinuing due to\u0026nbspthe financial pressures’The education secretary has been urged to take immediate action after hundreds of student nurses had their loans and grants cut off or reduced due to administrative errors.Trade unions and professional bodies have called on Damian Hinds to “urgently intervene” to ensure the affected students at 20 universities receive the loans they had budgeted for next term.More than 800 students have been told they were paid too much money by the Student Loans Company (SLC), the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has said – and they were told that upcoming payments were to be reduced or stopped to recover the sums. Loan error will leave student nurses unable to pay rent, union saysOverpayments of between £600 and £6,000 were made in error – and now some students are saying that a withdrawal of financial support could result in them dropping out of university.Last month, one nursing student, from the University of West London, said she was “worried sick” about being left without enough money to pay the rent, buy food and pay for travel to university.A new letter to the minister, coordinated by the RCN, says the union continues to receive a “huge volume of calls” from “worried and distressed students” due to the ongoing situation.It warns: “A sudden withdrawal of payments will have disastrous consequences for these students, who budget on a term-by-term basis according to loan and grant forecasts.“Many have families and children they will be unable to support if they do not receive additional income in the spring term.”The RCN – joined by Unison and the National Union of Students (NUS) – has called on the education secretary to “write off overpayments in the long term for these students.”The letter says: “We are writing to ask you to take urgent action to ensure healthcare students in England and Wales affected by errors made by the SLC will receive their anticipated payment of support in spring, as they had budgeted for.“We also ask that you use the power at your discretion as education secretary to write off overpayments in the long term for these students.”The letter warns: “Our student members are telling us that the risk of receiving a reduced payment, or no payment at all, will compromise their ability to continue studying.“In some cases, we are hearing concerning reports from inidual students who are considering discontinuing due to these financial pressures.”Student news in picturesStudent news in picturesSouth Korean policemen detain student protestors during a

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices.

It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Yes, that’s about where we are.“The government is listening on the important aspects of the bill and I think that’s what the overall tone of the debate from the crossbenchers will be – that, actually, the government is listening and taking appropriate action.“But there was always going to be a time when this type of amendment, the customs union amendment, was going to cause a bit of a clash. We’ll just have to see how the debate goes.”In advance of Wednesday, Brexit minister Lord Callanan has tabled a small number of government amendments in response to earlier debates, but Tory insiders have been at pains to underline how they are technical in nature and do not “compromise” on the major principles of the Bill, with Conservative right-wingers keeping a close eye on proceedings.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017.

The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017.

US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017.

He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections.

Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFireworks are set off as the final performance takes place during the Closing Ceremony for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.The wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre compound in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, after the United States, UK and France launched strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime early on April 14 in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack after mulling military action for nearly a week.

He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.

Bangladesh has given Myanmar a list of more than 8,000 refugees to begin the repatriation, but the return has been delayed by a complicated verification process. The two countries agreed in December to begin repatriating the refugees in January, but there were concerns among aid workers and Rohingya that they would be forced to return and face unsafe conditions in Myanmar. Hundreds of Rohingya were reportedly killed in the recent violence, and many houses and villages burnt to the ground. The United Nations and the US have described the army crackdown as “ethnic cleansing”. On Friday, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and Bangladesh finalised a memorandum of understanding that describes the repatriation process as “safe, voluntary and dignified ... in line with international standards”. Photos ‘show dozens of burned Muslim villages being bulldozed’The UNHCR said it considers that “conditions in Myanmar are not yet conducive for returns to be safe, dignified and sustainable. The responsibility for creating such conditions remains with the Myanmar authorities, and these must go beyond the preparation of physical infrastructure to facilitate logistical arrangements.” Earlier in the week, Myanmar social welfare minister Win Myat Aye met with about 40 Rohingya refugees at the Kutupalong camp in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh for more than an hour, sometimes exchanging heated words. A Rohingya leader, Abdur Rahim, said at least eight rape victims were among the group.Mr Rahim said the group presented 13 demands for the government to meet for their return to Myanmar. Rohingya refugees – in picturesRohingya refugees – in picturesA young girl and a baby wade through mud after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh from Burma on 10 SeptemberRohingya refugees walk through a camp in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh after arriving from BurmaA young Rohingya refugee gathers firewood after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh from BurmaRohingya refugees wait for sacks of rice to be distributed in Whaikhyang, BangladeshRohingya Muslim refugees arrive on a boat in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh after crossing from Burma on 8 SeptemberRohingya Muslim refugees react after being re-united with each other after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh on a boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees walk along the remains of a road after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh on a boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees wade through water after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees wade through water after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from Myanmar Rohingya Muslim refugees stand in the rain after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from BurmaIndian children hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the alleged persecution of the Rohingya Muslims in BurmaSupporters of the Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC), an Islamic organisation, listen to their leaders\u0027 speeches against Burma\u0027s persecution of Rohingya Muslims, during a demonstration in KarachiHundreds of Iranians take part in a protest against violence in Myanmar after weekly Friday prayers, in TehranIndonesian Muslim activists hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the alleged persecution of the Rohingya minority in Magelang, Central Java, IndonesiaMembers of an Islamic organisation shout slogans against the Burma government during a protest in Dhaka, BangladeshThe refugees apparently became angry when told they must accept national verification cards provided by Myanmar that state they are migrants from Bangladesh. Rohingya Muslims have long been treated as outsiders in Myanmar, even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. They are denied freedom of movement and other basic rights. Mr Rahim said they demanded to be recognised as citizens of Myanmar before the repatriation starts and that their security arrangements be supervised by the UN. Rohingya who have been repatriated in the past after previous refugee exoduses have been forced to live in camps in Myanmar. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
