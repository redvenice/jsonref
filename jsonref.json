His team piled in with blankets to put him out – but he still lost an eyebrow and some of his moustache’Storm Thorgerson and I had created most of the artwork for Pink Floyd’s albums, including Dark Side of the Moon. One day we were asked to Abbey Road Studios to listen to tracks from the band’s new record. The lyrics were mostly about absence, and the album’s title, Wish You Were Here, was a reference to Syd Barrett, who had left the band some years earlier due to issues with LSD. They were also making a statement about record company executives who regarded musicians as money-making machines, demanding one hit song after another – an\u0026nbspabsence of\u0026nbspa different kind.I went to Los Angeles to find a Hollywood stuntman. The photograph was taken on the Warner Bros back lot in Burbank with Ronnie Rondell, the guy on fire, shaking hands with another stuntman, Danny Rogers. I explained to Ronnie what I needed and he said: “It’s dangerous for a man to stand still on fire. Normally, you’re running and the fire’s spreading behind you, or you’re falling and the fire is above you, or you can always make out with camera angles that the stunt person is closer to the fire than they really are, but to stand still …?” He was very reluctant, but eventually agreed.\u0026nbspI had a suit and wig made that were soaked in flame retardant, Ronnie was covered in this gel – it was like napalm – and his team set him on fire. We repeated the process 14 times, took the shot, and then on the 15th a gust of wind blew up and wrapped the fire around his face and burnt him. He threw himself to the ground and his whole team piled on blankets to put him out. He said: “That’s it! I’m done!” However, I had captured the shot successfully on that last take. Ronnie was very gracious about it considering he had lost an eyebrow and some of his moustache, but as far as he was concerned as a professional in the movie industry it was all in a day’s work.I knew I had got a special picture. It took a long time to persuade Ronnie to stand exactly as I wanted but in the end he was very brave and it was a perfect composition. Years afterwards Ronnie said his only regret was most people know him more for the Pink Floyd album cover than the famous fire stunts he had performed in movies such as The Towering Inferno.Back in London, Storm suggested to the band that we should not give away the front cover picture quite so easily and if the album is really about absence we should make the cover photograph absent too. So we shrink-wrapped the whole package in black plastic. When it was released people had no idea what the album cover looked like. Some would tear off the plastic wrapping and throw it away, while others would carefully cut it open with a surgical knife, extract the vinyl and keep the package intact. It felt like Christmas – you are given something, you rip off the paper, which is physical and tactile, and when you open it up there’s a present inside.Album covers were important in those days. They were signposts to what the band was all about, because you didn’t have MTV, or Spotify or YouTube, and only four or five music papers and maybe a couple of weekly TV pop shows were available to fans.With Pink Floyd, I always seem to get into some scrape or other. At Roger Waters’ request I flew a giant inflatable pig over Battersea power station for Pink Floyd’s Animals cover, but it escaped into the flightpath of planes flying into Heathrow airport. It could have caused an aviation disaster – thank God it didn’t. We managed to retrieve the pig and rephotograph the shot again the next day, and the photograph looked fabulous in the end.The image of the band was not a priority for Hipgnosis. What we did care about was creating an eye-catching idea that would be visually and intellectually stimulating but was not necessarily related to the lyrics or the title of the album.\u0026nbspWe enjoyed creating designs that were visual puns or stories with photographs so when people looked carefully they could decide what the picture was about for themselves. Hipgnosis never gave explanations for our work, and like a mystery novel, a man on fire shaking hands was a conundrum to be solved.\u0026nbspTraining: The London School of Film Technique.High point: “A picture we did very early on for a band called the Nice. It was a picture of 40 red footballs in the Sahara desert.”Low point: “Doing a photograph that you really think’s going to turn into something great, and it’s a piece of shit. And sometimes there’s no explanation for that.” Top tip: “You have to network, have acumen, and be street-smart about how you’re going to develop this career and be something.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c74ac70b240db4882ddd772da6ab5bca5737ba4/150_234_3150_1889/master/3150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52e2ebc80dc2d57223905242db63261c","title":"black excellence stars of afropunk in pictures","story":"Since 2005, Afropunk has celebrated the music, fashion and beatboxing of black artists – and seen the crowd swell to 70,000.

Xu Weiping, a Chinese multimillionaire, has a vision for the future of office work in the post-Covid-19 pandemic world: thousands of office pods where each person works in their own self-contained 3m x 3m cube.Xu reckons the coronavirus pandemic will have such a fundamental impact on the way people work that he is converting 20 newly constructed office buildings in east London into 2,000 of the inidual cube offices.If the cubes, which feature a kettle, fridge, microwave, videoscreen and fold-down bed as well as a chair and desk, prove popular Xu plans to convert all of his £1.7bn 35-acre regeneration project in east London into more than 10,000 of the inidual cubes.Xu’s Advanced Business Parks (ABP) company had spent years negotiating a deal to redevelop the Royal Albert Docks, which overlooks London City airport in Docklands. The development was finally approved in 2015 by the then prime minister, David Cameron, and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who toasted the deal at a lavish ceremony at Mansion House.The project was, Xu said, very popular, with potential tenants agreeing to rent more than half the 21 buildings constructed in the first phase of the development. But then the coronavirus struck, and just one tenant – automation technology firm Advantech UK – has moved in.The pandemic is the latest in a long list of setbacks for the Royal Albert Docks project, which has also been hit by Brexit, delays to the Crossrail transport project (which will have a station at the nearby ExCel Centre) and worsening Sino-British relations.Xu said he has spent every day since the pandemic struck thinking of ways to secure the future of the development. “I realised that we might have to be prepared for the fact that the virus might stay with us for a long time,” Xu said in translated interview over Zoom. “We will have to create an environment where we can work safely and reduce exposure to public transport and increase happiness in working.”His answer is the inidual office, where colleagues and freelancers can work close to one another but mostly safely self-contained in their own pods. “We believe this is the first of its kind in the UK or even the whole world,” Xu said. “It will completely change the office environment.”Xu said the cubes are designed to combine the best parts of working from home with the amenities and collaboration of a traditional office. “The cube is an inidual space enjoyed by just one person,” he said. “Inside this cube, the person can do their work but also have a rest and relax. The cube is equipped with a multifunctional wall, including a coffee maker, a mini fridge and a day bed, which can all be hidden away when working.”“We will be targeting customers who are reluctant to return to their normal office environment,” Xu said. “Even though the government is calling for workers to go back to the office, people aren’t going. We all want an inidual space. This will be an inidual space that incorporates the benefits of home working.”Anna Codrea-Rado, co-presenter of popular careers podcast Is This Working?, said inidual office pods like those proposed by Xu could be key to helping large numbers of people be more productive after months of struggling to work from chaotic households.“It might actually be what happens in the future,” Codrea-Rado said. “People are worried about busy offices and aren’t interested in co-working spaces because of virus safety.“At the same time it is really challenging when people are living with housemates and everyone is trying to work from home, so there really might be scope for this. But I don’t know how realistic it is that people would be able to pay that much for it.”Xu reckons it will be years before office working returns to the way it was before the pandemic. A danger Xu reckons many people are overlooking is lifts. “Office buildings are generally many levels high and we use lifts to get up them,” he said. “Lifts are very confined spaces that a lot of people share and are often more densely packed than the tube.” His offices, which are six or seven storeys, will have wide staircases.Xu’s cubes, which are being created by east London design company Egg Limited, will be connected to a hub of shared amenities including printers, scanners, kitchens, restaurants, laundry rooms and multimedia broadcasting suites. He also promises a team of lawyers and accountants on site that freelancers or small businesses can turn to for advice.Each floor of 18 cubes will also feature showers. Xu said these extra facilities will encourage workers to spend longer on site, thereby reducing the use of public transport and exposure to the virus.When asked whether workers might end up spending the night in the cube, Xu says it will be actively encouraged. “The facilities will be so good that they can support our workers if they need to work on an overnight project,” he says. “I will be taking a cube myself and spending some nights there to avoid the commute.“The working environment in most traditional offices is quite boring, and very few are human-centred,” said Xu, who has been living in north London since the virus struck the UK in March. “After eight hours people want to leave and go to the pub or a park. With our office people want to stay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e1e451b584a678b6a7d2590f429579188fba7f6/0_140_6075_3645/master/6075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=889f6871123ba879eb2597c89d67ce22","title":"scotch whisky makers rail against uk government inaction over us tariffs","story":"The Scotch whisky industry has attacked the UK government for its “inexplicably slow” action against hefty tariffs imposed on whisky imports by the US government.Karen Betts, the SWA’s chief executive, said the tariffs had already caused “huge damage” to the industry. It had led to the loss of £300m in US sales, with some firms pulling out of the US entirely, adding to the sales crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Truss’s visit to the US last week to lobby Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative leading his government’s trade deal talks, “was clearly too little, too late”, Betts said.“The UK government must accelerate negotiations to bring an end to tariffs between the UK and US before preparations for November’s presidential election bring talks to a halt,” Betts added. “It has taken the UK government a full six months after the UK left the EU to start to tackle tariffs directly with the US government, which seems to us inexplicably slow.“The UK government must now focus its energy on developing a clear strategy for settling the UK share of the AirbusBoeing and steel and aluminium disputes with the US, rather than looking to the EU to do this for us.”Airbus said last month it would end a system of financial support from France and Spain that the World Trade Organization had deemed illegal and unfair to Boeing, Airbus’s arch rival. However, Lighthizer said on Wednesday the EU and member states had “not taken the actions necessary to come into compliance with WTO decisions”.Truss confirmed on Twitter on Thursday morning she was still pressing for the continuing tariffs on malt whisky to be lifted. “I welcome the US decision not to impose tariffs on gin and blended whisky, and to remove tariffs on shortbread,” she said.SWA officials believe the US is keeping the malt whisky, as well as other high-value goods such as cashmere woollens, as a bargaining chip in its battle with the EU and UK in the Airbus-Boeing dispute, after the WTO upheld US complaints that the EU unfairly subsidises Airbus.The SWA believes UK ministers were relying too heavily on the EU to negotiate a deal in that dispute, and only began focusing on the damage to UK exports after the it began intensively lobbying ministers, including Boris Johnson, during the prime minister’s trip to Scotland last month.The controversy also plays heavily into domestic politics, fuelling attacks in Scotland on the UK government’s eagerness to strike deals with President Donald Trump while failing to protect such a valuable and emblematic product, nine months before next May’s Scottish parliamentary election.Brendan O’Hara, the SNP MP for Argyll and Bute, and chair of the all-party group on whisky in the House of Commons, said the Trump administration’s decision to maintain tariffs on malt was “a devastating body blow to Scotland’s vital whisky sector”.He added: “The industry is looking to Boris Johnson to come good on his pledge to protect the sector from these punishing tariffs - it’s beyond shameful that we are still waiting for action to follow his rhetoric.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9d5f474b51da9aff7e95b45cf6fe0b7860c1da6/0_172_5904_3544/master/5904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a0cdf6fc9c2657e4671a237870b9d39","title":"tui records 1bn loss amid covid 19 travel shutdown","story":"The firm’s cruise operations remain suspended until later in August.The firm’s chief executive, Fritz Joussen, said Tui was the first travel company to fly passengers on holiday following the lifting of restrictions and stressed that “summer holidays are conducted responsibly and with the highest standards of hygiene in all markets”.“We acted very quickly at the beginning of the crisis in March and we responsibly mastered the new start in the summer – together with governments and partners. We will now sustainably reduce our costs and thereby strengthen our position in the market,” Joussen said.Tui said it would not provide a forecast for the rest of the year, as the pandemic continues to impact travel.The UK government’s introduction of new travel restrictions and quarantine measures also led to a wave of fresh cancellations, after Tui cancelled all Britons’ holidays to mainland Spain until 9 August.The group has reduced its holiday capacity for 2021, but said bookings for that year were “very promising”, with hopes that there would be a return to normal in 2022.Tui confirmed it has secured an extra €1.2bn of funding from the German government, to get it through the quiet winter season.This is on top of a €1.8bn loan commitment it received from German state lender KfW in March as travel ground to a halt across Europe, taking its total government support to €3bn.Tui, which is also the UK’s biggest holiday operator, announced in July it would shut 166 high street travel stores across the UK and Ireland, and ask affected staff to work from home, as the coronavirus pandemic has hastened the shift to booking holidays online rather than on the high street."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68438a5f6401d97ffbb6184fd9167563a27a88ce/0_501_3905_2343/master/3905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c2902a74e30c1ac3af1543f2acd905","title":"president kamala harris in 2024 this might be joe bidens thinking","story":"Such is the scale of rebuilding the US after Trump and Covid, Biden might already be futureproofing the DemocratsJoe Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris as his Democratic vice-presidential running mate in November’s American election is by turns audacious and cautious, radical and conservative, historic and same-old. Nevertheless, although there were several other qualified candidates for the role, Harris is likely to prove a smart choice.You can see this, in a brief and minor way, by the tsunami of abuse and contempt from Donald Trump and his supporters that didn’t materialise after the announcement on Wednesday. With next week’s mainly virtual Democratic convention in Milwaukee days away, the vice-presidential pick was always going to open a window of opportunity for Trump to get into the Biden henhouse and make trouble. That hasn’t happened yet – though doubtless he will try. But it suggests Harris was not the pick Trump had been hoping for.Even on day one, the choice reminds us that Biden is very serious about winning the election. But the radical and historic aspects of Harris’s place on the ticket cannot be passed over as mere add-ons. Biden announced months ago that he would choose a female running mate. But Harris will still be only the fourth woman on a major party ticket in US history following Geraldine Ferraro, Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton. Her three female predecessors were all defeated. If she is elected, Harris would prove once and for all that women can win. The choice suggests that Biden, the lifelong Washington pragmatist, recognises the power of female voters to his party and that men are ready to help elect a woman too.But Biden has also chosen the first woman of colour on a major party presidential ticket. That’s hardly a minor milestone in US history, as recent events underscore. Nor was it a foregone conclusion. There were qualified alternatives available, including Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.But a summer dominated by the aftermath of the George Floyd killing and the Black Lives Matter movement would have been a catastrophically bad moment to pick another white candidate. Biden also came under a lot of pressure at the business end of the process to choose a black woman. It was a timely reminder of something he knows better than anyone – namely, how much his own nomination owes to black voters, who brought his campaign back from the dead in February’s South Carolina primary. Once again, the pragmatist has revealed an openness to new ways that some might have thought beyond him.This openness has also extended to the policy process that has been undertaken in the wake of the fight for the nomination. Since May, Biden’s team has been working in six policy task forces on the economy, healthcare, immigration, criminal justice, climate and education. Each is co-chaired by a Biden supporter and a former Bernie Sanders backer. The climate group, for example, is co-chaired by John Kerry and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The process seems to speak to two things: the influence of significant parts of the pro-Sanders left within the party, and Biden’s readiness to engage with it in ways that Hillary Clinton, for example, did not in 2016.Nevertheless, the Harris pick also shows some of the limits of Biden’s embrace of new movements. Harris has often been charged with being too pro-police in police shooting cases as district attorney in San Francisco then attorney general in California, though supporters say she has shifted her view in recent years. Critics also charge her with being light on policy. Yet that was not true when she was San Francisco district attorney and began a programme of alternatives to custody for drug offenders. If she were to spearhead something similar from the vice-presidential office two decades later, it could help to transform America’s catastrophic and destructive incarceration obsession.It is easy to exaggerate the importance of a vice-presidential pick. It’s the presidential candidate who wins or loses the contest. Biden certainly didn’t need to put Harris on the ticket in order to carry California. But the vice-presidency itself is too easily dismissed. Franklin Roosevelt’s first vice-president’s memorable comparison of the job is still often quoted. Yet, in spite of Mike Pence’s performance since 2017, some recent vice-presidents have been significant, both politically and as executives. George HW Bush, Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Biden himself have been substantial vice-presidential players in ways that Dan Quayle, for example, was not.Harris is in the substantial category for the overwhelming reason that it is possible to imagine her as president. That’s partly because, post-Trump and post-Covid, there would be substantial work for all hands in the new administration. But the main reason is Biden’s age. He will be 78 in November. It has been hinted, though not definitely stated, that he might serve only a single term. He has referred to himself as a transitional figure in the party, paving the way for a new generation. Either way, Harris has now become overnight the presumptive next Democratic presidential nominee after Biden. That gives her a lot of power. For the next generation of Democrats, it is suddenly important to get close to her, and to take what she says seriously.Trump and Covid mean that American government in the 2020s will not be steered by the compass of the past. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that only one part of the Democratic party understands this. Biden’s choice of Harris, like his approach to the Sanders wing over policy, is part of an effort to unify a very ided party to defeat Trump and measure up to the issues facing America and the world.There are more grounds for thinking this unity may happen than either some Bernie-or-bust revolutionaries or identity politics movements care to admit. An Obama-type centrist like Harris isn’t the worst thing in the world to be when running against Trump. Now, though, there is the mother of all election battles to win, whose outcome remains deeply uncertain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c214044ac3910a8d6dabf5c0c234fce7c828bd/0_83_4928_2958/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f57e012391fe1700b3f269e125f709e2","title":"ive seen an oligarchs superyacht and now im channeling bernie sanders","story":"Spying a $100m boat in a Croatian harbour has brought up some complicated feelings about the super-rich Nearby was an odd-shaped ship called Sputnik.

But there’s one type of discrimination which still needs a larger reckoning: colourism – discrimination based on skin tone.In Black is King, Beyoncé tried to open our eyes. The clip for Brown Skin Girl was a kind of skin democracy featuring black women of all tones, from models Adut Akech and Naomi Campbell to actor Lupita Nyong’o, as did the lyrics (“Pose like a trophy when Naomis walk in  She need an Oscar for that pretty dark skin  Pretty like Lupita when the cameras close in”). In a much-shared gif from the video, as the light-skinned Beyoncé mouths the words “’cos you’re beautiful” to the darker-skinned Kelly Rowland, it cut through all the years of chatter about perceived rivalry. The supposed rivalry wasn’t just about pitting one former member of Destiny’s Child against another it also exposed an ongoing “light skin versus dark skin” narrative (see Kanye West’s line: “with some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands”). Brown Skin Girl presents a utopian ideal, because skin tone privilege really does exist, and it’s pervasive and insidious.“The media helps to perpetuate colourism by prioritising light skin over darker skin shades, particularly in relation to women,” Dr Aisha Phoenix, a postdoctoral researcher at Soas University of London, recently told CNN. “If light-skinned women are always the ones presented as being more beautiful, that helps to instill in communities the idea that light skin is more beautiful than darker skin shades.”A preference for lighter skin tones, even among people of colour, is one of the obvious legacies of eurocentric beauty standards. Yet colourism continues to hide in plain sight. Is it so insidious we can’t call it out or talk about it?In Netflix’s addictive and controversial new reality show Indian Matchmaking, where matchmaker Sima Taparia works to marry up her clients from across the world, colourism is troublingly normalised. One of the key attributes a potential partner should have is a “fair” complexion, an attribute which is also tied to the caste system. It’s something which is mentioned so casually that one could miss the connection between having “fair skin” and being beautiful, powerful and, perhaps worst of all, valued.The perception that dark skin is “bad” and lighter skin is “good” continues to haunt the culture: earlier this month the Italian fashion brand Marni pulled a campaign which featured dark-skinned models posing alongside colonial and slavery-centric imagery and words, with one model wearing chains on his ankles.Earlier this week, the American actor Zoe Saldana, who is of Dominican and Puerto Rican descent, apologised for playing Nina Simone in the 2016 film. It was an apology with a space in it where a conversation about colourism should have happened. “I should have never played Nina,” she said. “I’m so sorry. I know better today, and I’m never going to do that again.” Not explicitly mentioned was the fact that Saldana’s lighter skin was seen as more bankable in Hollywood for the role, she wore darker-toned makeup, an afro wig and a prosthetic nose – a sort of cinematic blackface that’s unsettling when you seen it on screen.Last month the actor Viola Davis was featured on the cover of Vanity Fair she was photographed by Dario Calmese, staggeringly, the first black photographer to shoot a cover for the magazine in its 107-year history. Yet the triumph had a sting in its tail. The photograph of Davis was inspired by The Scourged Back, an iconic and extremely disturbing photograph of a black man named Gordon, sometimes known as “Whipped Peter”. Gordon was a previously enslaved man who ran 80 miles to join the Union army in 1863. His back was brutally scarred from whippings, and northern abolitionists printed and distributed the photo to disprove white southerners’ claim that slavery was a benign institution.In an interview with the New York Times, Calmese explained: “I knew that this was a moment to say something … I knew this was a moment to be, like, extra black.” But some critics have questioned what “extra black” means, and if this reimagining of the slavery narrative would have worked with an actor who had different-coloured skin. “This photographer NEVER would have reimagined ‘The Scoured Black’ with Halle, Thandie or Zendaya,” tweeted writer Kellee Nicole Terrell. “This fascination black men … have with linking dark skin women to slavery and trauma is jarring.”There are disturbing parallels here with the narratives of slavery. “Preferential treatment was given to slaves with light skin,” Phoenix told CNN, “who were the mixed-race children of slave owners and slaves. They were allowed to work in the house and were seen to have higher status than those with darker skin and those who had traits that were more similar to African features. The contrast between the way they were treated helped to ingrain the idea that light skin was better.” It’s sad that hundreds of years later, we are stuck in these narratives.In Brown Skin Girl, Beyoncé sings of self-love and pride at one’s skin tone: “There’s complexities in complexion  but your skin, it glow like diamonds.” It can be read as a protest song of sorts, whose message needs to heard now more than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ea736c34c432bf4723c6fe77444c43002ef6f41/0_81_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d33f8f0e348bd5fff177c3ccaeaa1e03","title":"almost 40 of english students have a level results downgraded","story":"The combined results issued by the exam boards for England found that a record proportion of school-leavers will have received the top A* grade this year, while there was also a big increase in the proportion awarded As by algorithm.But the increase in higher grades was not enough to stem mounting dismay among headteachers, with a survey of sixth form college heads in England reporting that several said this year’s results were the worst in their college’s history.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “While there has been an overall increase in top grades, we are very concerned that this disguises a great deal of volatility among the results at school and student level.“We have received heartbreaking feedback from school leaders about grades being pulled down in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable. They are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on their students.”Ofqual described the 2020 exam series as “exceptional” because of the school closures and exam cancellations that followed the coronavirus outbreak in March, forcing it to develop a statistical model to calculate and moderate teacher assessments submitted by schools, in place of formal exams.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, revealed that he has asked exam boards to encourage schools to appeal against their results if they feared disadvantaged candidates were being affected by this year’s system.“There is sometimes a danger where you have an exceptionally high-performing child in a low-performing school to be in a situation where they don’t get the grades that they want to,” Williamson said in an interview with LBC.“What we’ve asked the exam boards is, where they think there may be outliers, is actually to be contacting the schools to talk with them to make sure that appeals are put forward.”Ofqual’s own figures showed that pupils at independent schools received double the improvement in A* and A grades compared with those attending state comprehensives, while sixth form colleges received only a tiny improvement.A survey of principals conducted by the Sixth Form Colleges Association found “huge variations” between the exam grades predicted by teachers – known as centre-assessed grades – and the final grades students received from Ofqual.“Despite following the guidelines for developing centre assessed grades, colleges reported that the government’s standardisation process had resulted in huge numbers of students receiving lower grades than expected, with some reporting that two thirds of their results had been downgraded,” the association said.Some college heads reported that their results “were the worst since records began”. That was despite earlier assurances by Ofqual that its standardisation process would “ensure national results are broadly similar to previous years”.The head of one sixth form college in Barnet, north London, said he was disappointed that half of the college’s submitted grades had been revised down, despite the college internally moderating its assessments to fit its results of recent years.Bill Watkin, the chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said: “Our survey suggests that the government’s model for calculating this year’s A-level grades is flawed and unreliable. A fundamental objective of the process was to ensure year-on-year comparability in exam results – the very clear evidence from our members is that the standardisation model has utterly failed to achieve this.”Ofqual defended its approach, saying: “Without standardisation there was the potential for students to be unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged, depending on the school or college they attended and the approach they took.”The regulator also said it had looked at “potential advantage or disadvantage across different demographic and socioeconomic groups” of its methods. “The analyses show no evidence that this year’s process of awarding grades has introduced bias,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc9863eaae02e87253f5d8c79c846a350f9cb31a/0_24_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=772b790a9e0db98110246288ed41d85a","title":"share your reaction and experiences on a level results day 2020","story":"Whatever your story, and wherever you’re headed next, tell us how you feel about this year’s resultsEmotions will be running high on Thursday as students across the country get their A-level results amid a row over how grades have been calculated due to the Covid pandemic.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, last night sought to placate pupils and their families by saying he was “incredibly sorry” for the disruption to their education during the coronavirus outbreak.

Chambers, who hopes to study maths at the University of Birmingham, considered staying in halls, but decided against it. “I chose to stay at home because it’s easier financially, and is probably a more stable option during the pandemic,” he says. “Who knows what will happen?”Chambers isn’t alone in making a difficult decision about where to live. Students must always decide between different types of living arrangements, and this year the Covid-19 pandemic is another factor to consider.In reality, the options around accommodation remain pretty much the same, says Ian Munton, director of library and student services at the University of Staffordshire. Students must choose between student halls, private accommodation such as shared houses, or commuting.First-year students normally stay in halls of residence. This year, the experience will be different, with some unis planning to create “social bubbles” where students may have to live with coursemates.Ian Jones, deputy director of accommodation at the University of Sheffield, says nothing should feel too strange for students: measures in public spaces will be similar to elsewhere, such as floor markings to ensure distance and the provision of hand sanitisers. “But we’re looking at ways to do as many in-person social activities as we can,” he says, for instance by making use of outdoor space.Jones advises students to talk to someone at the university if they’re worried. “One thing we can do is sit down in person or online with everyone in the flat and come to a flatmate agreement on how things like cleaning will be managed.”Students who are in high-risk groups don’t have to rule out student accommodation either, he says. “Ring up and speak to the accommodation office to see what’s in place,” he advises. Universities may be able to provide special accommodation with fewer people, so have those conversations, he says.With so much still up in the air, is it wise to sign up for accommodation now, or should students leave it until the last minute? Many unis say they will release you from contracts if coronavirus guidance changes pre-September. However, this may not be the case everywhere, or for private accommodation.Daniel Fitzpatrick, a housing partner at law firm Hodge Jones \u0026amp Allen, says it’s all down to the contract. So look for a clause that says if you can’t attend, you can waive the rent. “Just be wary,” he says. “A lot of students don’t know that many halls of residence are now owned privately. Ask the university what guarantees they can give you.”Dan Roberts, founder of Mystudenthalls, says some private providers have introduced special Covid-19 cancellation policies, so look for this in the contract. However, providers without such a policy may not be willing to negotiate an early release from tenancies if there is a second wave of coronavirus.All this may make commuting seem like an appealing option. If you opt to stay at home you’ll need to look at transport, as well as at the support your uni offers. You should be able to access the library and other essential student facilities.Whatever option you go for, remember it will be different this year. “It’s not going to be the same experience,” Jones says, “but I think it’ll be a really good one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6eab52b12c97551ee5c2b01daa48adfde035a84/0_4_3920_2352/master/3920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f79f434718bbbb9fa7dc9cc22fac331","title":"large blue butterfly flutters in cotswolds for first time in 150 years","story":"Painstaking conservation effort to accommodate insect’s complex lifecycle pays offThe biggest reintroduction to date of the large blue has led to the rare butterfly flying on a Cotswold hillside where it has not been seen for 150 years.About 750 butterflies emerged on to Rodborough Common in Gloucestershire this summer after 1,100 larvae were released last autumn following five years of innovative grassland management to create optimum habitat.The globally endangered butterfly now flies in greater number in Britain than anywhere else in the world, four decades after it became extinct in the country.Its return to Britain is arguably the most successful insect reintroduction project worldwide, after caterpillars were initially brought from Sweden in an ecologist’s camper van.Years of painstaking work by Prof Jeremy Thomas and David Simcox led to the butterfly being successfully reintroduced to sites in Somerset and more recently Gloucestershire.To do so, they first had to understand its unique lifecycle, with tiny caterpillars dropping off wild thyme and being taken underground by the red ant, Myrmica sabuleti, which is duped into believing that the parasitic larva is one of their own.The ants carry it into their nests to protect the caterpillar, even “singing” to it, before it turns from herbivore into carnivore and feasts on ant grubs through the winter until it is ready to pupate. The butterfly emerges from underground the following summer.The common, which is owned by the National Trust, first required temporary grazing areas for cattle on steep slopes – where they wouldn’t usually choose to go – alongside the removal of scrub, to create ideal conditions for the red ant.Simcox, a research ecologist and the co-author of the commons management plan, said: “The butterfly needs high densities of the heat-loving red ant … which has a crucial role to play in the lifecycle of the butterfly.“The grazing cows create the ideal conditions for them by keeping the grass down so sunlight can reach the soil which gently warms it, creating perfect conditions for the ants, which are cold-blooded and therefore need warmth in order to actively scout for food throughout the spring, summer and autumn.”The reintroduction was a partnership involving the National Trust, Butterfly Conservation, the Back from the Brink project and others. As the climate warms, the large blue should be able to spread northwards, but only if helped to find new habitat.Richard Evans, a ranger for Rodborough and Minchinhampton commons, said: “Butterflies are such sensitive creatures, and with the large blue’s particular requirements they are real barometers for what is happening with our environment and the changing climate.“Creating the right conditions for this globally endangered butterfly to not only survive but to hopefully thrive has been the culmination of many years work. None of this would have been possible without the combined efforts of conservationists and the local graziers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f284df04a3778966477fb70d1ff06369566515a/0_35_3964_2380/master/3964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9132131fb745b84b82e78a84689c45f9","title":"dallas ","story":"There was a smattering of boos when players from FC Dallas and Nashville SC collectively took a knee during the national anthem before their MLS game on Wednesday night in Frisco, Texas.Dallas defender Reggie Cannon said he was disgusted by the boos at Toyota Stadium when players and officials knelt to call attention to racial injustice. He said teammate Ryan Hollingshead turned to him afterward and said he was sorry.“You can’t even have support from your own fans in your own stadium. It’s baffling to me, Cannon said. “As a team we try to give the best possible product on the field and these last six months have been absolute hell for us.

Some of the games will include fans if local jurisdictions allow it.Just over 5,000 were allowed to attend the match at Toyota Stadium, although the crowd that showed up appeared even smaller than the official reported turnout of 2,912. All fans were required to sign a liability waiver in which they agreed not to pursue legal action against MLS, the teams, or Soccer United Marketing (SUM) – the league’s marketing arm – if they contract the disease as a result of their attendance.Nashville won the game, 1-0, on David Accam’s 86th-minute winner to secure the expansion club’s first ever victory. The two teams meet again on Sunday.The death of George Floyd has spurred a number of MLS players to form the group Black Players for Change, which seeks to address systemic racism in soccer and society.At the opening game of the MLS tournament in Florida, members of the group collectively stood in silence, fists raised, for more than eight minutes.

Cannon said the players had asked that it not be played before the game because they didn’t feel it was right for the anthem to be played in this moment.“We had someone chanting U-S-A, but they don’t understand what kneeling means. They don’t understand why we’re kneeling. They can’t see the reason. They think we’re the ignorant ones,” Cannon said. “It’s incredibly frustrating. I’m sorry to have this tone, but you have to call it for what it is.”Cannon said he expected to have some negative pushback over the unified response.“It hurts me because I love our fans, I love this club, and I want to see the support that the league has given us, that everyone has given us, from our fans,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7faa3fc75b016a52bc60b7c425aa0eb412b44789/11_0_3418_2051/master/3418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcf15c60605cd0065886f531bed44464","title":"jadon sancho happy to help youngsters develop at borussia dortmund","story":"Jadon Sancho has cast further doubt on a move to Manchester United by expressing his enjoyment at helping some of his fellow young players develop at Borussia Dortmund.Sancho has been heavily linked with a move to United having agreed personal terms on a basic salary of around £250,000 a week.

Nevertheless, he’s here.Speaking through a translator, Ahmed explains how, with the loss of this year’s tourist season due to the pandemic, his seasonal job in the nearby island resorts of Djerba has failed to materialise. Now he’s saving what money he can from casual work at a local gym for the 4,000 Tunisian dinars, (£1,125) he’ll need to make the illegal crossing from Tunisia into Europe.“In Tunisia you can work, but you don’t make money. What you earn, you consume. Before coronavirus there were no jobs,” he says, referring to the country’s endemic unemployment. “Now with coronavirus it’s not going to get better.”Departing from points along Tunisia’s coast, Tunisians are now the largest group of nationals arriving in Italy, according to figures from the interior ministry, testing its reception centres to the limit. In the first six months of 2019, 1,277 arrivals from Tunisia were intercepted by Italian authorities. This year, that number rose to 6,628.In July alone, as the pandemic took hold and the waters calmed, 4,252 migrants were intercepted by Italian authorities, compared with 502 the previous year. These numbers do not include those who landed in Italy undetected.Compared with many countries so far Tunisia’s brush with Covid-19 has been light. At the time of writing, only 1,678 cases of the virus had been detected, resulting in 51 deaths, though the threat of a potential second spike looms ominously.However, for an economy still struggling to recover from the conditions that led to its 2011 revolution, the combined effect of the lockdown, the loss of its tourism season and the global economic downturn is proving devastating.By the government’s own estimate, joblessness in the tourism sector alone could reach 400,000.Moreover, Tunisia’s small traders working on the margins of society risk being pushed to breaking point.Meddeb said a recent law prohibiting the dismissal of workers for economic reasons during the pandemic was well-intentioned but has only served to postpone the coming storm, as wage bills remain fixed and the drastic drop in demand pushes Tunisian companies to the brink.In the meantime, illegal migration flourishes. Unlike the industrial human trade in nearby Libya – and, according to locals, from points north along the Tunisian coast where migrants make the trip on larger craft – migration from Zarzis remains very much an artisan affair. Fishermen in Zarzis, one of the country’s largest fishing ports, occasionally make their boats available to pilots, who will then steer the tiny craft to Italy, undisturbed by international radars. Given the huge scale of the sprawling port, passage is not hard to find.“Whereas in Libya the trafficking of migrants is managed by solid and structured criminal organisations, in Tunisia the smuggling racket is often run by groups of fishermen,” says Salvatore Vella, a prosecutor in Agrigento who is leading the investigations on alleged human trafficking from Tunisia to Sicily.“They take 70 to 80 people on board, and when they arrive within a few miles of the island, they put the passengers in small boats to complete the journey on their own. Then they return to the Tunisian coasts and carry on with their fishing activities. It sounds like smuggling has become an additional source of income for some Tunisian fishermen, as their earnings have also decreased because of the Covid emergency.”While images of Tunisians arriving in Italy apparently dressed for their holidays pulling suitcases on wheels and carrying poodles have provided ample fodder for the country’s right-wing commentators, there is little doubt of the poverty that grips many in Zarzis.Increasingly, entire families are among those departing, with more mothers and children now making the perilous 206-mile journey to connect with relatives already in Europe. Perhaps understandably, none of those approached by the  was willing to be quoted.However, Vella has no qualms about speaking up: “We are no longer witnessing exclusive arrivals of young people in search of a better future,” he says. “In the last few months, entire families have begun arriving at our shores, and from an array of social classes, even members of what we may describe as Tunisia’s middle class.“The impression is that the economic crisis caused by the pandemic has hit not only the poorest sectors of society, but also small- and medium-sized Tunisian businesspeople. They’re arriving with their pets and large suitcases, but not for a holiday. They’ve left their homes forever.”The preferred entry point for Tunisians is the island of Lampedusa, in Sicily, approximately 10 hours by boat from the coast of Zarzis. The arrival of thousands of Tunisians in recent weeks has led to overcrowding at the island’s welcome centre, which now holds more than 1,000 people. The majority of Tunisians who arrive at Lampedusa are transferred to Sicily, registered and then sent back to Tunisia on direct flights from Palermo to Tunis. Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte has threatened to increase such repatriation flights in response to the high number of arrivals. Consequently, the only choice for many migrants is to flee from Sicilian welcome centres to avoid repatriation.Under pressure to act, the Tunisian government has launched measures aimed at stemming the flow of migrants from its shores. From 6 August, the country announced the deployment of naval units, surveillance devices, and search teams to patrol the waters around the country’s known departure points.“The situation has become unmanageable,” says Lampedusa’s mayor, Totò Martello. “If the government fails to proclaim a state of emergency for Lampedusa, then I will.”For an island that was once heralded for its welcoming of migrants, the wave of recent arrivals from Tunisia has worn thin the resolve of some islanders, who accuse the authorities of putting the management of the asylum seekers on citizens’ shoulders.In June Vella launched an investigation into an arson attack that destroyed the “migrant boats graveyard” of Lampedusa. Hundreds of dilapidated boats used over the years by migrants setting forth from North Africa were set ablaze, causing panic among islanders in what investigators believed was a political attack against the authorities – the latest in a series of attacks against pro-migrant symbols. Three days earlier, the monumental work “Gateway to Europe” was vandalised, designed by artist Mimmo Paladino in 2008 and a memorial to the migrants who perished while attempting the journey from North Africa to Europe.“There’s a parallel between the effect of the pandemic on the economy of Tunisia and the economic consequences in Sicily,” says Martello. “Even those who should welcome migrants, like us islanders, are in a bind because of the effects of the Covid crisis.”Elsewhere in Zarzis, within the city’s sweltering backstreets, Ridha showed the  round his home, pointing to the bed where he slept in the open, and the outhouse where his brother slept. Their mother lives in the house’s two threadbare rooms.With medical bills to pay for the family, Ridha has been offered free passage on condition he serves as mate to the boat’s skipper. The trip would provide him with the opportunity to send regular money home. He is aware of the penalties for trafficking, up to 10 years’ imprisonment according to a 2016 law, but in reality closer to six months, and is reluctant to make the trip. Instead, he will save what he can from sporadic house painting work and selling fish. But the temptation to leave Tunisia is strong. As a passenger, the worse the law can do is return him home, TD4,000 worse off.“In Europe, you can earn €50 (£45) to €60 a day. I can take €20 a day and send the rest back,” Ridha says. “Then I can bring my family over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7688119cd221130fe20d8ed0041218bf34864bb5/0_314_5848_3510/master/5848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0b3b1472e35e350d3f103d8c377702c","title":"peace where rights arent trampled afghan womens demands ahead of taliban talks","story":"With negotiations set to begin, women have been sharing their ‘red lines’ on the progress they refuse to see negotiatedFarahnaz Forotan was three when the Taliban had arrived in Kabul. It was 1996. “I have this memory of a snowy day, I was sitting on my mother’s lap, in a minibus, and she was crying. I didn’t understand why she was crying,” Forotan says. It was the day her family became refugees.“It was the civil war, and we had to leave our home and country to live in Iran – alive, but living in pain and facing discrimination,” she says.Now Forotan, whose family returned to Afghanistan in 2001, is making sure the militants who disrupted her childhood don’t use the upcoming peace talks to roll back gains women have made.“Today, the US and the world are surrendering us to the group that still kills us every day … in our streets, in our schools and even in our homes. We have been numbed into silence, by war, violence and pain, for far too long. But now we want to shout,” says Forotan.Talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government could start in Qatar this week, after the grand assembly, under pressure from the US, agreed on Sunday to release 400 militant prisoners, a Taliban condition for joining the negotiations.Many women fear that freedoms gained in the 20 years since the fall of the Taliban will be sacrificed in the talks. Just five women are included in the 21-member negotiating team.Looking away from Forotan’s camera to protect her identity, a middle-aged woman from Helmand, one of the provinces worst hit by conflict, speaks in one of the videos:“I want peace that lasts. A five-day peace is not good for me or anyone. I was whipped in public once while taking my sick child to the doctor. When I asked the man why he hit me, he told me not to leave the house without a man. My husband is disabled, I am the breadwinner of the family. How can I not leave the house? We want permanent peace in which women’s rights are not trampled.”Nagina Anwari, a software engineer, is helping with the campaign. She says the peace process scares her. “I am scared because we are represented by only a few symbolic figures negotiating a possible return of the Taliban on my behalf.”Anwari, who is from Kandahar, once the capital of the regime, says memories of the Taliban’s atrocities are still fresh.“The girl in Kabul is struggling to make ends meet and seeking equal rights, while the girl in the village stays awake all night because she can no longer go to school and must get married forcefully. Their circumstances are different so their demands are different,” she says.“Another woman who had been married three times in the same house first to her husband’s brother after he was killed, then again to the younger brother after the second one was killed. What is left of her but an empty and desolate body that was scarified to war and ignorance?” she says.But Forotan also gathered stories of strength. “I witnessed women who have gone through all these hardships and are still working tirelessly so their children can study. I was left speechless meeting girls who so boldly challenged the stereotypes of society in their male-dominated cities,” she says.Afghan women, she says, are not just worried about their own rights. “Women are worried about the order and structure that we’ve achieved so far in the last 20 years. Even if it has its shortcomings, it is worth saving. These are not feminine or masculine demands they are the general concerns among the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/546fc1ad6fba8cc6b29ec14388f88cb61b034a64/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ab6be6f79ac8f8d47a69bad23efed18","title":"angela saini understanding history reminds us race is a social construct","story":"Teach scientists their history and they won’t repeat bizarre racial myths• Time to reset: more brilliant ideas to remake the worldAlvin Weinberg was director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, established during the second world war to provide nuclear material for the Manhattan Project to develop the first atomic bomb. In his 1967 book Reflections On Big Science he warned of the growing danger of specialisation in science, sending researchers into ever narrower fields of study at the expense of the broader perspective. “Only the specialist knows what he is talking about,” Weinberg wrote. “Only the generalist knows why he should talk at all.”This was a problem that came to bite early on in the pandemic, when top-flight medical researchers began speculating as to whether gross racial disparities in death rates might be down to genetics, even though we know from decades of research that this is near impossible given the lack of genetic differences between what are socially defined racial groups. Even a shallow understanding of history would have reminded them that race is a social construct.Scientific ideas sit in political and cultural contexts. For instance, modern intelligence research emerged directly out of the early British eugenics movement. IQ tests, and the false notion that everyone is born with an inherited and immutable level of intelligence, emerged from efforts to decide which children were worth investing in and which were not. They targeted the poor in particular.I’m surprised at how few scientists, engineers and doctors I meet know the history of their own fields, let alone science more broadly. In the 19th century, beliefs in the biological exceptionalism of non-white people prompted serious investigations into the possibility that black people felt pain less than white people that their skins were thicker and bones denser. A 2016 survey of medical students and trainees at the University of Virginia found that half still believed at least one of these bizarre racial myths.This is not just about ignorance of history. Snobbery towards the social sciences also prevents scientists from fully accepting the ways in which knowledge has been constructed and how politics is embedded in the process. Without this long view, it’s too easy to repeat the mistakes of the past or persist in outmoded ways of thinking, not least around race and gender. We look to science to enlighten, but what if scientists are the ones in need of enlightenment?One answer would be to fully integrate the humanities into undergraduate science courses, creating generalists. For every scientific concept they learn, students should also be questioning where that concept came from, who developed it, and – most importantly – why.• Angela Saini is the author of Superior: The Return Of Race Science (4th Estate)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5adaf72278a3fadd2509cf6a1d2a036fea47a26/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2535d602e5e74eb07330fc4e01aceb28","title":"david lammy ex offenders should have the chance of a clean slate","story":"Those who have made mistakes but have since turned their lives around should be given the chance to contribute• Time to reset: more brilliant ideas to remake the world“Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We only have today. Let us begin.” As expressed by Mother Teresa, the idea that you cannot let your past define your future is a source of motivation for many. The problem is that not everybody has a choice.As part of my 2017 review into the criminal justice system, I recommended the introduction of a process by which former offenders could have their criminal records sealed. More specifically, former offenders should have their case heard by either a judge or a body like the Parole Board, which can decide whether to seal their record from employers. In doing so, we’d be learning from a system that already works in several US states.Ironically, the loudest argument against this process is related to the fear of reoffence. Ex-offenders, the argument goes, pose a threat to society, and so employers should have a right to make their own risk assessments. It’s worth emphasising, firstly, that those who cannot demonstrate they have changed would not have their records sealed. Neither would those whose crimes are so serious – be they violent or sex-related – that the judgment body deems their record relevant to employers. Secondly, sealing criminal records from employers does not mean they are sealed in all contexts. Records would still show in situations involving children and vulnerable people, as well as specific work contexts that require high levels of security clearance. Crucially, police and courts would still have access to an ex-offender’s record. The aim is to replace a blunt instrument with a more flexible approach in order to reflect the complexity of criminal justice.The argument against reform relies on the false assumption that ex-offenders are inherently criminal. The reality is that the likelihood of reoffending spikes when iniduals who have already been punished for past crimes are prevented from reintegrating into society through work. Those who have made mistakes but have since turned their lives around should be given the chance to contribute. As a society, we cannot afford to condemn them to the shadows.• David Lammy is an author and the shadow justice minister"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1362c98327ec76a390723e8eda4f98594ad1d920/0_45_3780_2268/master/3780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67c807f60a850179e099246fea8f7081","title":"skateboard trick to be renamed in honour of deaf inventor mute weddle grab","story":"The ‘mute grab’ to become the ‘Weddle grab’ after first person to do the move in 1981For almost 40 years, the “mute grab” has been part of a skateboarder’s bag of tricks: grabbing the toe side of the board between their feet, while rotating “backside”, to land facing the opposite direction.Now, the trick is being renamed to better honour its inventor, Chris Weddle, a deaf skater who was never actually mute in the first place.The push to rechristen the trick the “Weddle grab” comes from pro skater Tony Hawk. A remake of Hawk’s eponymous videogames, release in early September, will be the first place where the new name is used, amid hopes it will catch on among the wider community.Hawk outlined his thinking in a post on instagram: “Around 1981, a deaf skater and Colton skatepark local named Chris Weddle was a prominent amateur on the competition circuit.” Weddle, he wrote, had been the first to do the new trick, and so some proposed that “it should be named after him. They referred to him as the ‘quiet, mute guy’. So it became known as the mute air, and we all went along with it in our naive youth.“He has been very gracious in his response but it is obvious that a different name would have honored his legacy, as he is hearing impaired but not lacking speech. I asked him last year as I was ing into trick origins and he said he would have rather named it the ‘deaf’ or ‘Weddle’ grab if given the choice. His exact quote to me was ‘I am deaf, not mute.’”Weddle, now 54, said he was “stoked” about the change, according to Hawk. “It’s going to be challenging to break the habit of saying the old name but I think Chris deserves the recognition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ad91636f552fc6ee68dd68964bf2713c4fedc83/139_23_3187_1912/master/3187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=036ae1ff767a671ea9755e5613ded021","title":"uk passengers barred from flights to greece over confusing covid forms","story":"Holidaymakers hit by problems with contact-tracing rules and varying airline interpretationsDozens of holidaymakers have been barred from boarding flights from the UK to Greece because of confusing red tape caused by the coronavirus.In July the Greek government announced that all passengers must submit a personal locator form including their travel and contact details 48 hours before departure. They are then emailed a QR code, which must be downloaded and presented at check-in.The details are used for contact tracing in the event of a Covid-19 outbreak and arrivals who fail to comply face a €500 fine.However, delays in receiving the code and differing interpretations of the rules by airlines have led to passengers being turned away at the airport.Some travellers claim that their airline did not inform them of the new requirements or that minor form-filling errors cost them their holiday.Karoki Lewis and his family were forbidden to board their easyJet flight to Kefalonia because he had not included the names of his two young children on the form.“It appears to be impossible to add more than two passengers on the form many other families have been affected because they only managed to enter the parents’ details,” he said.“I pointed out that small children would obviously be with their parents throughout their holiday and therefore would be easily contactable for any Covid-19 tracing but I was told that even if we were allowed on the flight, the Greek authorities would send us straight home.”The family spent £1,000 on new flights and accommodation a week later. EasyJet said it provides clear guidance to passengers by email, text and Flight Tracker when they book a flightConflicting advice on official websites has caused many passengers to fall foul of the rules.The Greek government website initially stated that all passengers over 18 had to fill out separate forms this month the advice was changed to allow households to fill out a single form and the deadline was changed to 24 hours before departure.However, a confusing layout has left some passengers unclear how to add more than two names to the online form and some airlines are still insisting that each adult must submit separate forms. Carriers face steep fines if they transport passengers with inadequate documents.Last week Wizz Air offloaded 28 passengers from a flight to Athens, citing inadequately completed forms. Several were denied boarding because they had not included their middle names, even though this is marked optional on the form. The airline has since admitted an error.“As a matter of priority, we are investigating whether any passengers were wrongfully denied carriage on the flight as a result of not including a middle name on their PLF, despite correctly completing the rest of the form,” a spokesperson said.“Should there be any affected passengers, Wizz Air will contact them directly to apologise and offer the relevant compensation, as well as the options of rebooking or refunding their ticket.”The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website confirms that only one form and QR code is required for each household but warns that some airlines insist on separate submissions and advises passengers to check with their airline what documents they need to show. In a nod to the form’s confusing layout, it also details how to add more than two family members.A spokesperson for the Greek embassy denied that delays in sending QR codes have grounded passengers and stated that it is the airlines’ responsibility to ensure that passengers have the correct paperwork.Other European countries, including the UK, require travellers from certain regions to complete health declarations or locator forms for contact tracing and passengers are being urged to check the FCO website when booking flights to ensure they comply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b26659c7ff8c2b736fe0f1ba3a56f8492d1023/0_163_5100_3062/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc771dff78c7839604e60cd8bf741bff","title":"was this just an easyjet ploy to get out of paying a refund","story":"It suggested that I cancel my upcoming flight in the light of travel restrictions and accept vouchersHow many of you were, like me, contacted by easyJet in mid June, stating that, “as government travel restrictions and safety guidelines evolve, you may wish to cancel your upcoming flights”?

I, like many others, felt obliged to accept.On 1 July, 48 hours after the deadline, easyJet informed me that it had to cancel my flights and I could apply for a full refund. I did so and, three weeks later, I received an email informing me that I was not entitled to a refund as I had been sent the vouchers I had applied for.The “voucher” turned out to be a baffling email sent on the same day confirming a “refund to credit”. Could it be that easyJet was encouraging passengers to themselves cancel flights that it knew would not be departing so that it would not be liable to refund them?EasyJet insists not. “When the offer was sent we did not know whether or not the flights would operate,” it says. “We appreciate the frustration, given the timing of the cancellations, and so we have been contacting passengers we know who are in this position to offer a refund as a gesture of goodwill. Our call centre staff have also been briefed to offer a refund should passengers make contact.”I was certainly not contacted and my attempts to apply for a refund online were in vain.

It was paused at the height of the pandemic and gradually restarted with the expectation that it will conclude later this year.Apparently concerned at how No 10 would respond to criticism, Ellwood said he hoped that the defence committee would “not be viewed an adversary of government, but instead as a constructive critic and contributor”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d74b0ce51f950202b31337389cf10760f6c8688/0_265_3979_2388/master/3979.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ac1b65dd220d3ba67c88b063f7d0ddad","title":"caring for my dad felt like something that had happened to me not a choice i made","story":"Like many other women, I started having to help my dad a little, then a lot, and before I knew it someone was calling me a carerOne night in early 2016, I found myself calling for an ambulance. My father had locked himself in the toilet for four hours and wasn’t responding to anyone. My brother and I listened at the door. Nothing. The person at the other end of the 999 call had a volley of questions: “Why did he choose the toilet? Does he have a weapon? Do you think he is suicidal?” I replied with don’t know, no and no. They wanted his rejection of life to be defined as an absolute, but it was far more shadowy and ambiguous.Panicked, I called a mental health crisis helpline too, who advised me to connect with my father through the toilet door. “Speak louder, put some force into the words,” he told me, as though I was auditioning for a part. My dad did not reply. It had been hours since I had last heard his voice, fragile, fading to a whisper. My younger brother was trying his best to help. After rummaging through a toolbox, he found a screwdriver to force between door and lock. White flakes of paint flew the door swung open and there was my father. He was wearing his pyjamas, standing upright, his body locked into a strange, repetitive loop. His left arm would rise, jerk above his head, then his right foot would lift, and the mechanical process would begin all over again. His face was scarlet, screwed into a fist of agony.When the ambulance crew arrived, we had difficulty communicating his illness. Catatonia, we explained, uncertainty in our voices. Even his doctors seemed puzzled by the state he had become prone to slipping into: a sort of waking coma, where he was conscious but his body became disconnected. In the days that followed, he was sectioned in a psychiatric ward. He could not walk, eat, speak or see, only hear. The nurses were feeding him but I worried about him becoming dehydrated, and when I visited I took along a bottle of fancy juice, put a straw into his mouth and coaxed him to drink. The sight of liquid seeping up the straw, the sound of it against his teeth and tongue, was a wild relief. It was also one of the few ways I could reach through the bars of his catatonia cage and find a way to communicate. His fists kept flying up involuntarily and hammering on the arms of his chair. I held his hands tight and spoke to him of better times, when he would be well again it was also a way of reassuring myself. The last time he’d had a catatonic collapse, he’d taken months to heal. There was no certainty that he would recover on this occasion.“Are you his carer?” It was a question that I kept being asked around this time. I usually replied: “Well, no, I’m his daughter.” I found the term carer puzzling and wondered why people were trying to pin it on to me. It made me think of nurses, white gowns, Florence Nightingale it made me feel I ought to have specialist medical knowledge and infinite reserves of compassion. Of course, I did care about my father I was desperately worried about him. But I did not consider myself as someone worthy of an official title of responsibility. I was in my late 30s, based in the north, a full-time writer, living a peripatetic, financially precarious existence. My father was in his early 70s and lived in London, alone after the death of my mother, his days bookended by the taking of medicines and filled with quiet habits: reading the paper, doing the odd shop, cooking himself a poached egg for dinner each night.He fell ill when I was three years old. He had always been a playful, loving father. Subsequently he seemed lost to us. He had been sectioned after being made redundant and suffering a nervous breakdown during his stay in the psychiatric ward, he developed schizophrenia. Open a textbook and you’ll find a list of symptoms for the illness – withdrawal, loss of desires, hallucinations, hearing voices – but it affects each person differently. For us, there was a sense of my father withdrawing from the world, becoming a silent, mysterious observer, almost wraithlike.With my father now back in the psychiatric ward, I tried to visit him every day. I liaised with doctors, played Scrabble with him, read to him from the paper, took bags of his clothes home, washed them, carried them back. The nights grew shorter, daffodils springing up on the lawns that framed the ward. The day he started speaking again was euphoric: the first major sign of recovery. Before my mother had died, my relationship with him had been virtually non-existent. Now I found myself becoming closer to him, discovering what a kind and sweet man he was beneath his quiet persona. A tenderness blossomed between us.As he grew better, I went into decline. My workload was heavy. By the end of each day I wanted to curl up foetal in bed with exhaustion, and the walk to the bus stop, the start of my journey to visit him, became a trudge.It was a lonely time. My partner of three years was based in the north, anchored there by his daughter from a previous relationship. Insomnia set in. I would wake in the early hours, worried about Dad, about work deadlines I was failing to meet on four or five hours sleep I fumbled through white-fuzz days. If I was a carer, I thought, then I’m failing at this task. It was a relief when, one night on the ward, I heard a man cheerfully saying to his sick wife: “I’m glad they’ve let me change my shifts, when I was on night duty visiting you every day nearly killed me.” Eventually, I cut back on work in order to devote more time to my father, but then my finances suffered. Bankruptcy became a genuine threat.When my father was released, the relief came: now life can go back to normal. But a few months later, I was working downstairs at the dining table when I heard the sound of water pitter-pattering on the floor. My father had been at the sink, washing his hands, when he collapsed into catatonia. As I returned to a routine of visits and doctors’ discussions, my relationship collapsed. By choosing to stay south for the past year, I had put my father ahead of my boyfriend. It had not felt like a conscious decision. Caring had always felt like something that happened to me, not a choice I’d made. I realised that life was never going to be “normal” again.My father is much better these days, for I have moved in with him permanently. There are times when I feel sad about my love life being compromised, days when I wish I had the freedom to travel or live abroad, but I cherish the close bond between us and the fierce, protective love for him that has taken root in my heart. Being called a carer is something I have grown used to.• Sam Mills is author of The Fragments of My Father: A Memoir of Madness, Love and Being a Carer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a24eaa88bd797eb0a5319c38d4e664a7019d5776/0_338_3097_1858/master/3097.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cbc7d2174115f6dba70a0ac9c7f940b","title":"cricket england pakistan second test day one live","story":"20th over: Pakistan 52-1 (Abid Ali 30, Azhar Ali 13) Azhar brings up the fifty with yet another nudge to leg. Woakes has been a touch too straight, but he realises it and finishes the over by beating Azhar with a classic outswinger.Dave Epsley is picking up the thread on hair replacement (7th over). “That Gough-Warne anti-slaphead advert is amazing,” he says. “Cheers me right up every time it comes on. As well as the wooden dialogue, it’s obvious (to me anyway) that they were filmed separately, perhaps even on opposite sides of the world. They’ve clearly been given a spot to look at for eyeline purposes, but it’s not *quite* right. Hilarious!”19th over: Pakistan 49-1 (Abid Ali 28, Azhar Ali 12) Abid confirms his recovery with a crisp on-drive for three off Curran. Root reacts by shifting Dom Sibley out of the slips and sticking him at short midwicket, where he may be able to pull off another run-out. That direct hit at Old Trafford was the most stylish moment in his Test career. Not saying a great deal, but still, it was beautifully done.18th over: Pakistan 45-1 (Abid Ali 25, Azhar Ali 11) Woakes beats Abid’s inside edge and raps him on the box. Ouch. The poor guy is on his knees, then being attended to by the physio, but he rallies to resume his stout defence and there’s yet another single as England, not for the first time, stray onto leg stump.Here’s Damian Burns, our man in St Helena. “Given your description of the humidity, could sweaty palms be to blame for the two early drops? Or is that giving England too much of an excuse…?” That could be it, but for international cricketers, sweaty palms surely shouldn’t come as a shock.17th over: Pakistan 44-1 (Abid Ali 24, Azhar Ali 11) Curran is probing away with his full length, but when he finds the edge of Azhar’s bat, it bounces before it reaches Joe Root – currently England’s only reliable slip catcher.“With all that white sun block,” says Brian Withington, “Rory Burns looks like a bit of a Marcel Marceau tribute act. Catches like one, too. Looking forward to his man-in-a-strong-wind impersonation later.”“ scoreboard,” notes Paul Akhurst, “shows Pakistan with four current batsmen. Is this a new innovation to counter the swinging ball?”16th over: Pakistan 43-1 (Abid Ali 23, Azhar Ali 11) Woakes bowls a maiden, and suddenly all is right with the world.15th over: Pakistan 43-1 (Abid Ali 23, Azhar Ali 11) Curran still fancies the yorker, but Azhar is alert to it and able to steal a single into the on side. Tim Sanders has been studying Anderson. “Jimmy always used to seem so taken with the angle across the left-hander to the waiting slip cordon, that he never seemed to bother with getting them LBW with the inswinger. Whereas if you think of the mirror image, left-arm-over swing bowler to right-hander, LBW is the classic mode of dismissal. I think in the past couple of years, Jimmy has been more willing to home in on the stumps. Also, I’m treasuring the image of steam coming into his ears, thank you. You won’t see that on the telly.” Ha, thanks. The commentators do seem strangely resistant to quoting our quips. 14th over: Pakistan 41-1 (Abid Ali 22, Azhar Ali 10) Abid had just played another glance for four, so Woakes’s figures are 2-0-12-0. You might assume that Mr Immaculate was having a mare, but then bowling figures don’t show dropped catches. And that’s drinks, with Pakistan probably the happier team. England have bowled well and fielded atrociously, while the two Alis have ridden their luck and been very purposeful.Another one bites the turf. This time it’s Burns at second slip. Like the one Sibley shelled, it’s shoulder-high and to his left. He seems to do everything right, but out it pops and Jos Buttler can’t quite snaffle the rebound.13th over: Pakistan 36-1 (Abid Ali 17, Azhar Ali 10) Curran drops a bit short, allowing Azhar to flick for two, then fires in a fine yorker which is like Wasim Akram in slow motion. As Curran is a gentle 80mph, Azhar jabs the bottom of the bat down in time.12th over: Pakistan 34-1 (Abid Ali 17, Azhar Ali 8) It’s a double change as Root sends for Chris Woakes, the king of the chasers. Straightaway, his outswinger is curving like his Alice band, but there are runs to be had as Abid pushes into the covers for two and leg-glances for four.11th over: Pakistan 27-1 (Abid Ali 11, Azhar Ali 7) And here is Curran, replacing Anderson: the king of the swingers giving way to the prince. He’s on the spot but again the batsmen are busy, nudging for a single apiece. Curran’s hair is so long at the front and short at the back that he may soon be asked for Brandon Williams’s autograph.George the Cornish mason’s plea for the TMS link is kindly answered by Andrew Harrison. “Easy to find via BBC website,” he says, “impossible if you search YouTube.”10th over: Pakistan 25-1 (Abid Ali 10, Azhar Ali 6) Broad may not be feeling great but there’s no way he’s going to hand this glossy new ball to Woakes or Curran. He keeps on bending it past the outside edge, then brings one back in to rap Abid on the thigh pad. A single to each batsman, and Broad has 5-2-7-0 while Anderson has 5-1-10-1. Classic stuff.9th over: Pakistan 23-1 (Abid Ali 9, Azhar Ali 5) A single to Azhar, getting wristy with his leg glance. Pakistan have done pretty well to lose only one wicket here. Broad seems to be signalling for an inhaler, but Mark Wood, unlucky to be 12th man again, trots out with three water bottles.8th over: Pakistan 22-1 (Abid Ali 9, Azhar Ali 4) The air is so steamy that even Broad is now a swing bowler like his old mate. His inswinger eludes both Abid and Jos Buttler, who concedes four byes there was a sound but it was bat on pad. Then the outswinger beats the outside edge.7th over: Pakistan 18-1 (Abid Ali 9, Azhar Ali 4) Abid’s turn to push for two, off Anderson, before he squirts a single off an inside edge. Sky go straight from Shane Warne commentating to Shane Warne advertising hair replacement, joining Darren Gough in possibly the most wooden bit of dialogue ever written. This is so subversive, it’s superb.Talking of commentary... “Yawn of a request,” says George Murphy. “Can you beg your OBOians for the overseas TMS link? Hard to fathom why but standard web searches never reveal its hiding place. Then again I am an undeniable fool of a techno-loser. Please excuse the tedious request but simultaneous reading and chiselling is a skill I have yet to master. From a Cornish mason in sunny Stavanger.” A lot to unpack there.6th over: Pakistan 15-1 (Abid Ali 6, Azhar Ali 4) Broad beats Azhar with a leg-cutter, and with an outswinger, but when he brings one back, looking for that lbw, Azhar manages a tuck for two. And then a straight push for another two. If the Pakistanis’ techniques are struggling with the moving ball, their temperaments are in good order.5th over: Pakistan 11-1 (Abid Ali 6, Azhar Ali 0) A boundary! Anderson keeps pitching it up, as you would, and Abid is calm enough to spot a half-volley and ease it through the covers.4th over: Pakistan 7-1 (Abid Ali 2, Azhar Ali 0) That dropped catch yielded a single, the only run Broad has conceded so far. He’s bowling every ball as if still making a point about his omission here last month. It’s all happening. Abid gets a chunky nick and Dom Sibley, at third slip, can only parry a shoulder-high chance as Rory Burns, at second, goes for it too. The commentators point out that Stokes would normally be at second, with Burns at third, but even Stokes has been dropping a few lately.3rd over: Pakistan 6-1 (Abid Ali 1, Azhar Ali 0) So Anderson strikes early and Masood follows his majestic 156 with scores of 0 and 1. And in comes Azhar, the captain, who is in no sort of form. Another lbw cannot be ruled out.Oh Jimmy Jimmy! It’s full, it’s swinging back into the left-hander, it’s hitting middle and it’s not even worth a review. That is wicket no. 591 for England’s most prolific seamer. Who on earth said this man should be left out?2nd over: Pakistan 6-0 (Shan Masood 1, Abid Ali 1) You’ll never guess who’s sharing the new ball with Anderson. Yes, it’s Stuart Broad, who was infamously discarded for the last Test on this ground. He too beats Abid Ali, with bounce more than movement. Poor old Abid is making a strong bid for a role that now seems to be a staple of the English summer: the visiting opener who becomes a walking wicket.1st over: Pakistan 6-0 (Shan Masood 1, Abid Ali 1) Masood pushes the first ball for a single. Anderson immediately beats Abid Ali with a ball that goes like a leg-cutter. Abid picks up a single too, trying to leave one, and then there are four leg byes as Shan shapes to glance. “So Fawad hasn’t played a Test since 2009,” says Peter Williams. “Does that mean his nickname should be Fast Fawad?”Joe Root has so much faith in Jimmy Anderson, he’s even giving him the new ball. If Chris Woakes wasn’t so genial, he might be seething.“Brave of Azhar,” says Felix Wood, “to win the toss given what has happened in the other four Tests this summer.” Good spot! Every loser wins. “Not sure about the Archer decision – it really does feel that Root hasn’t quite worked out how to best use him.” Very true. As my colleague Rob Smyth observed the other day, Jofra looks as if he could do with a dose of Eoin Morgan. “Fawad Alam plays his first Test for 11 years,” says Simon Wilde of The Sunday Times on Twitter. “He’s sat out the last 88 Tests, so should be fully rested.”Sure enough, Shadab Khan gives way to Fawad Alam, as Azhar feels that one leggie will do, and Zak Crawley stands in for Ben Stokes. It’s Sam Curran rather than Mark Wood who replaces Jofra Archer, so England are willing to sacrifice velocity for better batting – though Curran does bring a touch of Stokes’s ability to make things happen. “Feels like it could swing,” says Joe Root. It may need to, given England’s lack of pace.Azhar Ali does a Stokes and decides to bat first, even though the pitch has some grass on it. He and Joe Root remember to bump elbows, a social ritual that always seems to make people smile.Morning everyone and welcome to the second Test. When Chris Woakes and Jos Buttler pulled off their thrilling heist on Saturday, they secured something that has become almost unheard-of for international cricketers: a Sunday off. Now England’s players and their Pakistani guests may be about to enjoy a few more breathers. In the Met Office forecast for this match at Southampton, every one of the five days carries a yellow warning. The South of England is so humid that we may see the first recorded case of steam going into Jimmy Anderson’s ears.There will be rain, and it looks like being torrential. But there should be sunny spells too. It feels like a day for bowling at the ground where Ben Stokes fluffed his lines by opting to bat in the first Test of the summer. England’s Test team, who have a 100-per-cent record at Old Trafford this year, have a 0-per-cent record at the Ageas Bowl. It would be good for the game if they could maintain that. Wherever your allegiance lies, 1-1 with one to play is a lot more fun than 2-0. This Pakistan side, with their spirit and spark, hardly deserved to leave Manchester empty-handed. As his father is unwell, England will have to do without Stokes for the first time since the Lord’s Test against India in 2018, when Chris Woakes borrowed his cape and belted a hundred. Stokes’s place almost certainly goes to Zak Crawley, who was the fall guy for the last two Tests when Superman was ruled unfit to bowl. The consolation for Crawley is that he will be returning to the scene of his most commanding performance for England, 76 against West Indies a month ago. If England are still rotating, Mark Wood or Sam Curran – or even the highly promising Ollie Robinson – should come in for Jofra Archer. But then if they really believed in rotation, they would have brought Jack Leach in for Dom Bess, and given Anderson a game off.Pakistan are expected to stick with ten of the XI who made the running at Old Trafford. Shadab Khan, whose counter-punching 45 played a big part in that, may have to make way for Fawad Alam, who’s a rare bird in Pakistan cricket having reached the age of 34 with only three Test caps. He would stiffen the batting and be a second left-hander to go with Shan Masood, the man whose 156 dwarfed all the other scores on the doors. Play starts at 11am, all being well, with the toss at 10.30.

Under an image of two women it said: “Mutual understanding beyond words. Witness our everlasting friendship.”With a photograph of the two men it said they were father and son. When it was pointed out the men were very close in age, another text was posted that said: “Father and son are like brothers.”One internet user said: “It’s weird to use a ring to explain the relationship between father and son.” They added that it appeared they were obviously meant to be a couple.“They look three years apart in age at most. Also, I’ve never heard of fathers and sons wearing matching rings,” said another on Weibo.Others decried China’s censorship, saying such actions “obliterate the value of all cultures”.“The campaign was much better when it stayed in the area of ambiguity. Now it makes me feel like being gay is something to be ashamed of,” said a Douban user after the static ads were posted.Homosexuality is not illegal in China, but it was officially listed as a mental disorder until 2001. LGBTQI rights still occupy a fraught space and discrimination is common. Since 2017 TV and online portrayals of what the censors consider to be “abnormal sexual behaviours”, including same-sex relationships, have been banned by the China Netcasting Services Association.Cartier’s Trinity ring was designed in 1924, with the three intertwined bands of different metals symbolising different aspects of a relationship. Despite recent campaigns calling on wearers to “give your own meaning to Trinity”, after more than 80 years it remains associated with romance and engagements.The ad was released just weeks before Qixi festival, China’s equivalent of Valentine’s Day.Yanzi Peng, the director of the China Rainbow media awards, told CNN businesses should be “more courageous”, but also suggested the Cartier ad may have been made to contribute to LGBTQI visibility while getting past the censors.Sup China reported that previous ads which pushed the censors’ envelope were warmly received by viewers.Cartier has been contacted for comment.• Additional reporting by Pei Lin Wu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb146c723e820087cb3bb446570387049f6976b3/127_0_3746_2249/master/3746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63100cc841f156a4c0ac4b47e76d5227","title":"greek military put on high alert as tensions with turkey rise","story":"Dispute over exploration of energy reserves in eastern Mediterranean escalates Greece has placed its military forces on high alert, recalling its naval and air force offers from holiday, as tensions with Turkey over exploration of potentially lucrative offshore energy reserves escalate in the eastern Mediterranean.With Ankara dispatching the Oruç Reis, a drillship escorted by gunboats, to conduct seismic research in contested waters, Athens stepped up calls for Turkey to stop the “illegal” activities, intensifying a diplomatic offensive that has prompted the US, EU, France and Israel to express their growing anxiety over the situation.Amid the mounting international concern, Mitsotakis on Thursday thanked Emmanuel Macron, calling him a “true friend of Greece and fervent protector of European values and international law” after the French president demanded Turkey halt its explorations and said he would reinforce France’s military presence in the area.France’s armed forces ministry confirmed it was dispatching two Rafale fighter jets and a naval frigate to the eastern Mediterranean after Macron voiced grave concern over the situation in a call with Mitsotakis the previous day.Turkey’s prospecting should “cease in order to allow a peaceful dialogue” between the neighbouring Nato members”, Macron tweeted in a strong statement, describing the situation as “preoccupying” and blaming Turkey’s “unilateral decisions” for mounting tensions.France would “temporarily reinforce” its military presence, he said, to “monitor the situation in the region and mark its determination to uphold international law”. Last month Macron called for EU sanctions against Turkey for what he described as “violations” of Greek and Cypriot sovereignty over their territorial waters.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, described the mobilisation of naval forces as “extremely worrying” in a statement as the bloc scrambled to arrange an emergency foreign affairs council for Friday.Greece’s foreign minister Nikos Dendias will also meet his US counterpart, Mike Pompeo, in Vienna on Friday for talks focusing on what Dendias described as “developments in the eastern Mediterranean in light of Turkey’s escalating violations of international legality.”In an abrupt move, the Turkish navy issued a navigational advisory, or Navtex, early on Monday stating the Oruç Reis would be carrying out the exploratory search in the disputed area until 23 August. The communique came as the country also launched naval exercises in the region.At the height of summer, with tourists once again heading to Greek island resorts and beaches, diplomats in Athens are eager the standoff is defused peacefully. But as warships coalesce, the spectre of conflict being triggered by a miscalculated move is also real, analysts say.“On a scale of one to 10, I would say bilateral tensions are at a level of seven to eight,” international relations professor, Constantinos Filis, told the . “This could easily erupt into the most serious crisis between Greece and Turkey in almost 25 years. Room for human error is very real if Turkey continues on this path of revisionist brinkmanship.”It was, he added, “simply illegal” to conduct seismic research in waters that had neither been defined by an agreement nor the verdict of an international court.Tensions over delineation of territorial waters have long festered between Greece and Turkey. But as the dispute worsened this week, the rhetoric also went up a notch.Dendias insisted Athens’ centre-right government would have no choice but to defend the country’s territorial integrity if maritime boundaries were breached in the race to tap regional energy reserves.On the other side of the Aegean, the Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, similarly vowed that Ankara would protect “its rights, ties and interests” in coastal areas. “Despite all this, we want to believe that common sense will prevail … it should be known that our seas are our blue homeland. Every drop is valuable,” Akar told Reuters.Competing maritime claims have revolved around the failure of both Greece and Turkey to agree on exclusive economic zones in shared seas.Athens maintains its islands – no matter how small – have their own continental shelves Ankara argues that, if upheld, the Aegean would effectively be turned into a Greek lake, which, say Turkish diplomats, is utterly unacceptable to a country that sees itself as a regional power and has no intention of being left out of any energy bonanza.The discovery of deep sea gas fields, first off Egypt and then Israel and Cyprus, has proved the eastern Mediterranean to be rich in natural resources – even if, in the case of Cyprus, hydrocarbons are still a long way from being extracted from the seabed.Egypt and Israel have found enough gas reserves to become energy sufficient for the foreseeable future.Last month, in an incident described as a “very near miss” by senior Greek officials, the two neighbours almost came to blows after Ankara announced it was dispatching the Oruç Reis to the same disputed area south of the Aegean isle of Kastellorizo for 10 days of oil and gas exploration. Resolution came at the 12th hour when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, intervened, appealing to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in a telephone call to halt the operation. Erdogan pulled back, ordering the drillship to remain in port and agreeing to let diplomacy run its course by holding informal talks with Athens to finally settle the issue of maritime delimitations between Greek islands and mainland Turkey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef8f83d26ad742b95296114f484dee37cf70a67f/0_273_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0044100292beecec0d6a7ac57ea46206","title":"beirut explosion devastates sursock palace and museum in pictures","story":"Among the many homes and buildings damaged by the Beirut explosion were the Sursock Museum and Palace.

US regulators approved a joint Covid-19 and flu test in July.The same people who are most vulnerable to risks from Covid-19, such as the elderly and those with respiratory conditions, are also at greatest risk for the flu, Tan added.There is evidence that social distancing measures for Covid-19 reduce the transmission rate of the flu as well, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning that continued measures in the US could potentially slow flu transmission this season.CVS plans to begin inoculating patients earlier than usual - possibly by the end of this month - to get a jump start on preparing for this year’s flu season, which usually starts around October.However, studies show there is a risk that getting inoculated against the flu too early can leave a patient vulnerable to contracting the virus later on in winter, if the shot wears off.Vietnam’s health ministry reported 25 more coronavirus infections and three additional deaths on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in the Southeast Asian country to 905, with 20 fatalities.More than 430 of the total cases are linked to the central city of Danang, where the new outbreak began late last month.The ministry said 133,340 people are being quarantined in the country, including 5,361 at hospitals, 25,043 at centralised quarantine centres and the rest at home. Finland’s government backs public health authorities’ new recommendation to use facemasks on public transport and in other situations where social distancing is not possible, the country’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said.Health authorities reported 41 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, a daily record since the end of May, bringing the total to 7,683 since the beginning of the pandemic.Prior to Thursday, Finland had not officially recommended the use of masks. Black people in the US were making slight progress towards equality, but even that is being undone by the economic and social impacts of the coronavirus, according to an index of American equality released on Thursday.Research by the National Urban League, a civil rights organisation, found black Americans’ levels of equality with white people had risen slightly since 2018, aided by improvements in health and social justice.But the calculations were made before the outbreak of Covid-19, which is wiping out gains in wealth and jobs, while killing about twice as many black people as white, said the National Urban League report, titled 2020 State of Black America.Since those calculations were made, the US has grappled with the impact of the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement, which was sparked in large part by the death of George Floyd, a black man, in police custody.Marc Morial, the National Urban League president, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview:America is in crisis. Black America is in a doubly difficult crisis.You’ve got the health issues related to Covid and the disproportionality of deaths and disease, and you’ve got the economic fallout, disproportionality in terms of unemployment, the impact on businesses.The you’ve got the racial justice crisis, which was put into plain sight by the death of George Floyd.Even before the coronavirus and the economic recession, the study’s findings “reflect longstanding racial and ethnic disparities across nearly every area of American life,” the report said.Dozens of holidaymakers have been barred from boarding flights from the UK to Greece because of confusing red tape caused by the coronavirus.In July the Greek government announced that all passengers must submit a personal locator form including their travel and contact details 48 hours before departure. They are then emailed a QR code, which must be downloaded and presented at check-in.The details are used for contact tracing in the event of a Covid-19 outbreak and arrivals who fail to comply face a €500 (£452) fine.However, delays in receiving the code and differing interpretations of the rules by airlines have led to passengers being turned away at the airport.Some travellers claim their airline did not inform them of the new requirements or that minor form-filling errors cost them their holiday.Indonesia’s move to reopen schools in some areas risks creating new clusters of coronavirus cases, with at least 180 students and teachers infected since the new academic year started in July, a teachers’ federation has said.Parents can opt not to send their children to schools in these areas and extracurricular activities are not allowed.Heru Purnomo, the secretary general of The Federation of Indonesian Teachers Associations (FSGI), said distance learning was still preferable.“We’ve always sounded out our worries that schools could become new clusters,” Purnomo said. “Distance learning, be it offline or online, is safer than face-to-face lessons.”Wiku Adisasmito, a spokesman at Indonesia’s Covid-19 task force, told reporters new clusters would not break out at schools if all health protocols were adhered to.The World Health Organization in Indonesia warned that a return to schools “risks worsening local transmission, putting a heavier burden on the nation’s limited healthcare facilities and workers and, in the long term, slowing down the economic recovery”.Some provinces have reported a significant number of cases among young people. In Papua, nearly 300 people aged under 19 had confirmed infections as of Wednesday.A co-founder of Lapor Covid-19, a volunteer group collating information, told Reuters it had found six clusters originating in schools that had reopened in West Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.Greece has reported its first Covid-19 infection in one of its overcrowded asylum seeker camps, a migration ministry source said.A 35-year-old man from Yemen living at the camp of Vial on the island of Chios tested positive late on Wednesday, the source told AFP.“The man has been quarantined at the local hospital. Another 30 people are undergoing tests,” the official said.There are more than 3,800 people living inside the Vial camp, over three times nominal capacity.Several non-fatal coronavirus cases have surfaced in Greek camps on the mainland – including 150 infections at a migrant hotel in the Peloponnese in April.But this is the first case involving an island camp, where the worst overcrowding occurs.The news came a day after Greece registered its highest-ever daily number of new infections at 262.Authorities have blamed the rise in infections to the flouting of social distancing rules in restaurants, bars and public gatherings.The government this week announced a night curfew for restaurants and bars in some of its top tourist destinations, and new restrictions for incoming travellers, requiring them to produce negative tests up to 72 hours before entry.A ban on smoking on streets and restaurant terraces when social distancing cannot be guaranteed came into effect today in Spain’s northwestern region of Galicia, with other areas mulling similar restrictions.Under a law approved by the regional government of Galicia late on Wednesday, smoking in public is not allowed if it is not possible to maintain a distance of two metres between people.When he announced the measure, the head of the regional government of Galicia, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, said several experts had warned his administration that “smoking without any restrictions, including on a terrace without any limitations, with people nearby, or in crowded places, without any social distancing, represents a high risk of infection”.Officials in the southern region of Andalusia, along with those in the central regions of Castilla y Leon and Castilla La Mancha, said they were considering similar smoking restrictions.The World Health Organization has said tobacco users are likely to be more vulnerable to being infected by the virus and could increase the possibility of transmission of the disease due to increased contact of fingers with the lips.Spain’s highly decentralised system of government makes regions responsible for healthcare, leading to a patchwork of different measures to curb the virus across the country of 47 million people.The smoking ban is part of a series of new measures imposed by Galicia, best known as the destination for pilgrims hiking the Camino de Santiago, to curb the spread of Covid-19.It has already ordered the closure of bars and nightclubs, and restricted the number of people who can enter shops at the same time.With 30 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, Galicia has one of the lowest prevalence rates of the virus in Spain, one of the European nations hardest-hit by the pandemic with nearly 29,000 deaths.Sénéquier, a famous restaurant based in the French Riviera town of St Tropez, is shutting for two weeks after the discovery of two Covid-19 cases on its premises.The closure of Sénéquier highlights the challenges faced by the French tourism industry following a recent resurgence in Covid-19 cases in France.

Spire said it will swing to a pre-tax loss of between £24m and £29m in the period, compared with a £10m profit in the first half of last year.The company said it is also planning to bid for contracts which start from towards the of the year to help shorten NHS queues.Spire said in a statement to shareholders:NHS England has signalled that it expects to conduct a procurement process to tender for providers to help reduce the NHS waiting list, which Spire Healthcare expects to participate in.Growing call numbers and bookings, and indications from insurance partners, show a steady return of the private market, which, combined with strong NHS demand, provides the company with confidence for the medium term.Spire Healthcare will now be available to support the NHS to reduce waiting lists whilst growing private activity and remains committed to focusing on its private business over the medium term.Since the launch of NHS test and trace, 214,890 close contacts of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 have been reached through the tracing system and asked to self-isolate, according to official figures.Residents of the Isle of Wight, the London borough Newham, and NHS volunteer responders across England will be part of a new contact-tracing app trial, the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) has said.The app will include alerts based on postcode, QR check-in at venues, a symptom checker and a way to book tests, using Google and Apple-developed technology.Trials will start from Thursday on the Isle of Wight and with NHS volunteer responders across England, followed shortly by Newham residents, as part of the country’s NHS test and trace service.“There is no silver bullet when it comes to tackling coronavirus,” said Dido Harding, executive chair of the NHS test and trace programme.“The app is a great step forward and will complement all of the work we are doing with local areas across the country to reach more people in their communities and work towards our vision of helping more people get back to the most normal life possible at the lowest risk.”It comes after an analysis showed infection rates dropped dramatically on the Isle of Wight following the launch of an NHS contact-tracing phone app pilot, which was later scrapped in an embarrassing government U-turn.The new service will log the time and distance a user has spent near to anyone, even if they don’t know them, so it can alert them if necessary if that person later tests positive for Covid-19.DHSC has also released the most recent statistics for the test and trace service.Nobody should be put off seeking help from the health service if they need it, an NHS spokesman has said.NHS staff have worked around the clock to treat 108,000 people for coronavirus since the pandemic escalated in March, including record numbers getting help through NHS 111, whilst also providing nearly 10 million urgent tests, checks and treatment for non-Covid issues, and 85,000 treatment starts for cancer patients, in a safe way.Now that we are through the first wave, local NHS staff are restoring non-Covid services, which have the capacity to treat those needing urgent, emergency and other essential care, so nobody should be put off seeking help from the NHS when they need it, whether through NHS 111, their GP, a pharmacist or hospital.More people are now coming forward for a cancer check, with 45,000 extra referrals this month, and the key point remains that anyone who is concerned about a possible symptom should contact their GP and get a check-up.The UK’s largest charity supporting people with arthritis, Versus Arthritis, has said that those with the condition have “borne the brunt” of disruption to treatment during the pandemic.Liam O’Toole, CEO of the charity, said: The figures reveal the stark reality for millions of people with arthritis who have borne the brunt of disruption to treatment during the pandemic. Many are still without a surgery date and continuing to wait in ongoing pain and uncertainty.Waiting times before the pandemic were bad enough – though we can see more figures for June show little improvement. Urgent action is needed to prioritise joint replacement surgery as part of NHS recovery planning. Without this, people with arthritis will be left feeling that their pain is being ignored.The pain of arthritis is impossible to ignore. We need action to bring down waiting times safely and end the pain of delays.In the UK, more than 10 million people have arthritis or other similar conditions that affect joints, according to the NHS.This could directly impact on many of these people’s chances of survival. To ensure services are able to catch up we need the government to deliver the recovery plan promised and continue to address the scale of the challenge by securing more staffing and resources.”She urged people with cancer symptoms to contact their GP “to limit the potentially detrimental, long-term impacts of delays in diagnosis”.Dr Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: These are worrying times for the NHS given the threat of a second wave of Covid-19 in addition to all of the other pre-existing issues such as bed capacity, staffing, funding and social care provision.Performance remains poor and concerning and, with what we know will be a challenging winter ahead, it will take more than a token cash injection announced by the prime minister this week to make up for years of neglect.This all follows serious concerns over a decline in NHS admissions following heart attacks.London City airport has announced a “temporarily pause” to its expansion project as it waits for passenger demand to return.The airport said it is halting its £480m scheme at the end of the year as it acknowledged levels of travel seen in the pre-Covid-19 market “will take longer than initially expected” to come back.New aircraft stands, a parallel taxiway and new passenger facilities are due to be completed by this stage, but a major extension of the terminal building will be delayed.London City, close to the capital’s financial district, was the UK’s 12th busiest airport last year, handling 5.1 million passengers.It was closed for nearly three months from 25 March because of the coronavirus pandemic. The airport has since reopened, but is anticipating that passenger numbers for this year will be “well down” on the 2019 total.For the time being, we have taken the decision to focus our attention on delivering the vital additional airfield infrastructure which will provide our existing and prospective airline customers with the potential to bring new generation aircraft to this airport in greater numbers, which will be a crucial aspect of how we build a better, more sustainable airport. Completing the terminal extension and new east pier very much remains part of our future and, with the foundations for both in place, we stand ready to take those projects forward when demand returns.In the months ahead we will work with airlines and government to help restore confidence to the UK aviation market and we will continue to support our local authority and our communities as they plan for life beyond the crisis.Thanks Helen, and hello to everyone.

With NHS waiting lists are now the longest since records began (see 10.34am), more than half a million patients in England had been waiting more than six weeks for a key diagnostic test in June 2020, after having been referred by a GP.A total of 540,593 patients were waiting for one of 15 standard tests, including an MRI scan, non-obstetric ultrasound or gastroscopy. The equivalent number waiting for more than six weeks in June 2019 was 40,099.A total of almost 1.6 million attendances were recorded in July 2020, down from around 2.3 million attendances in July 2019.NHS England, which published the figures, said “significantly lower” attendances compared with the previous year were “likely to be a result of the Covid-19 response” - suggesting that people are still staying away from A\u0026ampE departments because of the coronavirus outbreak.That’s all from me for now as I scuttle back to old-school news reporting. Mattha Busby will be looking after this blog for the rest of the day, so please do send story tips to him: mattha.busby.freelance@theUK pub, restaurant and bar chains have said that sales halved in July compared with last summer after reopening for the first time after lockdown.Analysts expect to see a sharp upturn in August for venues serving food as a result of the government’s Eat Out To Help Out voucher scheme.The number of people waiting longer than 18 weeks for routine hospital treatment in England was more than 1.85 million in June - the highest since records began in August 2007.New data from NHS England shows the number of people waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in England rose to 50,536, up from 1,089 in June last year, and the highest number for any calendar month since February 2009.A total of 94,354 patients were admitted for treatment during the month, down from 289,203 in June 2019.Prof Graham Cooke, the research professor of infectious diseases and research lead at Imperial College, said the data would have “important implications” as decisions are taken to ease lockdown restrictions in England.He said the numbers are still “relatively small” as a proportion of the country’s population and show that a complete relaxation of lockdown would result in a resurgence of the virus.He told the PA Media news agency: “Clearly the numbers are still very big and that explains the high levels of mortality we’ve seen but as a proportion of the overall population it’s still relatively small, except in some groups where the prevalence is higher such as for people of Asian and black ethnicity.“But obviously it means that if we had relaxation of the lockdown completely, we wouldn’t have a very protected population so we would expect the virus to return and so I think that has implications for decisions that are made.”The study tracked the spread of infection across England after the pandemic’s first peak, with volunteers testing themselves at home between June 20 and July 13.If you’re wondering why I haven’t mentioned the ongoing row over exam grading in England and Wales, it’s because there is a special A-level results day live blog:There is an interesting piece in the Manchester Evening News today looking at whether Greater Manchester is likely to remain subject to the extra lockdown restrictions for another week.Jen Williams reports that overall, local officials want the measures to stay in place for another week — despite heavy lobbying from Tory MPs representing areas with low infection rates. They should hear later on what the government wants to do, though legally there doesn’t have to be a review of the measures until 19 August, next Wednesday.Around 2.8 million people live in Greater Manchester’s 10 boroughs, but rates vary wildly.Oldham remains the big outlier. Yesterday it recorded the highest daily infection rate in England, at more than 100 cases per 100,000, and leaders are openly worried about it becoming “another Leicester”.By contrast, Wigan has remained in single digits, roughly flat at around seven cases per 100,000. Williams suggests if any borough is released early from the extra restrictions, it will be Wigan — though probably not for another week.As Williams notes, many Greater Manchester residents travel daily across boroughs for work or play, making it hard to contain the virus. Others have jobs in neighbouring local authorities also subject to the enhanced lockdown, such as Pendle in east Lancashire and Calderdale and Kirklees over the border in West Yorkshire.“This low rate of contact tracing completion has been a challenge to our capacity to control the community spread of Covid-19 in Blackburn with Darwen,” writes Dominic Harrison in a column in the Lancashire .Welcoming the government’s recent decision to give power contract tracing powers to local authorities, Harrison says the national system just wasn’t good enough, with just three contacts recorded per positive case in Blackburn.Harrison says Blackburn is testing at a rate of 267 per 100,000 – the national average is about 94 per 100,000.Failing to trace the contacts of confirmed cases has hampered efforts to control the spread of the virus in Blackburn, writes Harrison:Yesterday the Department of Health and Social Care reduced the UK’s death toll by more than 5,000 following a review of how figures are calculated.Professor David Spiegelhalter, the Covid data guru from the University of Cambridge, suggests the old way of totting up the deaths was “ridiculous”.Talking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Spiegelhalter discussed how misleading Public Health England’s “daily dashboard” — which listed the number of positive cases and deaths in each area — is.“People have been watching this daily figure and haven’t realised how ridiculous it is,” he said.But he insisted the new calculations do not change the fact “we have done very badly and there has been a very large numbers of death”.Asked whether the previous figures unnecessarily scared the nation into staying at home and not wanting to go back to work, Spiegelhalter said: “I do think on the whole people are rather too cautious, rather too fearful, and the communication hasn’t helped in that.”Around 3.4 million people in England have been infected with Covid-19, a figure far higher than previous estimates, a study suggests.Prof Helen Ward from Imperial College, one of the lead authors, has just been on Radio 4’s Today programme discussing the study, which gave 100,000 volunteers simple finger-prick home testing kits.Asked why the entire population hasn’t been given tests so that we can all find out if we have had coronavirus — a move Boris Johnson once declared a “game changer” — Ward said:The bigger uncertainty actually is: what does it mean? I don’t think it’s a game changer because we don’t know if you have antibodies you are at reduced risk and how long, if you are at reduced risk, that lasts. So in terms of iniduals who have done this test we say: even if you are antibody positive you may still be at risk.Another day dawns and with it our indefatigable coronavirus live blog.

I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity. Everyone needs to be seen and heard.”At the heart of the Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a zine, paid for by Levi’s, celebrating voices outside the mainstream. Created jointly by the four incredible artists showcased here and four talented writers, it proves the power of expressing yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ef8771d704bcada862904664df8501847e82e/0_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=227ac5f420b32dbae7c8172587057313","title":"a platform for the unheard the brand the zine and what it all means","story":"For the young creatives involved, deciding to apply to be part of a project to create a zine in collaboration with  Labs was easy. But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance.

A new £650 million Brexit support and peace and reconciliation package for Northern Ireland was announced by British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove who was visiting the North on Friday.The funding comprises £300 million of support for the European Union’s Peace Plus programme and £355 million to assist traders in the North deal with the complications of Brexit. Of the £355 million the package involves £200 million towards a new free-to-use Trader Support Service that will assist with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.The other £155 million, according to Mr Gove’s office, will fund the development of new technology to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined.Mr Gove’s department said the “new service will be available to businesses bringing in goods from Great Britain or the rest of the world, providing guidance as well as dealing with their requirements for moving goods into Northern Ireland”. The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4323855.1596723404!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"look to lichens for dating with a difference","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Charles Fort, Kinsale, Co Cork, where the tops of the walls are home to flowering grasses, mosses and heathers.

Photograph:  David HaskellAt a distance Charles Fort in Kinsale looms up from the landscape in shades of grey stone but once you get closer you can see that its surface is actually multicoloured. Lichens crust the walls, including the bright yellow Caloplaca decipiens and the deep black Varrucaria maura. The tops of the walls are home to flowering grasses, mosses and heathers. Rather than a dead artefact it is a living habitat.Of all the organisms now living among the 17th-century walls, the lichens have probably been there the longest. Lichens are an organism made up of fungus and algae and they can live for thousands of years, growing very slowly and regularly. Recognition of their age and their regular growth rate led to the science known as “lichenometry”, pioneered in the 1950s. It uses the growth rate of lichens to determine the age of the surface that they grow on.Movement of glaciersRoland Beschel, an Austrian scientist, first suggested the use of lichens for dating. He had noticed that larger lichens appeared on older glacial moraine (the rocks left behind when a glacier retreats) and proposed that a lichen growth pattern could be used to date the movement of glaciers in the Alps. Lichenometry continues to be an important way to study the retreat of glaciers, especially now in the context of climate changes observed at the poles. Other geological events can be dated using lichens including volcanic eruptions and landslides.Lichenometry has also been extended into the realm of archaeology where it can be useful when radio carbon dating is either not possible or not likely to prove especially helpful.The technique is not without difficulty. Lichen growth rates can be affected by weather changes and the same species will grow differently in different environments (despite the fact that a single species of lichen may be found across the globe). Lichens on a surface may merge with one another, making it difficult to determine the precise size of a single specimen. Fire destroys lichen thereby “resetting” the lichenometric clock. The technique further assumes that a lichen immediately colonised the rock in question, but this may not be true.GravestonesNonetheless, lichenometry can be helpful in dating particular kinds of sites and objects when other methods of dating prove difficult. Unmarked or degraded gravestones are one useful example. A study by Brandy Luthe et al in 2018 used lichen growth to date headstones in a cemetery in Arkansas that was associated with the advance of western settlement.No documentary evidence existed about the establishment of the cemetery and some headstones were not dated. Dated headstones could be used to establish a growth curve for the relevant lichens. Lichenometry (combined with other methods) suggested that the cemetery was founded about 1800, earlier than the dated headstones.The fact that lichens need sunlight to grow is also helpful in dating. For example, a rock that has lichens on a surface not exposed to the sun suggests that the rock has been recently moved. For archaeologists studying Native American sites lichenometry can help to establish how much the form of a wall, for example, has been altered by 21st century hikers or campers moving the stones out of place.In Ireland, lichens have been used by Eoin Halpin to make an argument about the shape of portal tombs. Halpin supports the idea that the tombs were not fully covered with cairn stones by the observation of a lichen “tide mark” on the large stones forming the portal. Lichens above the mark are different than those below, suggesting that the lower parts were originally covered with cairn stones. Lichens only began growing below the tide mark after the cairn stones were disturbed.Matilda KnowlesIrish botanist Matilda Knowles dedicated many years to the study of lichens, identifying new species and publishing a book on them in 1929. Her list of lichen species found in Ireland is a compilation of her own diligent work and that of many Irish naturalists over more than a century and a half.Lichens have born silent witness to thousands of years of Irish history, colonising new surfaces as they have become available from trees in the deer park of the Castlemartyr estate, to the sea wall in Sutton, to limestone walls at Tara, to the Fort Hotel in Greencastle, to mud walls on the Circular Road in Dublin and apple trees at Ardnacrusha.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Prime minister Jacinda Ardern warns things are likely to get worse as capital locked downHundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Country needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

Photograph:  Tolga AkmenAFP via Getty ImagesSome 3.4 million people in England have been infected with Covid-19, a figure far higher than previous estimates, a study suggests.The results come from the world’s largest home testing programme to find antibodies for the coronavirus, a study involving more than 100,000 volunteers and carried out by Imperial College London. Conducted with the use of a simple finger-prick home test said to be easy and accurate enough for mass surveillance studies, the programme suggested 6 per cent of England’s population had already been infected with Covid-19 by July 13th.The 3.4 million people that represents is many times higher than the tally of known cases for the entire UK as posted by Johns Hopkins University in the US – whose aggregated numbers have become the main reference for monitoring the disease – and which listed the country’s case numbers at 315,546 as of Thursday morning.The study tracked the spread of infection across England after the pandemic’s first peak, with volunteers testing themselves at home between June 20th and July 13th.People living in London were most likely to have been infected, along with those working in care homes and health care, people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups, and people living in larger households.The programme suggested a total of 13 per cent of people living in London had Covid-19 antibodies, compared with less than 3 per cent in the southwest of England.People working in care homes (16 per cent) and health care (12 per cent) returned far higher results than people who were not key workers, at 5 per cent.The study found 17 per cent of black volunteers had antibodies, the categories of Asian and “other” ethnic minorities had 12 per cent each. The figure among white volunteers was only 5 per cent.People aged from 18-34 showed the highest incidence of antibodies, at 8 per cent, while over-65s had the lowest rate at just 3 per cent.Volunteers in the most deprived areas of the country were slightly more likely to have antibodies than those in the wealthiest areas, at 7 per cent compared with 5 per cent, while those in households of more than six or seven people (12 per cent and 13 per cent) were more likely to have had Covid-19 than those in single or two-person households (5 per cent).Smokers were slightly less likely to have antibodies than non-smokers – at 3 per cent compared with 5per cent – while 32 per cent of people with antibodies had shown no symptoms, a figure which rose to 49 per cent of those aged older than 65.Health minister Edward Argar hailed the study as an important development in Britain’s fight against coronavirus.“Large-scale antibody surveillance studies are crucial to helping us understand how the virus has spread across the country and whether there are specific groups who are more vulnerable, as we continue our work to drive down the spread of the disease,” Mr Argar said in a statement.“We don’t yet know that antibodies provide immunity to coronavirus, but the more information we can gather on this virus, and the easier we can make it for people to participate in these studies, the better equipped we will be to respond.“The British public have already played a massive part in helping to keep the country safe and I’d urge them to consider signing up to one of the many vital surveillance studies taking place over the coming months as part of our national testing effort.”The study’s authors also cautioned there was still no firm evidence the presence of antibodies meant people could not be re-infected with the virus.Professor Graham Cooke, the research professor of infectious diseases and research lead at Imperial, said: “Using the finger-prick tests suitable for large scale home testing has given us clearest insight yet into the spread of the virus in the country and who has been at greatest risk.“These data will have important implications as decisions to ease lockdown restrictions in England.” – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4329364.1597312869!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kamala harris s policy vagueness could yet be a drawback","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKamala Harris: “Looking back, it is odd that such a fancied candidate did not do better in her own presidential campaign.”  Photograph: Carolyn KasterAPJoe Biden is not 77 in the way that Mick Jagger is 77. The Democratic candidate for the White House wears the years with a heaviness that is not lost even on his enthusiasts. While he never rules out a second term, this self-avowed “bridge” to the next generation implies just the one. With its lack of travel and live events, this Covid-19 election campaign, The Campaign That Isn’t, has spared him. The grandest public office in the world will not.Kamala Harris is, then, in line to be as much co-president as vice-president of the US. In the senator for California, Biden has hired not just a running mate but an executive burden-sharer and – forgive the macabre note – a viable stand-in. Given Biden’s taste for foreign affairs, she might have space to impose herself on the domestic realm in particular. Her potential influence is vast.It is also ambiguous. Biden has chosen Harris, yes, but which one? Disaffected Republicans will hope for the tenacious prosecutor with the Third Way patter. “It’s not progressive to be soft on crime,” she said, running for district attorney of San Francisco in 2003. As California’s attorney-general, she confronted the parents of truant children more zealously than she did the state’s draconian justice system.Progressives, for their part, will expect the other Harris. This is the one who opposed the death penalty earlier than many in her party and votes well to the left in the Senate. She was the untiring scourge of Republican nominees and witnesses in that chamber.There is no disgrace in inconsistency: give me an opportunist over an ideologue. Whether he actually said it or not, John Maynard Keynes’s airy line, “When the facts change, I change my mind”, is too stifling. People’s views can evolve even where the facts do not.It is just that Harris is such a pronounced case. A 55-year-old political lifer – she has never worked in the private sector – should have some definition by now. “Enigma” is the euphemism for someone whose core beliefs are so up in the air. Were she bidding to be a ceremonial vice-president, a less maladroit Dan Quayle, we need not worry. If elected, however, she is going to matter. And therefore so do her views.Presidential campaignLooking back, it is odd that such a fancied candidate did not do better in her own presidential campaign. She was a major politician from a state with a larger economy than that of most G20 countries (and all the donors that implies). She was of mixed race in a party that draws much of its support from minorities. Her Senate performances suggested not just ruthlessness but guile.In the end, what she did not have was perceived authenticity. In fact, every candidate in the Democratic primaries who had made a late-career turn to the left, namely senators Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, flopped. Voters preferred the real thing (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren) or an unabashed moderate like the South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg. Policies mattered less than the conviction with which they were espoused.Biden ran some way to the left of his former self, but then he already commanded trust. Personal tragedy and almost 50 years in public life will do that. He had “earned” the right to stick a licked finger in the air and sense the wind’s direction.Of course, the national electorate is not the Democratic base. And had Biden named Warren or an untested mayor this week, President Donald Trump might be high-fiving campaign aides. The Biden-Harris pairing is far more daunting.Just not, in part thanks to that vagueness of hers, unbeatable. In a reptilian passage of Tony Blair’s chatty memoirs, the former UK prime minister explains how to go about negative campaigning. The classic error, he says, with the sureness of the thrice-elected, is the lurid, over-the-top attack. Swing voters learn to tune these out. What moves them is the lesser charge, expressed more in sorrow than in anger.UncertaintyTrump will never persuade Americans that Biden is a menace to the republic and “against God”. The criticism that might land is that he is too old and weak to run his presidency. Other forces will end up dominating. If one of them is a protean vice-president, a crime-hawk until she wasn’t, with changeable healthcare plans, the uncertainty is doubled. Caveat emptor.“Look, I like Joe,” a canny president might say. “But do you really know what you’re getting?” It would insinuate that Harris is an agent of the far left, but then blank canvases are there to be painted on. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"government wont trust teachers should","story":"I should have known it. Molesworth warned us that any skool is a bit of a shambles and masters are not really grown ups they are ha-ha just spoilt children, but did we listen? No. Now Ofqual has unveiled the truth: teachers, suggested Ofqual chairman Roger Taylor in the  on Sunday, are not to be trusted. I’m not sure I agree.In the first half of 2020 we faced flood, fire and pestilence. Now comes a new threat that targets only students: the Government’s regulatory body is downgrading our exam results – for exams that we were unable to sit. Not only do we have no happy sense of closure, no cheerful waving goodbye to those less likeable subjects, no chance to prove our worth in favourite subjects, but now we’re also encouraged to query our teachers’ judgment. Allowing teacher-estimated grades to stand would have resulted in perpetual unfairness between this year’s grades compared to past and future generations, argues Mr Taylor. So what good can come from this? What does Ofqual hope to achieve? If we cannot trust our teachers, who and what can we trust? How can we know for certain that the earth is flat, that πr2 is indeed the equation for calculating the area of a circle and not simply a meaningless squiggle made up minutes before the lesson started? How can we know that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is indeed the cruel dictatorship that our teachers would have us believe, and not simply a wonderful Utopia, ruled over by Kim Jong-Un the Ever-Friendly?Ofqual’s policy seems to be based on mistrust and suspicion, characteristics once viewed as un-British. It’s an unpleasant kind of person who always looks for the worst in people. The Taylor argument assumes teacher guilt, rather than teacher honesty – an unhealthy outlook with only negative implications. I wonder what teaching unions think of this demonising of teachers. Does anyone care about the long-term effects of all this – the further downgrading of teachers’ professional status, not to mention pupils’ disillusionment with school and a wider acceptance that a spiteful, untrusting approach to the world around us is just fine?The decision to moderate teacher-estimated grades ties us firmly to our past weaknesses. We have been denied the chance of a last great push and now we’ll be judged instead on exams that, historically, never mattered. Their very name, mocks, suggests they have no real value. Why, then, base our results on them? Will Ofqual’s grades take into account events that occurred during mocks that would not occur during actual GCSEs – in my case, a timetable clash between my real French oral and my Biology mock? (Funnily enough, I prioritised the French. I assume my teachers took this into account in their predictions, but Ofqual won’t.)We need to ask what message this is sending out. Answer: give up half-way, endings don’t matter, last-minute reversals are impossible. Victory can’t be snatched from the jaws of defeat in the closing minutes of the game. Johnny Wilkinson’s World Cup-winning drop-kick against Australia in 2003 was a waste of time and Henry V’s forces at Agincourt would have been wiser to have surrendered. I think we can all thank our lucky stars that it was Churchill and not Roger Taylor orchestrating the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk. Surely, having done badly in his own A-levels and then been given a second chance, Mr Taylor should know the importance of a late-in-the-day turnaround and a generous-minded system.When we have underperformed at GCSE and A-level, our possible options after school will be more limited: the best universities will be out of our reach, perhaps even our preferred job options, too. It’s hard not to be irritated that next year’s cohort will benefit from the allowances we are denied: a reduced syllabus with less coursework, possibly fewer modules, and there’s even talk of open-book exams. Mr Taylor, you’re in danger of letting us all down. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden set make first appearance running mate kamala harris","story":"Kamala Harris has used her first speech after being named as Joe Biden’s vice presidential nominee to hammer Donald Trump’s record of tackling coronavirus and speak about her own family’s immigrant backstory.The Californian senator appeared alongside Mr Biden at a campaign event for the first time since the Tuesday announcement as the pair both spoke in Wilmington, Delaware - Mr Biden’s hometown. Ms Harris, 55, said she was “incredibly honoured” to have been selected to join the Democratic Party’s presidential ticket and was “ready to get to work”. Much of the speech was spent going after the Trump administration’s record on handling the Covid-19 crisis, widely seen as one of the central issues in the November 3 election. At another she referenced her past as a prosecutor when criticising the current US president and vice president, saying: “The case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence is open and shut.Ms Harris criticised Mr Trump’s “delusional belief that he knows better than the experts” and said he had at times pushed “miracle cures he saw on Fox News, an apparent reference to hydroxychloroquine. She said that the plan to reopen schools was in “complete chaos” and that the country’s reputation was “in tatters.   “This is what happens when we elect a guy who just isn’t up for the job,” she said. At other points Ms Harris expanded on her own back story, including being the child of immigrants. Ms Harris’s mother came to America from India and her father was from Jamaica. She described how, after meeting in the United States, the pair got involved in the civil rights movement and that she was sometimes taken to protests strapped a parent\u0027s chest.Ms Harris also spoke about her friendship with Beau Biden, Mr Biden’s eldest son who died from cancer in 2015. Mr Biden had mentioned the connection in a statement announcing his choice for running mate.Ms Harris said that they got to know each other when she was attorney general for California and Beau held the same role in Delaware, saying that they would talk every day during the height of the 200909 financial crisis. As she addressed the strength of bond between Mr Biden and Beau, saying “it was the most beautiful display of the love between a father and a son”, Mr Biden listened on with his head bowed in apparent emotion. Ms Harris had taken to the podium, positioned before a row of flags of all 50 US states, after Mr Biden had given a speech praising Ms Harris’s qualities as a politician and a leader. I have no doubt that I picked the right person to join me as the next vice president of the United States of America, and that is senator Kamala Harris, Mr Biden. He added: “She\u0027s ready to do this job on day one. We\u0027re both ready to get to work rebuilding this nation.Mr Biden said he hoped that young girls of colour were looking at his vice presidential selection - Ms Harris is the first woman of colour on a presidential ticket for a major US political party - and wondering if they could lead the country. He also said of the role Ms Harris would play if she wins the November election: “I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room, to always tell me the truth, and she will, to challenge my assumptions if she disagrees, to ask the hard questions. Because that’s the way we make the best decisions for the American people.At the end of the event the politicians were joined at the front of the stage by their partners but the two couples remained socially distanced from each other, in a reminder of how the pandemic has altered the 2020 election campaign. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"standing stilton exactly ministers should","story":"The eleventh hour had passed. After days of intense negotiations, the UK’s international trade secretary, Liz Truss, was poised to sign a deal that would protect £14.8 billion of the nation’s exports to Japan. Yet no pen was dipped, no contract signed. Instead the Japanese foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, flew back to Tokyo last Friday, doubtless baffled at how the UK had taken a stand, and refused to shift, over a matter of just some 0.007 per cent of total exports to his country.That 0.007 per cent, a mere £100,000 worth of business, related to a few cheeses that might not benefit from tariff-free agreements – in particular softer cheeses such as the blue-veined Stilton.Perhaps up at 40,000 feet, Mr Motegi wondered what on earth all the fuss was about as he looked down at his tray of food, a few delicate pieces of sushi and sashimi, a tiny bowl of soy sauce, some chopped ginger. What a relief that would be after days of heavy Whitehall sandwiches and that other British cultural horror: biscuits and cheese, including that very specimen – a cheese with actual mould deliberately within it.But back in Blighty Ms Truss was being heralded as a hero by Britain’s artisanal cheesemakers I could almost hear the applause at the Nottinghamshire Cropwell Bishop creamery, where some of the nation’s finest Stilton has been produced for 70 years. I have a vast wedge of it myself, and gouged out a spoonful when I heard the news, savouring its epic combination of smooth creaminess and tart tang.The Cropwell Bishop Stilton is one part of a huge rise in British cheesemaking over recent years. From Northampton’s crumbly and creamy Cobblers Nibble to Cornish nettle-covered Yarg, it’s a key part of the great British food renaissance – one championed by Prince Charles, who once remarked that 20 years ago the only decent cheese you could get was Cheddar, adding: “The extraordinary explosion of artisan-made cheeses has been one of the most remarkable things in this country.”British cheese is now exported around the world and often beats the French in international tastings. But the bemusement of Japanese officials underlines some of the fundamental, traditional differences between British and Japanese food culture. Their preference for raw we see as basically still alive. Our fondness for cooked they view as boiled to oblivion. Compared with their nimble use of chopsticks, our keenness on crockery is distinctly uncivilised. They are as baffled by our love of dairy as we are by a map of the Tokyo subway. And they view our non-automated public lavatories as prehistoric.Yet we Brits have come a long way. And so many of us now embrace Japanese culture, particularly the food.I asked a class of kids in Clapham during a lockdown zoom lesson what their favourite food was. “Sushi,” they all chorused. OK, so they were quite posh kids, but there’s barely a shopping centre in Britain today without a sushi bar.So perhaps it’s time the Japanese – lactose intolerances notwithstanding – cast aside their historic aversion to dairy.

Advice for students​Your ultimate guide to times, grades and next steps​A number of schools in the UK have reported that they have had more than half of their grades adjusted down, according to the Association of Colleges (AoC).In a letter to Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, it called for an urgent review into the moderation process.David Hughes, chief executive of the AoC, said: Colleges with large cohorts and very stable and predictable results over time are seeing their lowest grade profile ever, particularly at the higher grades, A to C.It adds: We cannot stand by when the evidence suggests that many thousands of students may have missed out on their grades because of a systemic bias.It comes as a total of 39.1 per cent of grades in England were lowered from teachers’ predictions, data from the exam regulator Ofqual showed.The majority of grades (35.6 per cent) were lowered by one grade, while 3.3 per cent were pulled down by two grades and 0.2 per cent were bought down by three grades.Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader tweeted: Something has obviously gone horribly wrong with this year\u0027s exam results.The Government needs to urgently rethink. We need to guarantee the right to inidual appeals, the fee for appeals waived and nothing to be ruled out, including the U-turn that was forced on the Scottish Government last week.Follow the latest updates below.Abbie Cooper, an AS-level student from Cwmbran, said she was distraught after receiving two Ds and a U.The 17-year-old said: Last year I couldn\u0027t attend college a lot due to anxiety and mental health issues but any time I did a mock or a piece of work I\u0027d still get a D, a C or a B. The Ds that I did get had been improved to a B and a C at the end of the year, and my predicted at the end of the year was a B-B-B.I thought I\u0027d pretty much secured at least a C, but I checked my results this morning and it said U-D-D.Abbie, who attends Colleg Gwent, received D grades in politics and psychology and a U in biology and is now worried about what the results will mean for her university prospects.It kind of feels like they just got a number generator or a letter generator and given you a grade based on that, she said.It sucks because I need these to apply for university next year because these are my predicteds for university. How can I go anywhere with these?With more and more reports flooding in of students who were previously straight A or B students seeing their grades plummet, many parents will be wondering: how do we appeal these results?For those who have missed their grades, you have a number of options.Talk to your teachers and family about your options.

It found:Only 45 per cent of boys nationally had been encouraged to pursue Higher Education, this compares to 50 per cent of girls26 per cent of boys believe that the quality of education they received prevented them from reaching their full potential and, as a result, is holding them back in their career.However, 21 per cent of boys were encouraged to go into STEM fields at school, compared to just 12 per cent of women.Gavin Williamson has said that universities should show the maximum amount of flexibility for incoming students as they try and secure places at higher education institutions across the UK today.Ellie French, an A-level student from Basildon, accused exam boards of playing around with people\u0027s futures after her downgraded results meant she was rejected from her chosen university course.Ellie, 18, had been hoping to study history at Nottingham, but her C in history, despite A-grades in English and politics, means she was turned down and will now go through clearing.She told PA she was expecting an A at least in history and added: In all of my mocks I\u0027ve ever done, I\u0027ve never got lower than a B. I\u0027ve never ever got a C, I\u0027m always As and Bs.My school sent me my results and they also put the teacher assessed and final mock grade on it as well as our final grade, and for me history read: Final mock grade: A teacher assessment: A final grade: C.I\u0027m just really annoyed and confused. If I did the exam I would have got the grades I was meant to get. It just feels so stupid. I feel like they don\u0027t really know what they\u0027re doing.They\u0027ve really messed it up. I blame the exam boards and I think they\u0027re just playing around with people\u0027s futures.Despite university being the destination of choice for many receiving their A-levels today, university isn\u0027t necessarily for everyone.There are some alternative career paths that don\u0027t involve the commitment (and debt) of a university degree.Just 59 per cent of graduates were in full-time employment 15 months after finishing their degree, according to HESA data from 2017-18, meaning you may want to get a head start on your peers and get into employment sooner rather than later.You can read our full guide to the alternatives to university here.The President of the National Union of Students, Larissa Kennedy has said that students have not got the grades they wanted  due to a classist, racist moderation system.In an age where students have to fork out large tuition fees, the courses - like law, business and economics - that result in the highest graduate salaries are becoming increasingly attractive.While monetary earnings aren\u0027t everything in a degree, it\u0027s important to know the sorts of graduate salaries you can expect to earn after graduating - and there are some big discrepancies depending on what you choose.It is certainly true that some courses at top universities can give you some of the highest paying degrees, adding tens of thousands to the average starting salary.See if your course is one of those which could see you earning well straight out of university:You can read the full analysis here.A student who received five A* grades at A-level and plans to study medicine at Cambridge University has said she feels she cannot fully own her results as she did not sit exams this year.Ranya Kumar, 18, collected four A* grades at Norwich School on Thursday in addition to an A* in maths from last year.She said she was very happy to get the grades needed to go to Cambridge, but it was a hard feeling to know they were awarded by an algorithm.I feel that I can\u0027t fully own my results because I didn\u0027t write the exams, which is a hard feeling, said Ranya, of Norwich.This comes alongside the news  as girls outperformed boys in A-level sciences.“We are concerned that the Ofqual algorithm may well have entrenched regional disparities, based largely on the high concentration of long-term disadvantaged students and specifically ethnic groups who often perform less well on average, such as white working class young people, in schools which in a significant number of cases have been improving quickly.The percentage of awards at A and A* was already higher in London than any of the three Northern regions, but that gap has widened – by 1.2 per cent from the North West, a full percentage point from the North East and 0.7 per cent from Yorkshire and the Humber.Shadow education secretary Kate Green has called on ministers to act to end the injustice suffered by A-level students in England who had had their results downgraded. It is a huge injustice that pupils will see their results downgraded just because of their postcode, she said.Ministers must act urgently to correct the injustice faced by so many young people today. Students must be able to lodge their own appeals if they haven\u0027t got the grade they deserved and admissions teams must be forced to be more flexible.No student should see their dreams slip away because of this Government\u0027s inaction.Though there are  scenes of jubilation than we saw last year due to the pandemic and social distancing, some students still managed to go into school to collect their results.A sixth form student is embraced after receiving her A-Level results at The Crossley Heath Grammar SchoolOlivia Gaskin (centre, holding results) reacts as students at Norwich School, Norwich, receive their A-Level resultsHenry Muxworthy with his A Level results at Ffynone House SchoolBenita Stipp (centre) and Mimi Ferguson (left) react as students at Norwich School, Norwich, receive their A-Level resultsStudents burn their A-Level results at London DungeonsFor those lucky enough to have bagged a place at one of the UK\u0027s foremost universities, you may be wondering how your college compares against the rest.Here\u0027s our hand league table to tell you how yours stacks up against the competition:You can get the grips with the full interactive tool here.In his yearly message to students who didn\u0027t get the grades they wanted, Jeremy Clarkson is building a large house with far reaching views of the Cotswolds.Camilla Turner, our Education Editor , along with Dominic Gilbert and Alex Clark from our data team have crunched the numbers and found that almost 40 per cent of top grades were marked down by Ofqual:Close to 40 per cent of A-level grades were downgraded, figures show, amid calls for the Government to U-turn on its grading system.A total of 39.1 per cent of grades in England were lowered from teachers’ predictions, data from the exam regulator Ofqual showed.The majority of grades (35.6 per cent) were lowered by one grade, while 3.3 per cent were pulled down by two grades and 0.2 per cent were bought down by three grades.You can read the full story here.Grades adjusted in 2020 A-Level results from CAG assessmentToday\u0027s results are in, and it\u0027s a record high for top grades including A*s, As and overall pass rates:The proportion of candidates receiving top grades is the highest on record. A total of 27.9 per cent of entrants scored either an A or A*, up from 25.5 per cent in 2019.The overall pass rate (grades A* to E) was 98.3 per cent - again, another record high. It is up from 97.6 per cent in 2019.Girls have extended their lead over boys in the top grades. The proportion of girls who got A or higher was 28.4 per cent, 1.1 percentage points higher than boys (27.3 per cent).The most popular subject this year was maths. It was taken by 94,168 entrants, up 2.5 per cent on 2019.There were 780,557 A-levels awarded, down 2.6 per cent on last year\u0027s total (801,002) and the lowest number since 2004.Holly Cuttiford hugs her mum after receiving her A Level results at Ffynone House School in Swansea, WalesCamilla Turner, our Education Editor, explains exactly how students grades were calculated this year in the absence of exams:Ofqual, the exam regulator, is not going to publish the full statistical model that is has used to calculate grades until results day. So far, Ofqual has said which datasets will be used in the model although it has not specified the weighting that each dataset has been given.  The datasets that will be used in the statistical model include:The exam results of students who took the same subject at the same school in 2017, 2018 and 2019Prior attainment data on students at the same school in 2017, 2018 and 2019Prior attainment data on this year’s students.You can read the full piece here.According to research done by digital learning platform, Quizlet:With all this upheaval, it is likely that this cohort of students will need more mental health support than ever.Ucas figures show 316,730 of applicants from the UK have been accepted on to their first choice of course - up 2.7 per cent on the same point in 2019.The number of UK 18-year-olds taking up places has risen to 30.2 per cent. This comes despite a 1.5 per cent drop in the population of this age group in the UK.So far, 4 per cent of placed UK students are currently planning to defer starting their course, which is the same proportion as at this point last year.Along with many students confirming their places at universities across the country, many have made their parents very proud by making it into Oxford and Cambridge.For this year\u0027s students, the financial impact of the largest recession on record could be immense. After a three year degree, the hope is that they will emerge into an economy that has completely recovered from coronavirus, with jobs galore in every sector.Yet, for those worried that this may not be the case, here are some of the decisions you can make to recession-proof your choice of degree.shuttered shop fronts on an empty shopping street in London The Labour leader in his message to students that results day can be an anxious time for young people, parents and families, it has been made worse by the Government’s incompetence.The total number of students accepted on to UK degree courses has risen with 358,860 taking up places so far, up 2.9 per cent on the same point last year, initial Ucas figures show.If you\u0027re opening your results to find, to your and perhaps parents\u0027 surprise, that you\u0027ve aced your A-levels and done much better than expected, then you can find out here how to upgrade your university place.If your grades do not look quite as expected, there is still time to appeal your grades.

The third and the most stressful. What do you say to a child who is about to be given grades for exams she hasn’t even sat? How do you calm a child when the news is relentlessly bleak? This isn’t a normal pre-results fear. My daughter has already started apologising. She’s convinced her grades are going to be lowered and doesn’t want us to be disappointed in her. She’s worried about her class ranking. Who pits a group of stressed teenagers living under forced lockdown against each other? Exams were never about classroom league tables. What a great message to pass on to these anxious teenagers: that to succeed, someone else needs to fail. And fail some will - courtesy of a computer.They’ve had no final assembly, no end of school balls or parties. Their wings were clipped when they were unceremoniously kept at home. On Thursday, many children will feel they might never fly.You can read the full piece here.Highs and lows: Students collecting their A-Level results in Norwich last yearThe Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ruled out further changes to the grading system in the face of any exams backlash.He told Times Radio: What is clear to me is there will be some youngsters, no matter how much we try to do in terms of this system to maximise the fairness of it, who don\u0027t get the grade they should have potentially have got.That\u0027s why we need to have a really robust system, that\u0027s why we\u0027ve got the triple lock.Asked if he was prepared to change the system again amid threats of legal action from parents, Mr Williamson replied: We\u0027re not going to be changing this system again.Secretary of State for Education Gavin Williamson Good morning.

Yet few policymakers here seem to have taken on board the risk of a geopolitical explosion at sea between France and Turkey.The two estranged NATO allies are jousting for influence and energy resources from Libya to Cyprus. France is sending out warships and fighters as the war of words between President Macron and his Turkish bête noire, Recep Erdogan, intensifies.France is backing Greece and Cyprus with a show of force as Turkish warships escort a Turkish drilling ship into waters claimed by the two EU states. That Turkish exploration vessel is named in honour of the great Ottoman pirate and slaver, Oruc Reis, whose rampages ranged as far as the French coast from his Algerian base. The symbolism of its name is obvious. High summer ought to be holiday season around the Mediterranean but the buzzing of fighter jets increasingly disturbing.Our Foreign Office provides travel advisories for danger zones, but its advice about Greek islands in the frontline in sight of the Turkish coast is about the marginal risk of Covid-19 not war. If Whitehall had given travel advice in August 1914, it probably wouldn’t have noticed the unusually busy trains on German railways heading towards Belgium. Post-Brexit Britain has its own problems with France over cross-Channel illegal migration, but President Macron is showing how an independent foreign policy might look.Don’t let President Macron’s rhetoric about defending the European Union’s borders and sovereignty mislead you. The reality is that Greece and Cyprus are looking to France as a great power ally. The rest of the EU maybe good for a statement of support and even a threat of sanctions but when it comes to possible use of force only France counts. Paris has military power. Brussels has words. Britain still has two sovereign bases on Cyprus which is in the eye of the storm. Turkish troops still occupy the northern half of the island. Ankara remembers  the crisis of 1974 when Turkey intervened in Cyprus. Britain remained passive despite being a guarantor of Cyprus and its constitution.That was at the low point of our post-war decline. Yet today, Harold Wilson rather than Margaret Thatcher, let alone Winston Churchill, seems to be the guiding spirit of British policy towards the gathering storm in the Eastern Mediterranean. British expats and tourists in Cyprus might continue to enjoy a quiet life if the tensions lift, but there is little sign that London is alert to the risks to them and our military there.Nonchalance in a crisis can be an impressive pose, but the lassitude gripping British foreign policy this mid-summer is a symptom of a deeper confusion in Whitehall about what this country’s role should be around the world post-Brexit. It is not a conscious retreat to a “Little England” outlook. That would be a policy. Instead passivity seems a substitute for knowing what Britain wants and how it can achieve that. President Macron may be stretching France’s resources thin but he is purposeful.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"level results day grades contest mock exam ucas university clearing","story":"Close to 40 per cent of A-level grades were downgraded, figures show, amid calls for the Government to U-turn on its grading system.A total of 39.1 per cent of grades in England were lowered from teachers’ predictions, data from the exam regulator Ofqual showed. The graph below shows the breakdown.The majority of grades (35.6 per cent) were lowered by one grade, while 3.3 per cent were pulled down by two grades and 0.2 per cent were bought down by three grades.This year 27.6 per cent of A-levels were graded as A or A*, which is a 2.4 increase on last year and is the highest proportion of top grades since 2001.But, as pupils around the country received their A-level results, the Government faced growing calls for it to abandon its grading system which was largely based on using a statistical model as well as a rank order drawn up by teachers.Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that while there has been an overall increase in top grades, headteachers are “very concerned that this disguises a great deal of volatility among the results at school and student level”.He went on: “We have received heartbreaking feedback from school leaders about grades being pulled down in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable. They are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on their students.“We are now calling on the government and the exam regulator Ofqual to review the situation as a matter of urgency, and we would warn them against simply digging in their heels, and insisting all is well.The Sixth Form Colleges Association said: “The process for calculating this year\u0027s A-level results appears to have fundamentally failed, based on our survey of sixth form colleges”The association said that the Government and Ofqual “must now revert to teacher-assessed grades”.Read more: A-level results day 2020 - live updatesThis year’s grades have been calculated by a statistical model - which took into account various factors including pupils\u0027 past performance as well as their school’s historic grades – combined with the rank order drawn up by teachers.The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) came up with model to calculate grades and teachers were asked to put students in a rank order of best to worst.Earlier this week, the education secretary apologised for the disruption students have faced but refused to back down over the use of an algorithm to calculate A-level results.Gavin Williamson said that if teachers’ predictions were awarded to pupils unaltered, grades would “shoot up” and the qualifications would be “devalued”.On Wednesday evening he made an eleventh hour change to the system which meant that pupils can now appeal against their grade on the basis of their mock exam results.It was the latest in a series of last minute changes to the appeals system ahead of results day and followed a major U-turn by the Scottish Government which threw Whitehall into a panic about how to head off a similar crisis.John Swinney, the education minister, announced on Tuesday that the 124,564 grades that had been downgraded by their algorithm would be withdrawn and replaced with teachers’ recommendations.The Welsh education minister Kirsty Williams pledged to introduce a “safety net” whereby students would not get a lower A-level grade than their AS mark.Unlike in England, where AS levels were axed under a series of reforms to “toughen up” A-levels, they remain in place in Wales meaning they can be relied on as an indicator of a pupil’s performance in exam conditions.Read more: A-level results day guide to clearing, grades and next stepsMr Williamson gave his assurance on Thursday that he will not make the same exams grade U-turn as was seen in Scotland.What is clear to me is there will be some youngsters, no matter how much we try to do in terms of this system to maximise the fairness of it, who don\u0027t get the grade they should have potentially have got, he said.That\u0027s why we need to have a really robust system, that\u0027s why we\u0027ve got the triple lock.Mr Williamson said this would provide robust grounds of appeal and allow pupils to take exams later in the year if required.But despite claims that Ofqual has no system in place for assessing the validity of mock exam results, the Education Secretary said there was a whole range of routes that schools can take the appeal process through, adding that the mock exam was an important step forward to ensure there\u0027s enhanced fairness for all pupils right across England.He said more information about appeals would be released to schools and colleges over the next few days.Languages and mathematics saw the highest proportion receiving the top grades amid a fall in the total number of entries sitting.Two thirds (66.1 per cent) of those sitting modern languages other than French, Spanish and German received either A* or A, up 15 percentage points on last year.For further mathematics it was 61.8 per cent, up 8.3 percentage points on last year.Some of the subjects receiving lowest proportion of the coveted top grades were English language (11.4 per cent), media, film and TV studies (13.8 per cent) and business studies (15.2 per cent).The 2019 A-Level cohort saw the proportion of entries among girls sitting the three main science subjects - biology, chemistry and physics - overtake boys for the first time since 2011.That trend has continued, with the gap between the genders widening in 2020.The proportion of entries into the sciences among girls rose from 50.3 per cent in 2019 to 50.9 per cent in 2020.But overall entries into sciences mirror the wider trend, with falling numbers of entries across the board.Around 10,000 fewer entries were made among girls in 2020 across the sciences among girls from the previous year, and 11,000 fewer entries among boys.More girls are sitting biology (38,067 entries among girls vs 21,406 among boys) and chemistry (28,120 vs 23,730 boys), but more boys are still sitting exams in physics (7,997 girls vs 26,999 boys).But girls achieved higher than boys in physics, with 33.7 per cent achieving A* and A, versus 29.8 per cent among boys.Girls also performed better in biology (25.3 per cent achieving the top grades vs 23.7 per cent for boys), but boys did best in chemistry (32.1 per cent for boys vs 28.9 per cent for girls).Overall, girls made up 55.4 per cent of all A-Level entries in 2020, up from 55 per cent in 2019 and 2018.It has been the best year for attainment among both boys and girls, with the former achieving 27.1 per cent A* and A (up 1.9pp on 25.2 per cent in 2019) and the latter achieving 28 per cent A and A* (up 2.9pp from 25.1 per cent in 2019). More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 13th august 2020","story":"A rare full circle rainbow captured while flying above the  island volcano Haleakala.

The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

climactic velociraptor sceneAn eagle-eyed fan has noticed a blunder in the beloved 1993 movie Jurassic Park, 27 years after the film’s release.The error comes in the famous scene when velociraptors hunt down Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello) in one of the park’s kitchens.Posting on the MovieDetails Reddit sub-forum, the viewer wrote: “In Jurassic Park, there is a scene where the raptor opens the door to the kitchen and you can spot an operator grab the raptor’s tail.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the film, the dinosaurs were created through a mixture of CGI and puppetry. Just as the Reddit user described, it is indeed possible to glimpse an operator’s hand just as the shot is panning away from the raptor.While other Reddit users expressed surprise at the discovery, errors like this are common in films. IMDb has identified 341 goofs in Jurassic Park, many of which are to do with continuity. Sam Neill: ‘Science was neglected, and that’s biting us on the arse’Jurassic Park actor Sam Neill says new film is ‘best yet’Certain errors in major films have become infamous over the years, such as the appearance of a white van during a battle scene in Braveheart, or the presence of bullet holes in a scene in Pulp Fiction before guns have been fired.In another Jurassic Park scene, the untrustworthy Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is seen talking to someone by “video link”, but viewers are able to clearly discern that he is simply watching a pre-recorded video.The lead stars of Jurassic Park – Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern – are set to reprise their roles in the upcoming Jurassic World: Dominion, which recently resumed filming, having been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Political correctness has grown to become the unhappiest religion in the world.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe argued that while political correctness started out as an “honourable” attempt at a more equitable society, it now embodies the “worst aspects” of religion, such as moral certainty and self-righteousness.Cave added: “Cancel culture’s refusal to engage with uncomfortable ideas has an asphyxiating effect on the creative soul of a society. Compassion is the primary experience – the heart event – out of which emerges the genius and generosity of the imagination.”He continued: “Creativity is an act of love that can knock up against our most foundational beliefs, and in doing so brings forth fresh ways of seeing the world. This is both the function and glory of art and ideas. A force that finds its meaning in the cancellation of these difficult ideas hampers the creative spirit of a society and strikes at the complex and erse nature of its culture.”Cave concluded the post by asking what essential values people are at risk of forfeiting in the fight for a more equal society.CeeLo Green criticises Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion and Nicki MinajMiranda Hart woke up face to face with a fox who entered her houseHis comments come a month after a group of 150 writers, academics and activists, including JK Rowling, Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood, signed an open letter objecting to cancel culture and decrying “a vogue for public shaming and ostracism”.Ricky Gervais also recently called out the phenomenon, saying: “You shouldn’t have to go to court for telling a joke.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.At the Tommyfield Market in Oldham – the Greater Manchester town now on the front line of the UK’s battle with coronavirus – on Wednesday morning, there was frustration and fear in equal measure.Frustration because of an overnight council warning that, after weeks of increasing infection rates, the borough may be just “days away” from becoming the first place in England returned to lockdown. “How did they let it get to this?” asked one person.But fear too. Fear most of all perhaps. Fear that if pubs, restaurants, leisure centres and non-essential businesses in this historic mill town really do have to shut again for a prolonged period, it could cripple the entire area – for years to come.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Look around,” said Dale Robinson, owner of Blooming Dale’s florists in Tommyfield. “Oldham’s been struggling for decades. Now this. There’s a lot of shops here that just about survived the first lockdown. They’ve scraped through. But a second one…”A shake of his head. A glance down Albion Street where empty units are already dismally plentiful.“I don’t know if there’d be much of a town to come back to afterwards,” he concludes.That Oldham has had a difficult modern history, few would argue.The destruction of both its mill industry in the Seventies and Eighties and then its engineering base in the Nineties was followed from 2010 by an especially eviscerating austerity: some 42 per cent of the council’s budget was cut here in a decade.The result has been huge levels of hardship. Four wards within the Oldham Council area are in the top one per cent of the country’s most deprived. Three of England’s 20 worst patches for child poverty are here too.Even the popularity of Tommyfield – an Aladdin’s cave built just 30 years ago and serving everything from fresh meat and veg to haircuts – is to some extent evidence of a population without disposable income. “People come here because they need good value just to get by,” says Robinson, who has run his business in the town for 19 years.Now, the concern is that a second lockdown could decimate the still struggling economy here.Robinson, himself, had to throw away £2,000 worth of stock during the national closure from March to June, while the council here - much to the astonishment of many – continued to charge traders full rent. “If there has to be another lockdown to save lives, so be it,” the 54-year-old, who employs four staff at the unit, says. “No-one’s going to argue with that. But don’t think it won’t hurt. It would be devastating.”Pertinently, perhaps, if the dilemma is Oldham’s right now, it appears increasingly unlikely it will be the only place to find itself wrestling with the same predicament. With new infections across the country topping 1,000 for a second day running on Wednesday – the first time that’s happened since June – it is almost certain more towns will face such tough measures.“It was crippling first time round and would be worse second,” says Ray Aslam, in between serving sweets and lollies at his Kandy Kingdom shop. “I know for a fact a lot of businesses here managed to get by because of the £10,000 grant from the government. But if there’s a local lockdown without that support, there would be closures all over town.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Council and support services already under strain become further stretched, while young people leave in search of work elsewhere. It is a vicious circle that could last decades, reckons Aslam.“Oldham has been here before so we know how it goes,” he says before turning to a customer brightly. “Pear drops, love?”There is another concern beyond the economy here too: that a new lockdown may lead to inter-community tensions.Already it appears some residents are blaming spiralling infection rate on certain communities. Specifically, they are blaming the town’s 20 per cent Muslim population.This, to be clear, is against the evidence. The spread, says Arooj Shah, the council’s cabinet member for Covid-19 recovery, is “in all areas, in all age groups, and in all communities”.Nonetheless, there are concerns that, in a town where race riots exploded in 2001, such disinformation could lead to a rise in Islamophobia. “It is unfortunate that this is happening,” a spokesperson for the Oldham Muslim Centre said. “Members of the Muslim community have made – and continue to make – large sacrifices to stick to the guidelines and to play their part in bringing the spread under control.”This, certainly, is supported by Katrina Stephens, Oldham’s director of public health, who says infections are occurring right across the board.It was she who took the decision to warn residents that if restrictions already in place in the borough – mainly, different households not mixing – were not followed more rigorously, stricter measures may be imposed.She did so after becoming alarmed that the infection rate had almost doubled in the last week. It now stands at 107.5 per 100,000 population. For context, when Leicester was kept in local lockdown in July – as the rest of the country was released from restrictions – the rate there was 135 per 100,000 people.Covid-19 is airborne and social distancing ‘not helpful’, study saysCoronavirus cluster linked to Glasgow high schoolSecond consecutive day over 1,000 new cases for first time since JuneRecord 30 million people sought help from NHS 111 during pandemicIt is not solely the number of infections which will be considered over the next couple of days as officials wrestle with the dilemma. It will also be proportions of positive tests and hospital admissions. Counter-intuitively, perhaps, part of the problem in Oldham has been that there has been specific major outbreak. Officials cannot pin a spread down to a certain business, bar or neighbourhood. It appears to be circulating everywhere.“Which makes it difficult to tackle with more targeted measures,” Stephens said.Reasonable enough but would a decision on a total lockdown take into account the sheer economic hardship people feared they would face? It would.Would there be help from either central government or the council for those facing such hardships? A more ambiguous answer. “There are a range of discussions being had,” she said.That probably isn’t the definitive answer that may have reassured many here.But outside Smoke Yard – a burger and cocktail joint close to the recently refurbished town hall – manager Dave Turner felt the moral case for help was incontestable.His restaurant had turned to deliveries during the national shut down and had managed to generate about 40 per cent of usual business. All the same, it had lost three staff and he wasn’t sure another prolonged period of closure could be survived.“As I understand local lockdowns,” he said, “you shut one area so the virus doesn’t spread to other parts of the country. So Oldham would be bearing the brunt to protect others. Surely, if we’re making that sacrifice, it’s only fair that we get some help in return.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was obvious this was going to be difficult but it’s been weeks or months in the coming,” he said, noting the fallout last week in Scotland where grades were downgraded for students from more deprived areas.Education secretary Gavin Williamson has insisted the system is fair and “robust”.Labour condemns downgrading of A-level results as ‘huge injustice’Keir Starmer calls on government to rethink A-level results systemStudents prepared to protest A-level results ‘if it doesn’t go well’Thousands of A-level results downgradedStudent accuses exam boards of ‘playing around with people\u0027s futures’ after receiving downgraded resultsEllie French, an A-level student from Basildon, has expressed her anger and confusion after receiving downgraded results today and being rejected from her chosen university course.Ellie, 18, was hoping to study history at Nottingham. Despite expecting an A in history, she received a C grade, meaning although she received A grades in English and politics, she was turned down and will now go through clearing.She told PA that in her previous mocks, she “never got lower than a B” for the subject.“My school sent me my results and they also put the teacher assessed and final mock grade on it as well as our final grade, and for me history read: Final mock grade: A, teacher assessment: A, final grade: C.”The student from Appleton School in Benfleet intends to appeal the grade and has no idea why she had been given a C.“It seems like they just randomly pick and choose who can go up and who can go down in the grade, it doesn’t really make sense.“I’m just really annoyed and confused. If I did the exam I would have got the grades I was meant to get. It just feels so stupid. I feel like they don’t really know what they’re doing.“They’ve really messed it up. I blame the exam boards and I think they’re just playing around with people’s futures.”‘Heartbreaking’ results as school leaders concerned about ‘detrimental impact’ on studentsThe Association of School and College (ASCL) leaders has said in a statement that there has been a “great deal of volatility among the results” being received by students today.Geoff Barton, general secretary of ASCL, raised concerns that the statistical model used to determine students’ grades this year has lowered them and “created clear injustices”.He said: “While there has been an overall increase in top grades, we are very concerned that this disguises a great deal of volatility among the results at school and student level.“We have received heartbreaking feedback from school leaders about grades being pulled down in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable. They are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on their students.“They worked very hard to provide accurate grades to the exam boards, carefully following all the guidance, and are dismayed that the statistical model then used to standardise these grades has had such a devastating impact. This is in terms of both the number of grades lowered, and some students’ results being pulled down by more than one grade.“We will be working to understand more about what has happened, but our immediate impression is that the statistical process has proved to be far too blunt an instrument and has created clear injustices.The organisation called for the government and OFQUAL to review the situation and warned them against insisting all is well.“It is not sufficient for the government to dismiss these concerns by saying that schools and colleges can attempt to battle their way through the appeals process, or that students who are not satisfied can enter the autumn exam series some seven to eight months after they finished their courses, and are no longer at the centre where they studied, added Mr Barton.“We have done everything we possibly can to support the grading process in difficult circumstances, but there is a time to say enough is enough.”More students accepted on to UK degree courses this year - UcasUcas figures have shown that more students have been accepted on to UK degree courses this year.In total, 358,860 people from across the UK have had places confirmed, up 2.9 per cent on the same point last year.Data published by the university admissions service revealed\u0026nbsp 34,310 international students from outside the EU have been accepted (up 2 per cent), while acceptances from students within the EU have fallen by 15.2 per cent to 22,430.Reporting by PAEducation secretary congratulates students receiving A-level results todayGavin Williamson has congratulated students receiving their results today and praised them for their achievements “in the most extraordinary and difficult circumstances.He said in a statement: “Grades awarded today will open up the doors of opportunity for young people to progress to the next stage of their lives, whether studying at one of our world class universities, taking up an apprenticeship or embarking on the start of their careers.“Any students who feel they have grounds for appeal\u0026nbspnow have the safety net of being able to use their mock results as evidence, as well as the chance of sitting autumn exams, thanks to our triple lock process to ensure confidence and fairness in the system.“The resilience they have shown during these challenging times\u0026nbspwill serve them well and I wish them all the very best for the future.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants.

The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

It’s our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens.”Thanks to social distancing and hygiene measures, St Paul’s Church of England Primary School in Swanley, Kent, fully reopened in June.Here, its head teacher blasts the unions for failing children with their “can’t do” attitude. AS a country, we are trying to get back to some sort of normality — and schools have a big part to play in that.Getting children back into the classroom is vital so parents can get back to work.Yet this is proving anything but child’s play.Unions have hit schools with a checklist of  demands before opening next month. This exhaustive list includes assurances that schools will take specic measures to stop children drinking hand sanitiser, extra support for the wellbeing of staff suffering from workload worries, anxiety or the effects of trauma and insisting classes be held “one week on, one week off”.Union members have been urged to present this checklist to headteachers and to expect its completion.It is not helpful. Unions should be working with schools to ensure there is a safe , not creating ision — which is what this will do. If we keep looking at checklists of things that need to be ticked off, we will never get schools reopened.It will never be perfect for everyone. Nothing is. There are always dfering opinions.When askedthe checklist raised the bar too high, NEU president Amanda Martin responded: “This is people’s safety. What cost is safety ”Of course safety is important. But unions should be pulling together and supporting schools, rather than making it very dficult for them to come back.Before my school reopened, I was stunned to hear some unions were encouraging teachers not to engage in conversation with head-teachers. How is that helpful to anyone We have a responsibility to children to be back. If we don’t come back now, when We can’t keep putting it off. We must come back at some point and September is as good a time as any.It is about common sense and making sure the school community is as safe as it can be. Get the basics done from the off and tweak it as we go. That is how it should work.And I know — because I made it work.When we reopened our school in June we followed the guidance the Government set out to the letter.We didn’t have any cases of staff or students falling ill with the virus.We installed a marquee in our playing field to create extra space, as well as supplying portaloos and mobile handwashing facilities to keep pupils and staff safe.Classes were kept apart with inidual entrances and exits. Yes, we are a smaller school with fewer children.But I have fewer staff and less space to play with.As a community, the school came together, did the right thing and got the children back. That’s what it is about: Working with your community — the pupils, parents and staff.Inevitably, there was going to be some sort of drop in pupils’ learning. But children are really resilient. We saw that when they came back.They were straight back into six-hour days, with a full timetable of learning.They dealt with it really well. Actually, they loved coming back to the stability and routine of what they knew.As much as you try to put in a timetable at home, you don’t follow it because the environment is very dferent.I have two children myself and know how hard it was during that time . . . and I’m a teacher.My we and I were both working full-time from home. To get my six-year-old to do more than an hour’s work was incredibly dficult.You don’t get the same experience sitting in front of a screen watching a teacher online as you do being in a classroom interacting with other people.I strongly feel schools have a responsibility to give parents the opportunity to get back into some sort of normality with work.Because we brought all our children back, parents were able to work better from home and do the things they needed to do.We had a number of parents who were made redundant during lockdown.With not having the children at home, they had the chance to look for other work. Meanwhile, their kids were safe.Just this week, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the “very low” risk to children from Covid- meant the reopening of schools is safe.Research carried out in  institutions across the UK will confirm “there is very little evidence” of coronavirus transmission where pupils have ed.I hope this will help reassure parents, as the negative impact of keeping children away from classrooms runs deeper than their education.The effect on the mental health of our nation’s youngsters could be catastrophic. The social impact of schools is vital.We were back for a month before the summer holidays and that was one of the overriding factors parents talked about. Lots of children were sad, very quiet and not their normal selves during lockdown.But coming back to school really changed them. That was evident from day one.Parents had been concerned about their children’s mental health and could see how happy they were to be back at school, where they were able to interact with their friends and peers and reignite those friendships.It was wonderful to hear children laughing and enjoy- ing each other’s company.That is something you can’t get in lockdown — the social aspect of school le.Schools are at the heart of most communities.Andschools can get back safely, the rest of the community will hopefully follow back into some normality.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which depicts a happy family - was actually a nightmare to plan because his sons blew hot and cold with their dad.Yesterday it was claimed Princess Eugenie was left upset after Meghan Markle and Prince Harry broke the news they were expecting a baby at her wedding.Meghan and Harry told friends and family that the duchess was pregnant at Eugenies big day at St Georges chapel at Windsor in October .The books authors wrote in the biography: A source said [Princess Eugenie] told friends she felt the couple should have waited to share the news.It comes as the biography claimed that Harry felt like he and Meghan had been thrown under a bus to protect members of the Royal Family.It was claimed the -year-old got upset as his reported feud with brother Prince William was played out publicly.A source told authors Omid Scobie and Caroline Durand: Harry was upset that it was playing out so publicly and that so much of the information being reported was wrong.There had been moments where he felt people working with his brother had put things out there to make William look good, evenit meant throwing Harry under the bus.It was a confusing time, and his head was all over the place—he didnt know who or what to believe, and he and William werent talking enough either, which made everything a lot worse. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in amongst the gloom there are some glimmers of growth.“Now is the time for everyone to rally round and really fire up the economy together.“Whether it’s going back to school or work in the office again, going to your local restaurant or pub for a meal or visiting your local shops for a bit of retail therapy,we all play our part we can relight our economic firepower together.“I know that businesses around the country have taken extraordinary steps to make sure everyone can do so confidently and safely.”The Tory big gun added: “This country has faced adversity before and come out stronger and I believe this time will be no dferent.”Mr Sunak said people should “safely” head back to work, shops and restaurants.He added: “As people get back to going shopping or going out for a meal or indeed getting back to their office they will see that it’s a new normal . . . a safe normal.“We have made changes, guidance is there to ensure that safety, and they shouldn’t be too nervous about the virus.”The Chancellor said the economy was better protected by “a new safer environment”.And he stressed: “We want to try and protect as many jobs as possible. That comes from as much of our economy ing to normal as possible.”Top economists welcomed the growth in June, which is likely to have continued in July and August.Julian Jessop, from the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: “The real news is not that the UK fell into recession in the second quarter of the year. That much we knew.“Instead, it is that the recovery that began in May accelerated in June as lockdown began to be lted.“Of course, there is still a long way to go before these green shootsthe economy to where it was before the pandemic struck. But mighty oaks grow from little acorns.” He added: “People now need to be encouraged to come off furlough and get back to work as soon as possible — whether this is for their existing employer or for another business that is better able to cope with the ‘new normal’, whatever that may prove to be.”Jonathan Athow, of the Office for National Statistics, said: “The economy began to bounce back in June, with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and house-building continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.”Labour’s shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused the Government of mishandling the crisis as figures suggested the largest crash in Europe and the G group of nations.She said: “We’ve already got the worst excess death rate in Europe — now we’re on course for the worst recession too.”But last month she admitted the UK had a “service heavy” economy and was likely to be hit harder from lockdown than other nations.A government source accused the Labour chiefs of “playing politics”.British families are each £, worse off after the Covid- lockdown, new figures show.The Resolution Foundation, the think tank that focuses on living standards, calculated the wealth hit per family so far. Today, official figures confirmed that the economy shrank by an unprecedented . per cent in the second quarter.This was as measured by gross domestic productor output.GDP is often used to represent a country’s wealth.Not only is the UK formally in recession. It’s in the deepest recession in UK history, the deepest of any G economy, and the deepest since the invention of Gross Domestic Product. There’s a glimmer of hope buried in the grim data, though. In June, when the Government began to loosen lockdown restrictions, the economy grew an astonishing . per cent. That’s the biggest month-on-month jump since records began. It’s clear that we DO stand a chance of a relatively swt economic recovery - but onlyBrits start going about their pre-Covid lives sooner rather than later. And with hospital cases down  per cent since the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, the NHS is in no danger of being overwhelmed. Of course Covid isn’t over and we can’t be complacent. But Government scientists are attracted to long-term lockdowns because they’re trained to think about public health in the narrowest possible terms. The rest of us, though, understand that in the long run, mass poverty and unemployment kills just as surely as any disease.It’s time to get Britain working.The massive hit to output in the three months to June was £billion — or roughly £, per family.The Federation of Small Businesses is calling for a cut to NI contributions, a revamp of business rates and the “most pro-business Budget ever” in the autumn.The Institute of Economic Affairs believes the key to a strong recovery will be the continued lting of the lockdown — particularly the reopening of schools.  GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It looks good on the CV.I say “results” — of course, they are not results, as such. Instead, teachers have been tasked with deciding how well each student might have donerequired to sit an exam. These predictions are then weighted by the exam boards.As you might expect, teachers tend to overrate the abilities of their students. Not least because it makes THEM look good. In Scotland, they were over-generous to the tune of  per cent — and even more so in some “deprived” areas.The Scottish schoolkids were pretty hacked off to find their grades reduced by the boards, and moaned about it. So the Scottish government caved in and let them have their original grades. The ones that were overvalued.And so when little Jimmy proudly displays his long list of As and Bs to prospective employers — or, God help us, a university — people will just snigger.They know he can’t spell his own name or, like the rabbits in Watership Down, count past five. Nobody will take the results seriously after the Scottish government did its cowardly U-turn.Sadly for the youngsters, they will be pretty meaningless results. Which is a horrible thing to say after they’ve been studying for so long.South of the border we’re doing things a little better. Kids will be able to take the grade awarded to them. Or they can choose to use the result they got in their mocks — exams taken before Mr Covid arrived on the scene. Or they can take a special written exam in the autumn.That’s more sensible. But I suspect, even so, that employers and the universities will be a little wary of taking the results at face value. They will have their doubts.All of this has happened because we’re trying to be kind to the kids. And the reason we’re being kind is because these past six months we have let them down badly. The Government has let them down — and even more so, the teachers.Too many schools had no virtual classrooms at all during lockdown. The kids might have been sent a few worksheets. But time with their teachers was non-existent, even via Zoom.Too many teachers have been absolutely bone idle. Two-thirds of children have taken part in no virtual lessons whatsoever. Schools refused to make them — so the kids skived. And that’s in schools where there WERE regular virtual lessons.My own child, a girl of , completed five physics papers during lockdown. And being my daughter, sent them to the wrong email address. Nobody checked, nobody cared.The truth is our kids have had six months of doing nowt. Being nice to them now because we ignored their needs through spring and summer is all well and good. But it does not excuse the disgraceful behaviour of the teaching unions. Nor the failure of the Government to stand up to the unions.The result of all this will be a bigger ide than ever between poorer and richer kids. The middle classes are flocking to the private sector — where schools WILL be open and there’s always a full timetable of virtual work.For the rest — just the suspicion that they have been treated very badly indeed. By the people whose responsibility it was to look after them.It’s time Labour came clean about our teachers. Do they want the schools to reopen or not  And no more weasel words about keeping everybody safe. You cannot eliminate risk entirely, as Sir Keir Starmer well knows.We are now in a recession. Nothing will drag us out of it more quickly than the schools reopening, full-time, no s nor buts. Then the rest of us can get back to work.THE former boss of McDonald’s is in trouble for having exchanged nude pics with fellow workers.Brit Steve Easterbrook, pictured with Alesha Dixon at the London  Olympics, is also in trouble for having slept with a few colleagues.Now, those pics.I don’t knowSteve has a Whopper, a Quarter Pounder, a Big n’ Tasty – or just a chicken nugget.

And Steve was a orcee. What seems to me wrong is McDonald’s banning all of its staff from having relationships in-house.I WONDER how Prince Andrew has been coping during this heatwave If you remember, he explained to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis that he has an inability to sweat. Just can’t do it. He must be bursting, underneath his skin. Perhaps he will explode.Me, I’m sick of sweating.

The noncey scout leader look – it’s all the rage.The BBC was worrying about this hot spell. Wonderedit was the result of global warming.Isn’t it something to do with that thing called “summer” I seem to remember it kind of happening before, you know I’m talking about the people who, in the middle of a global pandemic, travel abroad for their holidays. And are then surprised there are problems on account of the fact that we are in the middle of a global pandemic.Truth is, I have about as much sympathy as I do for people who travel to appalling war-torn countries for their hols then whine at the British Government to get them out.Would it hurt THAT much just to stay in the UK this summer WEDNESDAY was a pretty bad day for grouse.They have it circled in their diaries each year, in red. The “Glorious Twelfth”. This is when City boys and braying toffs take to the grouse moors and start blasting away at anything that moves. Especially grouse. Slow, heavy birds. Not very bright. Hard to miss them from eight yards with a -bore, evenyou’re a halfwit.It’s a bad day for the rest of us, too. And for our countryside. Grouse moors take up an astonishing eight per cent of our land. And yet they are kept solely for the grouse and the , or so numpties who try to shoot them every year.As a result, these moorlands are almost entirely devoid of wildle. Just barren deserts full of heather and nothing .And the gamekeepers burn the heather every spring – just when any songbirds might be nesting.

There are very few things better than fresh fish and really good chips by the seaside. When it’s done right it absolutely sings.”For the Ready Steady Cook favourite the emphasis should be on “texture and flavour”.He adds that the best examples have: “Sweet, rich fish coated in thin, crispy batter. Chips not too crispy and not too soft.And all of it heavily seasoned with salt and vinegar and a squeeze of lemon. I like mushy peas and tartare sauce, not ketchup.”Nick says location is also an important factor.He adds: “I’d be sitting on a big beach with a grandstand view of the ocean and Mrs Nairn by my side, eating one of the finest meals in Britain. Fish and chips by the seaside, what’s not to love.”With quarantines making international holidays less appealing, Judy Cogan asks Nick to cast his eye over some of the best seaside chippies . . .WHAT a plaice! This has been family run for  years and locals and tourists still queue down the street on Saturday nights for its fresh, battered fish and chips fried in beef dripping.Nick says: “Frying chips in beef dripping is actually quite healthy. They absorb slightly less fat and natural is always better than processed.“The best chips are cooked in beef fat.”ENJOY traditional cod or line-caught haddock looking out over Lyme Bay.The speciality dish is the Cod Royale , a fillet of cod topped with smoked salmon and cooked in batter.Nick says: “The rich flavour of smoked salmon together with cod in batter sounds like a winning combination.“It’s very innovative, I don’t think I have ever heard of that before.”OWNERS the Smiths trace their roots in the fishing industry back to the s and specialise in Scottish haddock in a “secret recipe” batter.Fish is caught daily and filleted on site. They serve a slice of bread from a local award-winning bakery with every order.Nick says: “It’s one of the most popular spots in Fe and I’ve been many times. Fe is a great area for potatoes.”THIS tiny seafront takeaway serves fresh fish filleted on site and chips hand cut from Maris Pipers.A veggie section offers cheese and broccoli nuggets. Nick says: “For me, small is beautul when it comes to chippies and a shack on the beach is Instagram gold these days.“I like that it caters for vegetarians because most don’t. What’s not to love ”ON the beach and a stone’s throw from Margate’s Dreamland and the Turner Contemporary gallery, you can work up an appetite before finishing your day with a box of fresh haddock cooked in crisp batter and thick chips for £..Nick says: “Wow, that’s a bit of value there.“The idea of soaking up a bit of culture then enjoying fish and chips really tickles my fancy.”THIS chippie near Aberdeen is Nick’s favourite.He says: “It is run by the amazing Callum Richardson and was named the UK’s No fish and chip shop .“It’s right on the coast so sea-to-plate stuff and I love eating here while watching the waves crashing in.“On one memorable occasion the waves crashed right over our car. Luckily we had the windows closed.”TOUTED locally as the best chippie in town, it is known for its friendly service and gluten-free batter. Chips are currently made from seasonal new potatoes.Nick says: “New potatoes are new to me. It’s good to see seasonal interests at the heart of a business.“Blackpool is an iconic seaside town so fish and chips on the promenade sounds great to me.”NOT far from Tenby’s North Beach, this traditional chippie takes pride in its gluten-free batter, made on site from ground rice and potato and fried in its own special fryer.It only uses local ingredients. Nick says: “One thing I would look for in a really good fish and chip shop is locally sourced fish.“And I like that it separates its gluten free fryer from the main fryer.”THIS shop constantly refines its menu, cooking techniques and ingredients to ensure top-notch fish, mainly cod and haddock.It won the Good Catch Sustainable Seafood Award in . Nick says: “That’s a high award in the fish and chip world.Haddock is very sustainable and, for me, it’s one of the best fish on the planet, but it’s got to be spanking fresh.”EXPECT hearty portions of sustainable fish at this warm cafe inside an old, traditional fisherman’s hut on the beach.Nick says: “This sounds idyllic. A fisherman’s hut on the beach where you can watch the boats that caught your fish. That’s hard to beat.“And it’s licensed, so you can enjoy a glass of wine with your fish and chips while looking out to sea. What could be finer ”CELEBRITY chef Rick Stein once said this seafront cafe, “opened my eyes to how good a fish shop could be”.It has been operating since  and attracts long queues thanks to its secret recipe batter and tartare sauce.

Some species breach out of the water, but not typically this kind - they usually hang out in the water column or look for food on the bottom of the seafloor.She was a bundle of energy and could sense I wanted to get a perfect split shot selfie.Usually stingrays are bottom dwellers, meaning they find food along the sandy bottom of the seafloor, so it was awesome to see her launch out of the water. You don’t see that behavior often.Cassie, who is an Underwater Photographer, Expedition Leader and Equestrian Show Jumping Groom said stingrays in the area are friendly with humans due to them often being fed small tidbits.According to Cassie, the wild stingrays are used to humans and come swimming over - pushing themselves up out of the water in search for food - as soon as they hear a boat pull upAlthough not all stingrays are quite as friendly, with one killing Australian zookeeper and wildle expert, Steve Irwin, in .Cassie added: All wild and domesticated animals can be dangerous. Stingrays have a defense mechanism in their barbed tail, but they usually only use it when they are under extreme stress, orthey feel they are being threatened.Of course we need to respect wildle and all animals at all times, as anything can happen at any time.It is important to constantly be aware of these risks, your behaviour in the water, aware of the animals’ behaviour, and other external and internal factors that can cause stress to the animals we interact with.I always say we need to remember to always “expect the unexpected” - after all, the ocean is their home, not ours. We are just visitors.A split shot is the hardest image to master, so I honestly just got lucky with it, perfect timing and the perfect waterline, and focus - it takes a lot of practice to get images like that but it also takes a little luckAfter she came up out of the water like that, I wasn’t sureI nailed it. Split shots are so dficult to capture correctly and there are a lot of factors that have to work to make it happen.After she plopped back into the water, I gave her a small piece of dead fish to thank her for posing with me and checked the LCD of my camera.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The last improvised explosive device that he found resulted in catastrophic injuries, which included the loss of both of his legs.Fellow campaigner, Congresswoman Dina Titus , added: “The VA’s invasive and deadly cat experiments are sickening. You don’t have to be a cat owner like I am to recognise that.I’ll continue to work to end these similarly abusive tests on cats and redirect VA resources to humane research tools that will help improve veterans’ lives.”The Sun has contacted the VA for a comment on the lawmakers and Army veterans campaign launch.The Veterans Department says it has been granted approval to use felines to help Americans with debilitating illnesses.For example bladder-based research was needed as, more than  million Americans face the challenges of incontinence, frequent urination, or dysal voiding, where people struggle to pass stools.This is often related to spinal cord injury, diabetes, or ageing, which are common in the veteran population, says the VA.It aims to find better ways to diagnose and treat the causes of these problems by using devices that can monitor bladder volume and pressure under everyday conditions and in people without sensation. Cats control their bladders in ways similar to how people do, and are large enough for devices developed with them to be scalable for human use.But, the VA has been slammed by the White Coat Waste Projects as taxpayers are being forced to pay over ,-millionper year for this waste and abuse.Using the FOIA, we have obtained never-before-seen videos, photos and other documents detailing constipation experiments in a US govt lab.Cats are given spinal cord injuries, implanted with experimental devices, and then fake faeces are forced into their rectums. At the end, the cats are killed, the group says.Justin Goodman, vice president of advocacy and public policy at the taxpayer watchdog group, told The Sun: Taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to pay millions for VA bureaucrats to buy healthy cats, cripple and mutilate them, and videotape their abuse in wasteful, bizarre and deadly constipation experiments.Analysis of medical records obtained via the FOIA show the experiments and procedures cause the cats distress, seizures, bloody urine, and depression, the group found.Its accused the VA of torturing cats as young as six months old in cruel and wasteful constipation and incontinence experiments.Instead of using animals, the tests could be done in human volunteers which would give results directly related to people, WCW urged.From initial information released so far, two of the experiments show approval to use and kill  cats, the campaigners added.Purchase receipts provided by the VA shows its researchers typically buy cats for these experiments in August and September each year.All of these tests are classied as painful experiments.Since January , the VAs constipation tests have cost taxpayers about ,a year.

In December  US Congress enacted WCW-backed legislation directing the VA to phase out testing on cats, dogs and monkeys by .The same month, WCW used the federal FOIA to request documents related to VA cat testing, including photos, videos, invoices for cat purchases, cats’ medical records, and approved applications for experiments.The VA is still in the process of responding but has released initial information as per the request.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The aim of the app is to ensure people who have been in contact with a case of coronavirus, but do not know them, to be able to be tracked down and isolated in case they develop symptoms. It will log the time and distance a user has spent near to anyone, eventhey dont know them, so it can alert themnecessarythat person later tests positive for Covid-.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had pledged the ground-breaking and world-beating app would be ready by mid-May.Officials have blamed delays on the launch of the app on its ability to measure exact distances between phones. But they are now confident those glitches have been ironed out. The software works by using Bluetooth to log when another user’s smartphone has been in close proximity.A confirmed case can report their status to the app, which automatically sends out an anonymous alert to other users they may have infected urging them to self-isolate and get a free test – thus stopping further spread.Test and Trace head Baroness Dido Harding has described the app as the cherry on the cake and refused to give a date for the release of the app.But people working on the project said it is still expected to be released this year, according to Sky news. NHS England is hoping to add personal benefits to the app to help encourage people to download it.

I needed three As to get into the University of Leeds.That was my three predicted grades from my teachers. So Im a bit disappointed.I think I could have got my three AsI did my exams which Im sad about.I think I deserved three As, so its annoying. Im just hoping Leeds will let me in with these grades. Hear principal Mr Britain said: Its completely unfair when students like Megan when an algorithm, some sort of standardisation process has meant she hasnt got the grades that she should have got.Yes, hopefully youll still get into the university, but its still not right that these young people havent got the correct grades.Students were left in tears after being disappointed with their results - with some even burning their letters.Abby, from Hull, admitted to breaking down after seeing her results after receiving D, D, E grades in her A-level subjects – meaning she missed both her firm and insurance university places.She told the BBC: “My future has been set back completely. I might have to wait one or two years now to go to university.“There’s been loads of people crying, not getting the results they wanted, and it’s down to something that wasn’t our choice.Abbie Cooper, an AS-level student from Cwmbran, said she was distraught after receiving two Ds and a U.The -year-old said: Last year I couldnt attend college a lot due to anxiety and mental health issues but any time I did a mock or a piece of work Id still get a D, a C or a B. The Ds that I did get had been improved to a B and a C at the end of the year, and my predicted at the end of the year was a B-B-B.I thought Id pretty much secured at least a C, but I checked my results this morning and it said U-D-D.Abbie, who attends Colleg Gwent, received D grades in politics and psychology and a U in biology and is now worried about what the results will mean for her university prospects.It kind of feels like they just got a number generator or a letter generator and given you a grade based on that, she said.It sucks because I need these to apply for university next year because these are my predicteds for university. How can I go anywhere with these In a snap poll run by The Student Room this morning, already close to % of students have already responded saying that their A-Level grades were worse than expected. One student commented “I honestly have a rock in my stomach, I wanna get blackout drunk and just cry right now. I got predicted a ABC and just received CCE, I got all s and s during GCSEs and didnt do well during mocks but at worst expected BCD or something like that.

My son was predicted straight As but received a B and  x Cs. Disappointed doesn’t even cover it, I’m glad he’s going to appeal.I feel for the others that have been marked down today.Yet another added: Please can someone explain to me how my god-daughter, who was predicted A, B, C, can be given B, D, U for her A-level results.

Her mock results were AAA, her centre assessed results were A*,A,A* which she % deserves yet because of clever Boris’ algorithm she’s ended up with BBC ... HOW do you come to that result when NONE of her work has ever been graded that.Kids cant launch an appeal, but the schools can do it for them. And they can use their mocks to help decide on a grade after a last-minute change of plan.However, exams regulator Ofqual havent yet set out the details of how to submit these appeals - and what mocks will be valid to use.Students can also choose to sit the exam in the autumn too, and pick the best mark they have available.

They are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on their students.This is in terms of both the number of grades lowered, and some students’ results being pulled down by more than one grade.He said the way kids get their grades has created clear injustices.Teachers are calling on the Government to review the system as a matter of urgency but Mr Williamson has insisted there will be no more changes.Mr Barton added: “We have done everything we possibly can to support the grading process in dficult circumstances, but there is a time to say enough is enough.”Michelle Meadows from Ofqual admitted that poorer kids did have their grades pulled down more than richer ones.She said earlier today: “We have done a great deal of analysis of the final calculated grades to ensure there is no evidence of bias.“We have also looked at centre assessment grades. You will be able to see an analysis according to socio economic status.“The research literature shows of A-level predictions for university entrance is that there is a tendency to be more generous for students of lower socio economic status.“So there will be a tendency for there to be more generosity.“The important thing is to look at the analysis for the end grades students take away – you can see there is no evidence of systematic bias.”According to UCAS, a total of , people, from the UK and overseas, have had university places confirmed - an increase of .%.Ministers have urged universities to be flexible and take into account a range of evidence when choosing which youngsters to admit to their degree courses on Thursday in the wake of coronavirus. Clare Marchant, the Chief Executive of UCAS, said that this will be a “big year for clearing” following the last-minute change to the appeals process.At least , students are expected to go into Clearing, in comparison to last year’s ,, according to Marchant.Phones have been “ringing off the hook” in the call centre at Bristol University this morning - as thousands of students attempt to secure places amid A-level grading confusion.Here are the rates for students receiving the top grades :Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Public trials will begin on the Isle of Wight, three months after Matt Hancock claimed an app for the NHS Test and Trace programme would be ready. The island is the same place the first app was trialled in early May. But that app was ditched in June because it only picked up contacts with iPhones % of the time.

The new app will ask users to scan QR codes to check in at pubs, cafes and restaurants to provide a aposvirtual diaryapos of their recent movements.

The app will include alerts based on postcode, QR check-in at venues, a symptom checker and a way to book tests, using Google and Apple-developed technology. Trials start from today on the Isle of Wight and with NHS volunteer responders across England, followed shortly by Newham residents. This is dferent from the original app which was designed around using bluetooth connections to monitor when people came close to each other. However, the new app will also use Bluetooth technology. It will log the time and distance a user has spent near to anyone, eventhey donapost know them, so it can alert themnecessarythat person later tests positive for Covid-. It comes amid turmoil over the NHS Test and Trace programme after , out of , privately-employed contact tracers were ditched. NHS Test and Trace is meant to reach Covid sufferersapos close contacts to tell them to isolate for  days. How do you think the Government should be dealing with tracing and testing  Have your say in the comments below.But the national programme is failing to reach more than a quarter of them - amid claims the work is so quiet, some contact tracers are paid to watch Netflix . More of the work will now be carried out by local public health teams who can go door to door. Yet despite outsourcing giants Serco and Sitel being scaled back, the firms are to have their contracts extended when the changes happen on August . Serco was allocated £m and Sitel £m of taxpayer cash for the opening months of the programme. And campaign group We Own It says £m has been allocated for extensions for the two firms. The exact value of the extension is yet to be confirmed. The app is intended to support the NHS Test and Trace effort by keeping a log of others who come into close contact but the plans have been marred by constant delays and privacy concerns.  The Government has since moved on to technology designed by Apple and Google - already used in several countries across the world - which handles data in a more privacy-friendly manner and does not suffer the same type of accuracy error. However, this method is said to struggle with a problem of its own, measuring distance between people correctly. According to the BBC, the Isle of Wight will be part of the trial once again, as well as one other area in England and a volunteer group. We need the app to help stop transmission by tracing close-proximity contacts as quickly and as comprehensively as possible, capturing those contacts we donapost know or donapost remember meeting, Professor Christophe Fraser, a scientic adviser to the Department of Health from Oxford University, told the broadcaster.

Thunder storms and torrential rain caused the mobile homes to slide down a hill, sparking a huge emergency service presence. The landslide happened at Pettycur Bay in Fe, Scotland last night. Shocking snaps showed caravans had crashed into one another as they slipped down the slope of the holiday park, Daily Star reports. Glen McGill was one of the hundreds who was evacuated from his holiday home during the incident. He said: “We had hours and hours of the most horrendous lighting and heavy rain from at least pm to am. Were you one of those evacuated  Email webnews@mirror “I’ve never seen anything like it.

Captioning photos that were uploaded in the early hours of the morning, Glen said: “We’ve just been evacuated from our caravan due to danger of landslip. “One along from us is already slipping. No sleep tonight as road out blocked both ways.” He then added: “All caravans now being evacuated at Pettycur. “Main road blocked to either side with landslips though Burntisland side might be passable for emergency vehicles.  “A lot of mud and a few vans where they shouldn’t be. Just hope the ground isn’t any more unstable.” Thankfully, it is understood that no one was injured in the landslide.

Hereaposs some top tips from the experts to keep babies and children cool and safe during the hot weather. Don’t cover the buggy Parents often put a blanket or cover over their babyaposs pram in the hope it will keep their child out of the sun, but a paediatrician has warned it could actually heat up the buggy like a thermos. News outlet Svenska Dagbladet tested the theory and found a buggy without a cover reached C, but when a cover was applied temperatures rocketed to C. Check their bedding The NHS advises keeping nightwear and bedclothes to a minimum for young children. Remove heavy bedding and do not cover your child when itaposs hot. It states: If your baby kicks or pushes off the covers during the night, consider putting them in just a nappy with a single well-secured sheet that will not work loose and cover their face or get entangled during the night.  Put ice in your babyaposs room Freezing bottles of water and placing them in your childaposs room at night can help to cool the air as they melt overnight.Placing them in front of a fan will also help lower the temperature of the air circulating the room, as reported by The Sun.Never leave them in the car Temperatures can soar in cars in an instant so never leave them alone in a vehicle for any amount of time, no matter how quick you plan to be. Also try to limit long drives and use plenty of breaks to cool off. Use flannels to cool them down Soak a flannel in cool water and dab it on your childaposs head and hands to help reduce their temperature. You can also give them a slightly cooler bath before bed to refresh them, but make sure itaposs quick to ensure they donapost get too cold.  Think about their clothes If their bedroom or your home traps heat and itaposs over C indoors, a nappy and a thin vest is probably all you need. When they go out in the sun, make sure their skin is covered when possible, but that the fabric is breathable and light. Use a paddling poolYou should keep small children out of the sun where possible and set up a paddling pool for them to enjoy the fresh air and cool down. Add ice to the wateritaposs becoming too hot, as reported by the Daily Star.Remember to apply sun cream frequentlythey are in the sun and make sure they are covered in waterproof protection when they splash about.

Kusi Kimani, , from East Sussex, was shocked when she discovered a brown bra on the retaileraposs website was called tobacco. The lighter colours of the £ Marks  Spencer Collection padded bras are described as cinnamon and fudge. Ms Kimani complained about the bra for her skin tone carrying negative connotations, while more positive words were used for lighter colours. Yet two months on from her initial complaint, the bra is still being sold in a tobacco colour on the Marks  Spencer website. However, the retailer pledged to drop the name when approached by the Mirror and apologised for not acting sooner. Ms Kimani told : I saw it about two weeks after George Floydaposs death and it was particularly raw to see at that time. Why not call it cocoa, caramel or chocolate - sweet dessert items  But they used tobacco. I was shocked when I saw it. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror Itaposs hurtful to me and my friends. If a young girl who is already uncomfortable with the colour of her skinshe will be feeling even more alienated. Each week that website is showing that racism is another week a young girl may come across it and feel bad for the rest of her le. To see that apostobaccoapos is for their skin tone will make them feel unwanted by society. Tobacco is referred to in society as bad, unhealthy, and highly likely to kill - ‘smoking kills’.  This is an example of how bias is ingrained into society and only helps fuel racism, be it overt or covert, however in this instance this is a form of covert racism. The pharmaceutical clinical trials manager said she just wanted Marks  Spencer to change the name online - and to explain its reasons for the delay. The companyaposs customer service team previously told her that its colour names were not supposed to carry negative connotations.  In an email on June , the retailer said it was reviewing its naming convention and also looking at its product range with BAME staff. The message said: The names we use are taken from those on a colour palette and were never designed to match to a skin tone - I would like to assure you the choice of names is absolutely not intended to carry any negative connotations. We review design trends in the market each year to ensure we are offering a fashionable palette to all our customers, and we are actively reviewing our naming convention in the light of the feedback we are receiving.  We liaise with our store colleagues on a regular basis to determine which colours we need to offer our customer and we are also working with our BAME colleague network to receive their input too. The customer service representative said the company knows it had to have a better, wider skin colour offer, particularly for black and dark skin tones. They added that the range is currently under review so improvements can be made. Ms Kimani told : I approached Marks  Spencer as I thought it could have been an oversight. It shouldnapost be a matter of having to fight to be taken seriously. They are willing to stand with the Black Lives Matter movement but they are not willing to put in the work to make changes.

Journalists Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durandaposs -page book details private parts of the Sussexesapos lives, including the coupleaposs frustrations at le behind palace walls and fallouts within the Firm. The tell-all book is billed as the “truth” behind their decision to quit their royal duties of the start of the year, a move that shocked fans and relatives. Well placed sources have told how Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, paints a “very one sided account” that “will leave lasting scars” on the couple’s relationships with senior royals. They tell the Mirror: “It’s sadly hard to imagine a world where this won’t do lasting damage to many of the personal relationships explored in this very one sided account.” Many questions have also been asked about how much involvement Meghan and Harry had in the book, which is filled with praise about their attempts to find a path in the family. Scobie and Durand claim they did not have interviews with the couple but instead spoke to “more than  sources, with access to the couple’s inner circle..... everything corroborated with at least two sources”.  However in the authorsapos notes on the final pages of the book, they admit they did speak to the couple. They write: We have spoken with close friends of Harry and Meghan, royal aides and palace staff , the charities and organisations they have built long-lasting relationships with and, when appropriate, the couple themselves. In many instances, we have granted sources anonymity to allow freedom to candidly provide direct quotes without their names being attributed .  A palace source said: “One may indeed wonder who those two sources are. “It’s fair to say there is a great deal of skepticism over the involvement of the book’s two primary subjects. Royal watchers have likened the book’s release to Andrew Morton’s sensational  biography of Princess Diana, titled ‘In Her Own Words’. The Princess of Wales was later revealed to have heavily corroborated with the journalist which led to a tit-for-tat airing of grievances in the media between herself and Prince Charles after their orce. Among the most shocking claims in the book is a line which says Harry believed Williamaposs staff were throwing him under the bus.

A new study by Imperial College London saw , volunteers tested for antibodies - and found % had been infected with the virus.This means that . million people could have had coronavirus by July , experts concluded.Londoners, people from ethnic minority groups and care home workers were the most likely to have antibodies, scientists found. The survey was conducted with the use of a simple finger-prick home test said to be easy and accurate enough for mass surveillance studies. According to the Johns Hopkins University in the US - whose aggregated numbers have become the main reference for monitoring the disease - the UKaposs case numbers stood at , this morning. The study tracked the spread of infection across England after the pandemicaposs first peak, with volunteers testing themselves at home between June  and July . People living in London were most likely to have been infected, along with those working in care homes and health care, people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups, and people living in larger households. The programme suggested a total of % of people living in London had Covid- antibodies, compared with less than % in the South West of England.  People working in care homesand health careed far higher results than people who were not key workers, at %. The study found % of black volunteers had antibodies, the categories of Asian and other ethnic minorities had % each. The figure among white volunteers was only %. People aged from  to  showed the highest incidence of antibodies, at %, while over-s had the lowest rate at just %. Volunteers in the most deprived areas of the country were slightly more likely to have antibodies than those in the wealthiest areas, at % compared with %.  Researchers found while those in households of more than six or seven peoplewere more likely to have had Covid- than those in single or two-person households . Smokers were slightly less likely to have antibodies than non-smokers - at % compared with % - while % of people with antibodies had shown no symptoms, a figure which rose to % of those aged older than . Health Minister Edward Argar hailed the study as an important development in Britainaposs fight against the coronavirus.  Large scale antibody surveillance studies are crucial to helping us understand how the virus has spread across the country and whether there are specic groups who are more vulnerable, as we continue our work to drive down the spread of the disease, Mr Argar said in a statement. We donapost yet know that antibodies provide immunity to coronavirus, but the more information we can gather on this virus, and the easier we can make it for people to participate in these studies, the better equipped we will be to respond.

While the logistics will be dferent, the nerves and excitement will be exactly the same as Year s find outtheir hard work has earned them their dream university place. Whether you look back at that day with joy or sorrow, at least we didnapost have to do it with the whole world watching on - which is what members of the Royal Family do. This is the added pressure every royal teen has to deal with on results morning, and even though you would expect the best education money can buy to guarantee decent grades, that isnapost always the case. Princes William and Harry, their wives Kate and Meghan, Charles and Princess Diana have a real iety of A-levels between them. But despite having an aptitude for learning, The Queen didnapost have time for formal schooling and instead spent her youth learning about the constitutional monarchy ropes. In contrast, her children and grandchildren have enjoyed a more normal education - and ying degrees of success to show for it. Hereaposs how they all got on... Prince William William started at the famous Eton College in  and stayed there for most of his education. He picked up his A-level results in  and his results were fairly mixed.  He got an A in geography, a B in art and a C in biology. These grades earned him a place to study History of Art degree at St Andrews University in Scotland, but he later swapped courses and changed to geography. Before heading to uni William took a gap year, spending time in travelling to Chile, Kenya, Tanzania and Botswana.  He packed his bags and moved to St Andrews in , where he met his future we Kate Middleton. He left with a :. Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex wasnapost as academic as his big brother and left school with slightly worse grades. On the royalaposs website it simply says: His Royal Highness went on to Eton College from September  where he took his GCSEs and A Levels. He got a B in Art and D in Geography in his A Levels. However during his time at school Harry excelled in other areas, and was House Captain of Games.  He also represented the school at rugby, cricket and polo, and was a member of the Combined Cadet Force. After finishing in  Harry also took a gap year, travelling to Australia, Africa and Argentina. He decided against university and instead joined the Army, where he embarked on a successful career. The Duchess of Cambridge Kate beat William in their A-Levels, taking home better grades than him on results day. A good student from early on, Kate achieved  GCSEs at St. Andrew’s School in Pangbourne before moving to Marlborough College in Wiltshire.  Her hard work meant she got As in Maths and Art, and a B in English in her A-Levels. Like William, Kate took a gap year before starting university and the pair actually did a very similar trip but their dates didnapost overlap. Kate graduated from St Andrews University in  with a : in History of Art. Meghan Markle As she was educated in America, Meghan didnapost follow the same exam system the rest of the Royals did. Meghan began her secondary education at Immaculate Heart High School in  where she was known as a hard working and focused student. During her high school years, The Duchess of Sussex performed in theatrical productions at both Immaculate Heart and Loyola High School. Her former drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, who directed Meghan in seven plays, remembered that her former student sparkled. She said: You see someone nice to the other kids, who gets good grades, doesnapost say anything bad about anybody. America does not test students using GCSEs or A Levels, and it has not been reported what Meghan got on her SATsbut it is known that she got the grades she needed to get into university. She went on gain a double major in Theatre and International Relations at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in . During her time at university, The Duchess completed an internship at the US Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she learned to speak Spanish. She also studied French for six years. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie Princess Eugenie is probably the smartest royalwhose two As in Art and English Literature and a B in History of Art, beat older sister Beatrice, who received an A in Drama and Bs in History and Film Studies. Beatrice, who got married earlier this year, went on to get a : from Goldsmithaposs in History of Ideas. Eugenie studied English Literature, History of Art and Politics at Newcastle and graduated at the end of her three-year course in  with a :, though there are reports her application was only considered because of her royal status. Prince Charles Prince Charles had a very dficult education to his sons, and was sent to the very strict Gordonstoun. He left with five O-levelsand two A-levels - a B in History and a C in French.  He then went on to Cambridge University where he achieved a : degree in History. Legend has it his bodyguard who was present at all lectures with the young prince sat the exams too - and got a First. Princess Diana Princess Diana didnapost do quite as well at school and failed all her O-levels, twice. However she apparently excelled in deportment, having attended finishing school in Switzerland. The Queen Sheaposs met politicians and film stars, speaks French fluently, loves to colour block and still rides a horse at  years of age, but the Queen has never sat an academic exam in her le meaning she hasnapost a single GCSE or A Levelto her name. In her early childhood, the Queen was taught by a governess from .am until am. Following the abdication of her uncle Edward VIII in , Elizabeth needed to prepare herself for her future role and received lessons on constitutional history from the vice provost of Eton, Henry Marten. The Queen’s father had disliked school and her mother thought it was more important to have fun,’ Professor Kate Williams, author of Young Elizabeth told Good Housekeeping. Unlike her father, the Queen was and is very bright and had an appetite for learning as well as a razor sharp memory. The lack of a formal education didnapost harm her as sheaposs naturally analytical and something of an autodidact, as well as being hard working - which we know now is just as important as raw brainpower. Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, attended Benenden school in Kent where she gained six O-levels, and three A-levels in English, History and Politics.

Not being allowed to see loved ones meant memories had to be made via video call, with birthdays, weddings, proposals and other le-changing moments happening vitrually. While there have obviously been some concerns about the additional screen time, there have been countless benefits to spending more time on our smart phones, tablets and laptops - especially for people with families.As the governmentaposs restrictions ease and the UK slowly begins to reopen, the Very Big Family Le Survey - conducted by Very and the Daily Mirror - has looked back at how weaposve found the past four months.Itaposs also looked ahead to find how people are feeling about the “new normal”. Technology is a big talking point, with most people saying it has helped them get through the tough and unprecedented time. Interestingly, the exclusive Daily Mirror and Very survey showed that more than half of parents say they tried video calls for the first time during lockdown, and a further % said they did other aposvirtualapos events theyaposve never done before.Popular examples were online quizzes and bingo nights with family, friends and colleagues. In fact, moving to online socialising has actually allowed many people to speak to loved ones more often than before, with % of those with younger children and % of parents of teens agreeing. Asked about a positive memory from lockdown, one parent wrote: Celebrating my daughteraposs st and having all our family on zoom to celebrate with us. Another commented: We have introduced a zoom family quiz on a Saturday night with all of our extended family which has been great fun. Many parents have also taken up playing video games with their kids, and sharing the interest has brought many of them closer together.

One parent wrote: Spending more time with my children and learning to play the video games they like [has been one of the positives of lockdown]. However, the increased use of screens at other times has caused stress and concern for other parents. Parents of both groups - % of those with teens and % of those with younger children - were worried about the additional time their kids have spent staring at their phones during lockdown. Just under a quarter of those with older children also felt anxious about how much time they were spending on social media.

Theyaposve also been having a go at gardening, growing fruit and veg and crafts, and many homes are planning on continuing their new found passions once everything s to normal.  Veryaposs survey found boys were more likely to have spent more time playing a musical instrument and doing DIY. Describing the positives of lockdown as part of the research, one parent wrote: Being able to help more with the kids home schooling as normally I am in work.

The first few weeks are often an eye-opener as they meet all sorts of interesting people and attempt to cook something slightly more substantial than beans on toast.But as with everything in , this year is going to be very dferent for fresh faced students arriving at university in September due to coronavirus Covid-.University bosses have spent the last few months planning and preparing for this yearaposs intake, doing their best to offer as much of the experience as possible while keeping staff and students safe. Virtual lectures, outdoor Freshersapos Week events, online socialising and self-isolating upon arrival are just some of the things teens can expect to see this year. Weaposve spoken to two universities to find out what it will be like to be a fresher in . University of Manchester The university will be doing everything it can to allow new students to have a good experience while keeping safe. There will be virtual meet and greets as well as social-distanced real le events, including outdoor barbecues. Some students moving into halls will have to self-isolate when they arrive, and there will be a new aposbuddy systemapos set up to help people stuck indoors. Professor April McMahon, vice president for teaching, learning and students tellswhat that will look like. She said: Rest assured that we are ready and prepared to welcome students to The University of Manchester and of course our fabulous city, safely.  We are working hard to keep students and staff safe across the campus. There are hand sanitizers available at building and classroom entry points and signs and markings on the floors, stairwells and lts to help with social distancing. We’re also providing our students with two free washable face coverings at the start of semester and will provide guidance on when and where these should be worn, along with other detailed safety advice. Our new students will have a vibrant and redesigned blended welcome and induction programme that will include an outline of our safety features and our ing students will have a transition programme that welcomes them back and covers the safety features that we have put in place. Freshersapos Week University bosses at Manchester have decided to extend their freshersapos fortnight - known as Welcome - to three weeks, and there will also be virtual sessions. The online sessions will offer undergraduates advice and guidance on a number of subjects, including university essentials, wellbeing and how to make the most out of their time in the city. All students moving into hall will complete an online induction and there will be virtual social events.  However there will also be face-to-face activities for first years, all adhering to social-distancing rules, including barbecues and outdoor cinemas. Halls Professor McMahon explains: We have one of the largest university-owned accommodation provisions in the UK. Much of which remained open throughout the pandemic so our halls and residences teams are fully prepared. Arrivals in Halls will be staggered over a period of time and students will be given a date to arrive into halls in order to create the household they will be living in. Where students are sharing accommodation, they are considered a household, which means any UK Government guidance for households will apply, so they don’t need to socially distance from each other and can attend events and activities together.  Students travelling to Manchester from another country may be required to self-isolate for two weeks upon arrival in the UK. We have committed to provide accommodation free of charge to students for this quarantine period. This applies to all countries on the UK Government guidelines list. Should any student be required to self-isolate within our Halls, we will be operating a ‘buddy system’ to ensure that those students have a buddy in place to assist with day to day activities, such as shopping. We have also adjusted our residences contract terms, to provide maximum flexibility for any further disruption that may occur during a student’s time staying with us. Lectures In the first semester, all of Manchesteraposs lectures will be held online - which means students will be able to do them whenever works best for them. However, they will be able to attend QA sessions and other face-to-face sessions with their classmates in small groups during the week.  Professor McMahon explains: Delivering lectures online gives us the extra space to deliver as many of our seminars, tutorials, practicals and labs as we can, on campus, face-to-face, to small, socially distanced groups – and we’re putting safety first for everyone, by sticking with  metre social distancing wherever we can. Our world leading Professors, Lecturers and Researchers are busy working over the summer to plan and adapt their teaching to this new model, to ensure a fantastic student experience. University of Southampton Southampton will also be offering a mix of face-to-face and virtual learning, and staff have been working hard for months to get everything ready for the new academic year. Professor Anna Barney, pro vice-chancellorand associate Dean Education within Engineering and Physical Sciences, tells the Mirror: We know that being a university student in  will be a dferent experience to the norm but we’re doing everything we can to create a COVID-secure environment on campus and ensure that students receive the welcome they expect and deserve as they begin their studies at the University of Southampton. We’re feeling very confident and really looking forward to seeing all of our incoming students for the first time and renewing our relationship with our ing students. The COVID- pandemic has made us rethink and review how we’ll do pretty much everything - from teaching and interacting with our students day-to-day to how we’ll provide services like counselling, transport, accommodation, sports and societies and catering. That’s a very big ask and affects virtually every aspect of student le in some way but we’re working to minimise the challenges for our students and staff to provide reassurance and put measures in place to help us move forward but in the safest possible way. There is no doubting that the coming academic year will be dferent to previous years with new measures in place to keep everyone as safe and healthy as possible. Our absolute priority is the safety, health and well-being of every student and every member of staff. Freshersapos Week The university has decided to make the majority of its introductory entertainment virtual, including its societies fair. Professor Barney tells us:Fresher’s Week – which we call ‘Welcome - is one of our favourite times of the year. It’s a key time to meet other students to forge new friendships, join societies and get to know the University and the city of Southampton. A lot of that can still happen but much of  the experience will be virtual so no ‘bun fight’ this yearand the opportunities to meet others face-to-face will be in smaller groups than usual, but we’ll still have a programme of activities to help our students get settled early on.  Halls Students will still be able to move into both university and privately run accommodation ahead of the academic year, however things will look very dferent. Moving day will be staggered to limit contact, and there will be increased cleaning of all communal areas. Numbers will also be restricted in shared living areas, and face masks must be work.

They then moved to their permanent home in secret at the start of July.  It was built and  and sold in  for over  million, while Harry and Meghanaposs combined wealth is understood to be in the region of  million. The couple reportedly plan to settle in the area and put down lasting roots for themselves and young son Archie - having quit the Royal Family and left the UK in March. A source told PageSix Harry and Meghan have been quietly living in their new home for around six weeks. This is where they want to continue their lives after leaving the UK. This is the first home either of them has ever owned. It has been a very special time for them as a couple and as a family.  The source added the Sussexes never intended to remain in LA, but saw it as a good place to touch base when arriving in the US as Doria lives there. The pair are said to have disliked the press intrusion during their stay in LA.

The situation will be reviewed again in a week’s time.Ms Sturgeon said: “Cases are still far higher than in any other part of the country and considerably higher than they were in Grampian before the outbreak started. So based on an assessment from the incident management team and advice from the chief medical officer, the Scottish Government’s conclusion is that it is not yet possible to lt any of the restrictions that were put in place last week for Aberdeen.”She added: “We continue to watch closely for any signs that the outbreak has spread to Aberdeenshire in any signicant way, but at present we are not placing any additional restrictions on people living in the #Shire.”Ms Sturgeon said police had reported a high level of compliance with the additional restrictions imposed last week and thanked the public for taking heed of them.Aberdeen City Council and Police Scotland had been involved in the decision to continue the local lockdown measures.She added:  “I want to stress that nobody wants these restrictions to be in place for longer than is necessary. They will be reviewed in one week’s time and as soon as we can relax any of them, then we will do.”The restrictions in Aberdeen mean:Ms Sturgeon defended the Test and Protect system when Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie asked why it had been “unable to contain” the virus in Aberdeen.Mr Rennie said the city had gone from “isolated incidents to a full regional lockdown” in a “matter of hours”.Ms Sturgeon claimed the system had worked “very effectively”, saying that the situation in the city would have been far worse without it.The first minister said Test and Protect had identied Aberdeen’s pubs as the source of the outbreak, but stressed that the first line of defence against the virus was people taking action to protect themselves against it.“Test and Protect has worked very effectively in Aberdeen,” she said. “Without test and protect, we would not be dealing with – albeit a large and complex outbreak – but one that I hope is on its way to being contained. We would already be dealing with widespread community transmission.”In response to Aberdeen South and North Kincardine MSP Maureen Watt, Ms Sturgeon said she would press the Treasury to extend the Eat Out to Help Out scheme in the city to help hospitality businesses when the restrictions are relaxed.But the first minister added that it was not yet “safe of sensible” to reopen cafes which do not have an alcohol licence, but added that the situation would be kept under review.The first minister also pledged to look at guidance on childcare arrangements for those Aberdonians who rely on grandparents based in Aberdeenshire, after the issue was raised by Aberdeen Donside MSP Mark McDonald.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It was a wee bit early for him this evening but he is improving all the time.“We hope he comes back into things for the weekend.”There was also encouraging news regarding Jamie Robson, who was involved in a terrible head clash with Hibs player Paul McGinn.Mellon added: “He took a nasty head knock in what was a really honest challenge.“Common sense has to prevail there. Why would he want to knock himself out going for header “He came off the worst but he is all right and we have good medical people here.“We will make sure he is well looked after.”Central defender Ryan Edwards, who made his debut, came off with what looked like a hamstring injury but Mellon was upbeat, saying: “He is all right.

While visiting is suspended for most hospitals.JP McGivney, operations director at Underground, Unit  and BSSC,  launched a crowdfunder last week to save the venues.He spoke of his disappointment at the extension and called for help for the live music scene.JP said: “It is sure to be the final nail in the coffin for a lot of business in Aberdeen.“The government really need to come up with a plan to help the live music scene in the city before it is gone.“There are many music venues and it seems like the roadmap for reopening is further away than ever.“We understand the reason for this but it is disappointing.”Meanwhile, John Anderson, owner of the city#s Staging Post, echoed calls for supportHe said: “I was expecting this decision to be taken to be honest.“I think the way the industry is going we have to have the government step in and provide help.“It is not good for business.  We opened in the hope of getting a last bite of the cherry to get some summertime trade.”Although there had been a slight fall in the number of new cases in Grampian and those directly associated with the cluster, the levels were still too high for relaxing the measures to be a “safe or sensible” course of action.The situation regarding the extension will be reviewed again in a week’s time.During the briefing Ms Sturgeon said: “Cases are still far higher than in any other part of the country and considerably higher than they were in Grampian before the outbreak started.#So based on an assessment from the incident management team and advice from the chief medical officer, the Scottish Government’s conclusion is that it is not yet possible to lt any of the restrictions that were put in place last week for Aberdeen.”She added: “We continue to watch closely for any signs that the outbreak has spread to Aberdeenshire in any signicant way, but at present we are not placing any additional restrictions on people living in the #Shire.”Ms Sturgeon said police had reported a high level of compliance with the additional restrictions imposed last week and thanked the public for taking heed of them.Aberdeen City Council and Police Scotland had been involved in the decision to continue the local lockdown measures.She added:  “I want to stress that nobody wants these restrictions to be in place for longer than is necessary. They will be reviewed in one week’s time and as soon as we can relax any of them, then we will do.”Business leaders have also highlighted the impact the extended lockdown will have on firms.Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen  Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: “It is very disappointing that the full local lockdown restrictions are to stay in place despite a slowing of new infections in the city.#The situation is devastating both for businesses in the city and for consumer confidence, which had been starting to . The longer it goes on, the greater negative impact we will see on the perception of the area from outside, impacting tourism, student recruitment, inward investment and business start-ups.He added: “Hospitality and tourism businesses have been hit particularly hard with the survival of many SMEs balanced on a kne edge.#Having come through the last four months and invested in safely reopening, through no fault of their own many venues are struggling to survive.#Mr Borthwick also said the Eat out to Help Out scheme should be extended, and added: #To be clear, none of the listed ‘cluster’ venues were found to have breached guidelines.#The sector and its supply chain need immediate local grant support as we saw in Leicester with no rates related eligibility criteria. Also additional support through the job retention scheme for the duration and an extension of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme into September by the number of weeks lost.#“There has to be an element of personal responsibility taken too. Behaviour that fails to reflect that things are dferent for now doesn’t just risk people’s health but people’s livelihoods as it could lead directly to some businesses closing permanently. We rightly mourn each of the , deaths attributed to this in Scotland, but we should also mourn every business failure and job loss and askwe have the balance between public health and economic health right #During the briefing Ms Sturgeon said in response to Aberdeen South and North Kincardine MSP Maureen Watt, that she would press the Treasury to extend the Eat Out to Help Out scheme in the city to help hospitality businesses when the restrictions are relaxed.But the first minister added that it was not yet “safe of sensible” to reopen cafes which do not have an alcohol licence, but added that the situation would be kept under review.Adrian Watson, chief executive of Aberdeen Inspired also highlighted the need for people to take #personal responsibility# and spoke of the #unparalleled challenges facing town and city centres.#Mr Watson said the business body fully endorsed moves to to take full advantage of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and was also pushing for other support measures.He said: “Of course, our hospitality businesses in the city have been hit particularly hard, with some , people directly employed in this sector. They have worked hard to put robust safety practices in place and have complied with the guideline and legislative requirements expected of them in the current situation.#However, expectedly there has been learning and we must do all that we can to reduce the risk once they are allowed to re-open.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space.

It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet.

I#d thought with it being near a pre-historic site they might say no, but he thought it sounded great. I was a bit taken aback. The forestry people were also up for it and all of a sudden it was all go,# said Gabi.Weather depending, it should take  days from start to finish. The first job is to clear brambles and other trip hazards before the lime washing can be applied.Dr Aaron Watson from Kilmartin Museum will be documenting the project.Gabi continued: #When I was researching what to white the stumps with I knew I wanted to use something traditional to Scotland that would not contaminate the place. Limewash is used to paint houses here. Then I discovered it creates crystals. Rockart was made using quartz # they would peck at rocks with it to make their marks. I liked the link. It was a good coincidence.#The shape will change depending on where it is seen from. As visitors walk towards it, it will be like an oval but once at the rockart site it will look like a circle.To follow Ormaig Landart Project follow these links:  Instagram: @gstuckemeier"},{"url":null,"title":"rest and be thankful diversion route to close for second night","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFor the second night running the old military road ersion route at the Rest and be Thankful will close.Met Office weather warnings for thunderstorms mean that the route, which runs below the landslide-hit A trunk road, will close overnight again from pm on Tuesday August  as a safety precaution.The local ersion route closed during the hours of darkness on Monday night due to forecast heavy rain, re-opening around am on Tuesday.All traffic will be erted from pm on to the standard ersion route via the A, A, A and A.

Hundreds of drawings, , photographs – I just couldn’t believe it. I still love it and I still want to paint it.‘These paintings are paintings of memories. I have a photographic memory and can always recall a sunset or particular kind of light. Often I am painting things I remember from years and years back, like the lily pond by the Crinan Canal which is gone now, but I still miss it.‘Holland blew me away when I first saw it and Venice did too. I’ve been in Argyll for  years and it blew me away too when I first came here in the s.

I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope. And she instantly responded and said, We dont want your hope, we want clear, cost-effective but very radical policy responses to the climate change.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to.

and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

previous estimates, a study suggests.The results come from the worldrsquos largest home testing programme to find antibodies for the coronavirus, a study involving more than , volunteers and carried out by Imperial College London.Conducted with the use of a simple finger-prick home test said to be easy and accurate enough for mass surveillance studies, the programme suggested % of Englandrsquos population had already been infected with Covid- by July .The . million people that represents is many times higher than the tally of known cases for the entire UK as posted by Johns Hopkins University in the US ndash whose aggregated numbers have become the main reference for monitoring the disease ndash and which listed the countryrsquos case numbers at , as of Thursday morning.Professor Graham Cooke, the research professor of infectious diseases and research lead at Imperial, said the data will have ldquoimportant implications as decisions are taken to ease lockdown restrictions in England.He said the numbers are still ldquorelatively small as a proportion of the countryrsquos population and show that a complete relaxation of lockdown would see a resurgence of the virus.He told the PA news agency: ldquoClearly the numbers are still very big and that explains the high levels of mortality wersquove seen, but as a proportion of the overall population itrsquos still relatively small, except in some groups where the prevalence is higher such as for people of Asian and black ethnicity.ldquoBut obviously it means thatwe had relaxation of the lockdown completely, we wouldnrsquot have a very protected population so we would expect the virus toand so I think that has implications for decisions that are made.The study tracked the spread of infection across England after the pandemicrsquos first peak, with volunteers testing themselves at home between June  and July .People living in London were most likely to have been infected, along with those working in care homes and health care, people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups, and people living in larger households.The programme suggested a total of % of people living in London had Covid- antibodies, compared with less than % in the South West of England.People working in care homesand healthcareed far higher results than people who were not key workers, at %.The study found % of black volunteers had antibodies, the categories of Asian and ldquoother ethnic minorities had % each. The figure among white volunteers was only %.vw,vw,px, px\"Healthcare workers showed a high incidence of having had Covid- People aged - showed the highest incidence of antibodies, at %, while over-s had the lowest rate at just %.Volunteers in the most deprived areas of the country were slightly more likely to have antibodies than those in the wealthiest areas, at % compared with %, while those in households of more than six or seven peoplewere more likely to have had Covid- than those in single or two-person households .Smokers were slightly less likely to have antibodies than non-smokers ndash at % compared with % ndash while % of people with antibodies had shown no symptoms, a figure which rose to % of those aged older than .The studyrsquos authors warned there is was still no firm evidencethat the presence of antibodies means people cannot be re-infected with the virus.Prof Cooke said: ldquoAt the moment we donrsquot know enough about what antibodies mean in terms of protection so we canrsquot assume that people whorsquove got antibodies are protected, andthey are we donrsquot know how long it would be for.Professor Helen Ward, lead author for the study of population prevalence, said the outbreak in the UK appears to have been ldquowidely dispersed from the start.She told BBC Breakfast: ldquoWhat was interestingis that we can tell from people who reported not only having a positive test, but we also asked about their symptoms so we can actually track for most people ndash the % of people who reported symptoms ndash when they think they were infected.ldquoAnd it did start in January, February, and actually it started right across the country, so you canrsquot say that it started in London and spread out.ldquoRight from the beginning, it was widely dispersed.Health Minister Edward Argar hailed the study as an important development in Britainrsquos fight against the coronavirus.He said: ldquoLarge-scale antibody surveillance studies are crucial to helping us understand how the virus has spread across the country and whether there are specic groups who are more vulnerable, as we continue our work to drive down the spread of the disease.ldquoWe donrsquot yet know that antibodies provide immunity to coronavirus, but the more information we can gather on this virus, and the easier we can make it for people to participate in these studies, the better equipped we will be to respond.ldquoThe British public have already played a massive part in helping to keep the country safe and Irsquod urge them to consider signing up to one of the many vital surveillance studies taking place over the coming months as part of our national testing effort.Commenting on the research, Liam Smeeth, professor of clinical epidemiology at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said: ldquoAs the authors make clear, the tests used were able to provide useful surveillance data at the population level, but the tests are not accurate enough to be applied to iniduals to guide their behaviour.ldquoA crucial uncertainty is that we still do not know the extent to which antibody levels indicate immunity from infection, or indicate whether people are able to carry and pass on the virus.Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, who also was not involved in the research, said: ldquoThe finding that % of the population have antibodies against the coronavirus causing Covid- matches very closely with a smaller study published by the ONSin June.He added: ldquoAt the beginning of the UK epidemic, it was estimated that approximately % of the population would need to be infected by this coronavirus for herd immunity to be acquired.ldquoThese findings therefore imply that, for that to happen, we would have needed to see a much greater level of community infection, perhaps a -fold increase, with correspondingly increased levels of illness and death..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Study suggests % of people in England have had Covid-"},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"SCOTLANDs first articial surf park has taken a step closer to reality after more planning permission was approved.Artist drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project -

Amanda had been diagnosed in November  and given  weeks to live.David and Trevor are raising money for Pancreatic Cancer UK after Trevor was diagnosed with an aggressive form of the condition in November last year,  months after Amanda.His diagnosis is terminal and he has received  chemotherapy sessions.Trevor was also given  weeks to live but chose to go through treatment to extend his le.He is receiving more treatment in September.This is not the first time that the pair have embarked on a tour like this and it was this previous trip that inspired them to go again.In Christmas , David received a present to go on a motorbike ride and the following February he left with Trevor to go on a -day tour around Europe.However, they were on their trip during the Beast from the East snowstorm of early , which saw them ride through snow in mainland Europe.David, who owns a couple of coffee shops in London, said: ldquoWe went through the Swiss Alps, France and Italy and people were following us through France and beeping their horns at us, so we said thatwe ever do this again that we must do it for charity.The pair then set up their own website, called the Hairless Bikers www.hairlessbikers, inspired by lsquoHairy Bikersrsquo David Myers and Si King with their own twist, as both David and Trevor are bald.The pair were planning their next trip until Amandarsquos terminal diagnosis, with David saying the news came ldquoall of a sudden.After Amandarsquos death, David spent time dealing and coming to terms with his loss and then Trevor received his diagnosis.And when the coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year, it added to an already dficult year.The pair were waiting for Trevor to finish his chemotherapy before starting the tour, with Trevor phoning David last month and askinghe wanted to go.David told the Courier before he set off: ldquoWersquove always said we will do it but now itrsquos all go.ldquoTrevor phoned me last weekend and said: lsquoLetrsquos just do it.rsquo If we donrsquot do it now then itrsquos never going to happen.ldquoWe thought about all of the news going on at the moment andanything happens or we need to come back we are just in Europe so can easily catch a plane home.Ahead of the trip, David said he was ldquovery excited, adding he was just going to focus on riding and see what happened.He added: ldquoWe wonrsquot stop laughing, wersquoll be like little kids.An initial target of pound was raised, with more than pound, raised in a few days.David saidan average of pound a day could be raised ldquothat will be brilliant.Donate at www.facebook donate  "},{"url":null,"title":"column-tory-disarray-not-reassuring","story":"It cannot be reassuring for the Scottish Tories that their leader has only been in the position since February and has now left the party in disarray.It is clear the party do not hold Scottish Parliament seats in a high regard, given that it is looking likely that the next leader will be Douglas Ross, who is not even currently an MSP.Scottish Parliament seats require a member who is willing to commit time and effort to their constituency, they are not simply a stepping stone for jumping into a leadership bid.If you compare the Toriesrsquo leadership with that of Nicola Sturgeon over the last few months, with her clear and consistent messaging throughout the Covid- crisis, it is easy to see why polls for the SNP and independence are through the roof.I know that many are looking forward to enjoying the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which will offer discounts of up to  per cent at restaurants and cafeacutes throughout August.I welcome this help for local businesses, and I am sure that this will benefit them in their restarts following lockdown.I would like to stress, however, that guidelines should always be followed within these establishments.That means that you should be socially distancing from those who are not from your household or extended household, and you should maintain good hygiene by regularly washing your hands for  seconds, as well as not touching your face.To keep yourself safe, it is important to use businesses that are taking these measures seriously and putting safety precautions in place to protect their customers.This week I will be hosting the first meeting of the Esk River Improvement Group.I look forward to working with them to make progress towards cleaning up the Esk."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-mist-midges-memories","story":"Oh and I forgot to mention the midges, which add a particularly Highland flavour to any camping trip up north.Such was our experience last weekend after we managed to find a campsite that was open. We managed just one overnight stay in Glen Nevis.It has always been a favourite glen of mine.Its beauty challenges the majestic Glencoe, but its landscape is gentler and less rugged, and the upper reaches of the glen take you back in time, to the majesty of the ancient Caledonian forest.In the days when I was a tour guide, I always thought that mist and rain were an essential part of a trip to the Highlands.People would refer to hot and sunny weather as good weather, but Irsquod always say that in the Highlands mist and rain can be good weather too.On such days, the weather would add the veil of mystery and unpredictability that makes the landscape so intriguing.Hardly ever was the approach to Glencoe the same because of the weather it changes the landscape in ways the imagination could never predict.Swirling mists which dress the peaks, layers of low lying cloud which suddenly break to allow sparkling rays of sunshine itrsquos spine-tinglingly magical.On days of so called good weather, when the skies were a cloudless blue, I always felt there was something missing in the experience.I know all this might sound like patter from VisitScotland attempting to persuade rain drenched tourists that they are lucky to have experienced the true mystery of our country but for me it has always been true.Of course, days of endless pelting rain are no fun and can spoil a holiday, but for me, some mist and rain, in moderation, makes a Highland holiday all the more memorable.Such was our experience last weekend, with two days that seemed to be in dferent seasons.When we arrived we were lucky to be able to put up the tent just in time, before the rain got heavy.Itrsquos always an awkward moment for me putting up our tent in full view of other campers, as we struggle to remember which pole goes where and try not to look like we need assistance.It couldrsquove been easy to be despondent at the weather. Dark brooding clouds shrouded the sides of Ben Nevis, bringing rain that threatened to dampen everything but I refused to let it dampen our spirits.I recited the famous quote: ldquoIn Scotland there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing.We had a hearty camp stove meal and then set off for our walk in the Nevis Gorge.Itrsquos a well kent walk now, but when I was first taken many years ago before the internet it was a relatively unknown secret. I still remember the sense of awe as I heard the roar of the river below, and the sight of the distant waterfall An Steall as we emerged from the gorge.Our trick was to go on our walk when it was raining, and after teatime so we had the place almost to ourselves, well apart from the midges.Our midge repellent was gold dust, and Irsquove always found the trick in avoiding midges is to keep moving, which we did, except for once, and we momentarily paid the price.It was a walk in the childhood footsteps of my younger self, where my young children were re-pacing along the route also taken by their older siblings years ago.It was about saying ldquohere is a place important to me, part of who I am itrsquos yours now,you want it to be.Yet not saying it with words, but by making memories that I hope will last as long as mine have.The rain and mist was all part of it, and yes even the midges. As often happens, the weather began to clear as we headed back.The sun broke through and the clouds developed a sparkling yellow tint. The mountains appeared, like giants awoken and rising to their true height.Sunshine briefly warmed our faces and it seemed a gt from the gods for our endurance.The kids danced and sang the song ldquoI can see clearly now the rain has gone as they saw a rainbow.I knew the rain hadnrsquot really gone so we didnrsquot dally.We made it back to the car, tired with sore legs, but before the next dark cloud arrived.That evening we recounted our experiences in the tent, and I told stories about the Jacobites and the old Highland way of le, and the connection to the Battle of Prestonpans on our own doorstep.The kids listened, partly because we were camping and they had no screens, so no choice but Irsquod like to believe partly also because we were in a land where stories and legends are steeped in the soil and they now felt a small part of them.It lashed with rain all night. But its rage had ended by morning and the new day welcomed us with sunshine.New adventures beckoned, with other memories to impart, on what was to become our sunny day.Loch Oich, rich in family memory and where the ashes of both my parents were scattered.Then Loch Ness, a fitting end to a pilgrimage, especially for my monster daft wee boy, and his sisters who love the mystery of the story.Such was our short ldquostaycation this summer.Wersquod followed what I have always called The Road of Legends which is the title of my yet to be published novel, an abridged version of which will be

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to.

longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.Sleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"new-head-education-named","story":"Ms Brown is currently the chief operating officer for education with the local authority and will take the place of Fiona

national outrage.In East Lothian, , pupils received some grades which had been marked down.Only  of the , young people who were due to sit SQA exams had any of their final grades increased.The results dropped through letterboxes last Tuesday and sparked a furious backlash from students who received lower grades than expected.Erin Campbell, , Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor Musselburgh, said many friends had been left worried and scared after the initial results came out, warning that the fiasco had been ldquobad for their mental health.Erin, who was a sixth-year student at Musselburgh Grammar School, said: ldquoOn a personal level, I was lucky to receive the results that I needed in order to move on to university however, I am aware of a lot of young people, including close friends, who were left scared and worried after not receiving a conditional offer to uni that was reliant on these results.ldquoThis badly impacted their mental health, particularly during the period of uncertainty before [Education Secretary] John Swinneyrsquos announcement [on Tuesday].Student protests were held in Glasgow and Edinburgh and politicians piled on pressure for the Scottish

Speaking after the decision, Mr Gray said: ldquoGiven the scale of the exam results scandal, it was inevitable that many local students would have been affected. I have certainly had a number of young people and parents contacting me over the last week to express their concerns about their grades being adjusted down by the SQA and the impact it might have on their futures.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos u-turn will bring relief to these worried young people and their families as they will now see their estimated results reinstated.ldquoHowever, the fact remains they should not have had to experience this worry and uncertainty in the first place.

The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

The Pull Of The Stars takes place across three days in , where on a makesht, thoroughly understaffed maternity ward in Dublin, Nurse Julia Power is trying to support pregnant women through labour, while Spanish Influenza goes about its insidious, fatal work. Eerie comparisons with Covid asideJulias observations on the odds pregnant women in poverty already face, and the havoc wreaked on their bodies from having too many children, too young, is devastating - and fascinating - to read.Donoghue deftly weaves in politics, policy, the impact of war, feminism, violence and the minutiae of changing bed pans and sterilising instruments, while dealing with dismissive male doctors and birthing babies. And thats all alongside the awful things happening in Irish convents and childrens homes. But throughout, the pragmatic, thoughtful Julia keeps the overwhelming darkness shes tackling, in abeyance - just about. A powerful, persistent, highly detailed and incredibly moving book that speaks through time. Donoghue is an absolute marvel of a writer.Ella WalkerMiss Bensons Beetle by Rachel Joyce is published in hardback by Doubleday, priced pound. .The latest book from the bestselling author of The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is about an expedition to find the golden beetle of New Caledonia. Set in the stultied s, Miss Bensons Beetle considers female friendship in the unlikeliest of situations.

The collection also covers relationships, religion, family and school, skilfully highlighting the tension between the latter when describing day-long hair styling in Jail Letter: \"Mum, my scalp burns! Ungrateful! Look at you, beautul as Winnie Mandela! I dont know who this is but it doesnt sound like someone Ben Clark will fancy.\" Longs use of dialect is one of her strongest points , while one of the most effective poems, , uses form to indicate a skipping and speeding memory of abuse.Laura PatersonX+Y: A Mathematicians Manesto for Rethinking Gender by Eugenia Cheng is published in hardback by Profile Books, priced pound. .This book does not so much rethink gender as , remove it from the equation, thus sidestepping any issues of gender-based discrimination. Where it is useful though, is in shting the debate in a way that allows a comparison of characteristics often associated with male or female, while avoiding the need to constantly qualy any statements with the awkward tag of not all women or not all men. As the author herself states, this is a reframing of the debate, as inspired by her background in category theory. Her major sht is in the creation of the terms congressive and ingressive as useful shorthand for traits that might roughly be summarised as caring and sharing, as opposed to competitive and inidualistic. In the end, however, Chenssolutions seem to rely on iniduals without power, learning to be more assertive, and those with it, learning to act in ways that are more inclusive rather than on any kind of structural change.Lucy WhetmanChildrens book of the weekThank You, Heroes: A Celebration Of Our Key Workers by Patricia Hegarty and Michael Emmerson is published in paperback by Little Tiger, priced pound .

Theyre the one point of contact between the vehicle and the road, meaning any issue with them could prove disastrous. Its why its so important to check them. Look at the sidewalls for any cuts or damage which could lead to a puncture, and scope out the general condition of the rubber. If its cracked and dry, it might be time for a change.And, of course, look at the tread depth. The legal limit in the UK and Ireland is .mm, and one of the easiest ways to tellyour tyres are within this is with a p coin. Simply insert the coin into the tread groovesthe outer band of the coin is obscured by tyre, then youre within the limit. If you can see the band, the tyres need replacing.Wed check the tyre pressures too. Most garages have air compressors to top up air . Check the required pressure for your tyres by consulting your cars handbook or on the instruction  inside the fuel filler cap. Adjust your pressures accordingly and not only will your tyres perform more effectively, but itll save you money in fuel, too.OilOil is crucial to the smooth running and operation of your cars engine. Without it, youre in for a whole heap of trouble. Its why ensuring your cars oil levels are correct is so important, as without a proper amount, theres the potential for a lot of damage to take place. Yet despite being so crucial, its simple to check. Simply wait for the engine to coolits been running, and find the dipstick within the engine bay. Its often highlighted with a yellow handle, butyoure struggling to find it, consult the cars handbook.Then, once found, pull out the dipstick and clean it with a rag or paper towel. Re-insert it into the engine and take it out once more now, youll be able to see the level of oil in the engine via the dipsticks markers.If its too low, add more oil. Only do a bit at a time, and repeat the dipstick process each time - you dont want to overfill it.Windscreen washer fluidParticularly during the summer months when theres more dust and insects on the road, making sure youve got enough windscreen washer fluid is important. Much like oil, its dangerous to run out of, but easy to check. Again, look under the bonnet, this time for a blue cap. If the levels are low, simply top up with the correct washer fluid. Avoid using just water.CoolantCoolant is integral to keeping your cars engine at the correct temperature. During summer this is very important, but its just as key during colder months too. Though its unlikely that your coolant levels will have dropped, its always worthwhile checking the tank - again, this is typically found under the bonnet. Only ever use the manufacturers recommended coolant to top up the systemits low.FuelIt might sound simple, but ensuring that youve got plenty of fuel in the tank in readiness for a long journey can easily slip peoples minds. In fact, plenty of drivers undertake a trip and forget to fill up, resulting in a fair amount of stress during travel.Before you set off, check your fuel gauge and ensure youve got enough to get you to your destination. If not, its worth filling up closer to home, where you know the location of filling stations. Leaving it until later could result in the stressful situation of having to find a fuel station in an unfamiliar area.LightsLights can be an aspect of a car which are easily forgotten during the lighter months when the days are longer and the nights shorter. However,youre making a longer trip, theres a good chance that youll be driving in darkness as you near your destination, which makes fully working lights crucial.Check that your headlights and indicators are working up front, and test the rear lights and brake lights too. Wed give the hazards a test for good measure too - you never know when you might need them."},{"url":null,"title":"create-seaside-themed-garden","story":"Award-winning garden designer Joe Perkins, who lives close to the sea in Brighton, and Lynette Talbot, chairperson of Sidmouth In Bloom, offer their tips on how you can recreate beach vibes in your outdoor space...Set the scene with sandy soil or gravel\"Ideally, youd need sandy soil or a gravel footpath. Gravel gardens can make it look like a beach,\" says Cha Gold medallist Perkins, whose  Facebook show garden Growing The Future will be displayed at next years show.\"You could do worse than put down four or five inches of gravel, and many seaside plants would be happy growing in it. If you have poor drainage or heavy soil, build up a gravel layer, adding sand or soil to add nutrients.:Letters: When it comes to language, lets live and let live\"A lot of coastal plants will be perfectly happy growing into that layer and many of them dont need much soil, andthey do, like sea kale, they will have a deep tap root which theyll send down to stabilise themselves.\"\"Treat your seaside garden like an alpine garden,\" says Talbot. \"You want free-draining soil, which you can build up like a rockery or clf face, incorporating shorter grasses like carex or small miscanthus, to give you the feel of the wispy grasses along the edge of the shoreline.\"Pick suitable plants\"If you like the spartan look, you could make a gravel garden planted with rivers of thyme, dwarf myrtle bushes and some evening primrose coming through it.\"Stock up on free-draining species\"Other good plants to create a sea feel would include santolinas, lavenders, silver-leaf plants and some sea poppies, which need to be planted in a very free-draining, gritty soil, with a good sand and compost mix because they dont like being in a very fertile garden. Known as the horned poppy, these perennials have lemon flowers and large, bean-like seed heads,\" continues Talbot.:Herald Diary: Getting to grips with a Titanic struggle\"Thrtis another good choice and comes in colours from white to darkish red. You can buy any of the Ballerina Series in the alpine section of a local nursery.\" She also recommends sea holly , sedums, artemisia and mallows.For border colour, you could go with acanthus, euphorbias, Phlomis russelianaand valerian , erigeronand low-growing herbs such as thyme, lavender and rosemary, Perkins suggests.Add seaside accessories\"Create a small area with some shingle and put some posts on the side, with a rope link between them or some firemens buckets or tyres or rings which could be painted red to resemble lebuoys, or get some glass fishermens jars. You might be able to get hold of some crayfish or lobster baskets, which give an area a nice seaside feel,\" Talbot advises.\"Thick ropes, which you often see tying a boat to a mooring, are a great accessory. You can get a garden-sized boat and plant that up, putting it on a small shingle bed, with alpine grit over the top to finish.\"Display beach finds carefullyPerkins says you have to be careful when putting shells or drtwood youve found on beach-combing walks on display at random points in the garden. \"Instead of dotting things around, make a display cabinet of perhaps a series of shells, which makes sense of them being there.\"Create a beach-inspired social spot\"For me, being on the beach is about getting together in the evening and relaxed social gatherings, so I would think about fire pits, deck chairs and that sort of low-slung seating you can really relax into.

Yezidi men were summarily killed. Women and girls were subjected to sexual violence, including sexual slavery, and other crimes under international law. Boys were indoctrinated and forced to fight for IS.I spoke to Hanan ndash and other Yezidi women forcibly separated from their children born of sexual violence ndash for an Amnesty International report, Legacy of Terror: The Plight of Yezidi Child Survivors of ISIS.During captivity, Hanan was repeatedly raped by the IS fighter who took her as a ldquoslave, and gave birth to her daughter, Fadia.

Fadia was amazing.When Hanan finally reached refugee a camp in Syria, she did not identy herself as Yezidi for fear of being forced to abandon Fadia.

Many public toilets are still closed and so are many campsites, so the availability of sites to stock up on water and dispose of waste are severely limited.

Everyone wins. And all shall have prizes.:IndyRef: New poll shows % would back independence as SNP set for record Holyrood majorityMind you, I dont think Mr Swinney will be interfering in many future examinations. I cant think of any ministerial U-turn that has been quite as humiliating as this one. Not least because Mr Swinney spent half of his statement defending the very moderation system that he had just discarded.No serious government can conduct its business in this way. Mr Swinney gave no principled explanation of why he was abandoning the work of the supposedly independent SQA ndash other than that a number young people felt that the system was unjust. That is undeniably true and we all felt for them.But this capitulation leaves the SQA in an impossible position, and brings the whole examination process into question. Indeed, I dont see how the SQA can continue in its present form. Certainly, it cannot conduct its normal moderation of exam results with any confidence in future years.And nor can Mr Swinney. He must surely go now, after this fiasco, and without delay. Someone must come in to restore respect for the standards in Scottish education and serve the last rites on the Qualications Authority.Indeed, standardised assessment through competitive examinations looks to have had its day. As Mr Swinney hinted, it has become increasingly unpopular in recent years. Though every country including Finland, the leading edge of pedagogical progressivism, uses objective testing.But after this fiasco, examinations like the Highers will surely lose their unique status and will likely be supplanted by teacher estimates of ability which, according to Mr Swinney, is the most reliable way to gauge academic achievement. This, even though he himself concedes that in the past teacher assessment has been no reliable guide to exam performance.The impact on grade inflation will be as the First Minister herself forecast last week ldquoincredible. A % increase in Highers grades means that this years students will forever be marked out as the year when exam credibility went out the window.Whoever called the process by which the Scottish Qualication Authority adjusts exam scores to reflect past school performance ldquomoderation had a dry sense of humour. It has caused fury amongst teachers, pupils, parents.The anger shows no sign of moderating even after Swinneys desperate attempt to put a lid on the worst exam crisis in  years. This was a statement that was as humiliating as it was self-contradictory.:UK falls into recession after lockdown sees record contractionHe began by explaining atwhy the moderation applied by the SQA did not disproportionately downgrade students from deprived areas, as has been widely claimed. This is because the grade inflation, against historic standards, was higher in schools in these areas, at %, than in schools in more prosperous areas, which inflated by only around %. Greater moderation was therefore applied out of fairness, not classism.He then commended the SQAs ldquoopen and transparent adjustment methodology and insisted that it was ldquoin use throughout the UK and across the world\". But, er, not in Scotland any more. Mr Swinney then let the algorithmic cat out of the bag by pointing out that exam moderation happens every year to some extent as the SQA, and its English equivalent Ofqual, manipulate grade boundaries. But not presumably in future.He even announced, solemnly, that the remit of the SQAwas to ensure that every student got ldquothe qualications they deserved. The teacher estimates: ldquo awarded without moderation, he said ldquo would have led to an increase in pass rates without precedent.Sothe methodology was so fair and robust, why was he over-ruling the independent SQA and allowing this unprecedented grade inflation to take place  Well, Mr Swinney had spoken to young people who felt ldquotheir future was being determined by statistical modelling. The credibility of exam grades was of secondary importance to ldquothe risk that people would lose faith in the system. Well, they certainly will now.But does anyone seriously think that the SQA actually marked down working class students because they were living in a deprived postcode  Of course not. The SQA anyway subjected its moderation regime to an Equalities Impact Assessment ndash as it is obliged to do ndash before it published them.Moderation by algorithm is a pretty blunt instrument and doesnt take account of inidual performance. But, as Mr Swinney says, it is very widely used. Capitulating to grade inflation of up to % may win political points in the short term, but it will store up big problems for the future.:John Swinneys SQA U-Turn: Seven things you need to knowEvery year, grade boundaries move up and down to ensure fairness and comparable outcomes. Tens of thousands of pupils have their exam results routinely moderated. The English equivalent of the SQA, Ofqual, uses a very similar ldquostandardisation model against which to correct scores which depart from the historical average.Englands pandemic moderation is, according to reports, even greater than ours ndash % of grades have been adjusted downwards from the estimates provided by teachers, against % in Scotland. We wont know the final figures until tomorrowwhen the English A level results are unveiled. But, strangely, there has not been anything like the controversy over moderation that we have seen here.The inconvenient truth is that the Scottish ldquopandemic cohort, as they are already being dubbed, has exchanged one unfairness for another. They may have got the grades they and their teachers wanted, but those grades will forever be tainted by the chaotic and unprincipled way in which they were awarded.

We await the Governmentrsquos response. This week Labour also called for the licensing of grouse shooting after a big increase in the illegal killing of birds during the lockdown.But in Scotland, Irsquom afraid, the signs of progress are not good. For a start, the Werritty report was based on the flawed premise that driven grouse shooting can be made acceptable. Werritty was explicitly looking for ways in which grouse moors could continue to be a part of the economy instead of questioning whether Scotlandrsquos countryside should tolerate a business that harms the countryside ndash through the burning of heather, for example.The reportrsquos conclusion on licensing also ended up being rather limp because the group that led the report was ided, which meant the compromise of suggesting a licensing systemthere is no improvement in bird of prey populations. Which gives the Scottish Government a get-out: wersquore waiting, theyrsquoll say, to seetherersquos been an improvement hellip still waiting hellip still waiting. The Government has also shown a lack of urgency in responding to Werritty. It does not look good.There are also serious question marks over whether licensing will work. First off, the people who are illegally killing birds of prey are unlikely to be deterred by a licensing systemtheyrsquore not deterred by the law as it stands Scotland for more than  years.Therersquos also a danger thatan ineffective licensing system will be introduced and then everything will just carry on as normal. I spoke to the conservationist Mark Avery about this recently and his view was that the whole idea of licensing depended on how robust the system was a weak one would pretty much allow the wildle criminals to carry on regardless.Some people in the shooting community feel theyrsquore being unfairly singled out over this. I remember speaking to one guy who runs a training school for gundogs who said he was frustrated that certain ways of killing animals ndash fishing for example ndash were seen as socially acceptable whereas shooting had a stigma attached to it. A farrier also told me that at least shooting enthusiasts are being honest about killing animals ndash townies on the other hand will happily tuck into burgers and fish and chips and yet judge people for shooting birds or deer.In some ways, I can see where the country sports enthusiasts are coming from on that one ndash for most of us, grouse shooting is a weird and distant practice and maybe that makes it easier to support moves to control it. But fishing doesnrsquot involve killing every other species in the water, whereas the ideal grouse moor from the point of view of landowners and gamekeepers is one thatrsquos devoid of any predator, which leads to predator control on a mass scale ndash legal and illegal.That is the key to the problem: a model that is effectively based on the killing of birds of prey. Perhaps licensing can do something to improve it. I hope so. Perhaps the Government will support licensing. I hope for that too. But it may be that it all rests on a simple question. Mark Thomas of the RSPB said this week that most of the bird of prey deaths theyrsquod seen during lockdown were linked in some way to shooting. So the question is: will licensing change the behaviour of those people  Or do we have to go further and ban driven grouse shooting completely Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A time to hit the reset button across public le.I am no longer a party political player, and I have written in these pages on many occasions that I have found the SNP in government to be reliable and competent.Since its election in , a relatively small group of talented people have managed the country perfectly well, however the key word in this sentence is \"managed\". This has not been a radical government, and given the inevitability of its continuation until at least , we are all invested in that changing.In Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney, the country has two people who, due to the formerrsquos historic popularity, are almost uniquely placed to take the country with them whatever they decide to do. Leaving aside the independence issue, to leave a legacy worth remembering, it is time to throw caution to the wind.The obvious first, and probably most important example, is uppermost in our thoughts this week: education. Our focus currently is on an acute issue in the form of the exam results, just as a few months ago it was on the acute question of when children wouldto school. But those are snapshots, stories, symptoms.:Jobs guarantee for young Scots backed by poundm fundingThe real issue here is not the acute but the chronic we have a state school system which is inadequately preparing our children for the world which greets them when they leave. I have now acquired direct experience of this, with four children in the state school system.It is not hyperbolic to say that I have encountered almost nothing which has genuinely impressed me. We are living a lie in this country, blindly accepting old tropes about Scotland having a world-leading education system. We do not. It is unambitious, with very little encouragement of the pursuit of excellence. It is secretive, with decisions iniably favouring councils and unions at the expense of pupils and parents, who are often treated as an inconvenience. And it is iniquitous, with thosewho have been able to pay for a house in a good catchment area effectively purchasing a chance for our children to emerge unscathed.Education leads to economic success. Education leads to high tax receipts. Education leads to good health and wellbeing. Education reduces welfare dependency. Education is everything. But we are sleepwalking into a national catastrophe because we are too afraid to admit that we are struggling.Today, the education secretary John Swinney faces a confidence vote a trap laid by opposition smelling political blood. Fine Irsquom certain the SNP would do the samethe shoe was on the other foot. But Irsquom not interested in that. As a citizen I recognise that the SNP will be in power for the next term of government and I believe that Mr Swinney has the skill, knowledge and respect to lead a rethink of everything. Starting age. Term times. Class sizes. Curriculum. Everything. We are all invested in his success.This is true not only of education. When the story of Covid  is told, Irsquod put the mortgage on the NHS emerging from that story as the hero. The NHS, as has often been said, is this countryrsquos national religion, and the hysteria which accompanies any sceptical comment about its quality ensures that the only political intervention it attracts is no-strings-attached increases in funding.:Letters: This is the final nail in the coffin of our education systemThat is no longer acceptable. As we try to analyse, in Scotland and the UK, whether we have coped well with Covid  relative to our peers, to leave the NHS out of that discussion would be an act of national self-harm.There are facts here, and they sit stubbornly in the way of the narrative. Our NHS has  percent fewer doctors per head than the OECD average. We have barely half the average number of hospital beds per head. We have less than half the number of MRI scanners, and one-third the number of CT scanners per head.We scrape into the OECD top- for survival rates for major cancers ndash colorectal, breast and cervical. We perform even worse ndash outside the top  ndash in mortality rates for heart attack, haemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke. And all of this is despite comparable financing of the system. Readers, we are not the envy of the world.This is not OK. We should stop thinking this is OK. We should stop saying this is OK. It demeans us to do so. You can support taxpayer-funded healthcare, as I do, and support the people who work in it, as I do , whilst also advocating a renewal of the delivery mechanism.However the critical first hurdle in a national renewal ndash the part we in Scotland have always found ourselves unable to leap ndash is to admit that we have problems. That we too often bask in our own mediocrity. So herersquos one idea. The Scottish Government should create a small National Renewal Unit. Give them a big travel budget.

The credibility of a nationrsquos education system is based mainly on its examination processes and is the point at which international comparisons are often made. Those looking in from abroad must draw the conclusion that the robustness of the Scottish system has vanished and, in its place, are standards that should be openly questioned.

Despite assurances to the contrary from the SNP, the results for  cannot, by any sensible logic, be seen as comparable to years gone by.

If the Cabinet Secretary had any honour, he would resign immediately, but as a career politician, I am sure his only thoughts are how to dig the SNP out of yet another hole.John Campbell, Glasgow.NATURAL justice required that the Government reverse the iniquitous \"moderation\" process applied this year, by the SQA, to teacher-based student assessments. The decision should be welcomed. But this is merely a first step to what needs to be the most fundamental reform.A claim that this decision will destroy the \"credibility\" of end of schooling certication in Scotland, because it is unfair to those who earned their grades in previous years, is woefully misinformed. There is an important historic injustice to be addressed but it is not that those who earned so-called \"good\" grades in the past have had these devalued by the awards in . It is that the SQA system that so grossly underestimated the achievements and performance of learners this year, has been doing the same thing to students, mainly from disadvantaged backgrounds, for at least  years.Evidence of predictive validity ndash the extent to which end of schooling grades correlate with subsequent performance in either higher education or employment ndash is conspicuous by its absence. If employers and universities base their admissions processes on grades earned through external examinations alone, they are truly \"buying a pig in poke\".The reductionist myth that it is possible to devise a \"national\" examination system that can accurately and fairly assess, at the end of formal schooling, the multarious skills and abilities of young people and convert these into meaningful numerical scales is plainly erroneous. The counter argument is that national assessments merely serve as an elaborate ndash but grossly unfair ndash social sorting process. This means that those with sufficient funds to live in \"leafy suburbs\", employ private tutors or patronise independent schools, can ensure the progress of their offspring to the most prestigious universities and careers.What would be a genuine insult to credibility would be a , after this year, to the previous system. It is welcome that there is to be an immediate inquiry. What this process needs to do is open to public scrutiny the assumptions and processes that have led us to this sorry state. What we do not need is another, glacially-slow-moving bureaucratic grand committee, led by the \"great and good\" and stuffed with nominees from education quangos ndash such as HM Inspectorate, Education Scotland and the SQA. The unimaginative institutional groupthink of these bodies is a major cause of the problems we face ndash they are most unlikely to spawn a solution.We should congratulate all those learners who earned their awards in this dficult year. We must also acknowledge a debt to the young people who took to the streets to protest at the injustice done to them. In this they have alerted a much wider community to the source of serious inequalities in Scottish society.

It smacks of total panic and complete capitulation.An independent body of markers will, in my opinion, always be best placed to grade exam results. This is because, unlike teachers marking their own pupils, independent markers have no emotional ties with the pupils they are grading, and therefore can mark dispassionately and objectively no vested interest in the school doing well, and possibly rising up educational league tables, and use a standardised system across the whole of Scotland, not one applied dferently in each school, by each teacher, most of whom, no doubt, will have had little experience of objectively grading course work.In times of crisis, one expects onersquos political leaders to maintain a cool head in the penalty box. Instead of that, the SNP has gone into a blind panic and, at a stroke, has degraded this yearrsquos exam results and potentially put the future of the SQA in doubt.A definite \"E\" grade performance from Mr Swinney and Ms Sturgeon, Must try harder, I think is the phrase that best applies here.Stuart Brennan, Glasgow G.HOLYROOD has descended through farce into some form of infantile Punch and Judy Show where the aim is to score points and humiliate opponents rather than to further the interests of the general public.

Imagine the furorethe original announcement showed pass-rates had soared to the now readjusted level there would have been demands that the outrageous results were downgraded as being unrealistic and that Mr Swinney should go.Why isnrsquot the finger of accusation being pointed at the SQA for having an assessment system where the exam results are so out of alignment with the estimations of teachers in both the private and public sectors who actually know the students  One-off exams are an imperfect form of assessing ability, we all know knew ldquosmart people who were good at passing exams but who couldnrsquot put a nut in the proverbial monkeyrsquos mouth what I canrsquot understand is how so many of them end up as politicians and civil servants.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.THIS week I wrote about the inequity facing poor students whose success was capped by statistics not merit . We have now seen the Education Secretary apologise and share how long he knew about issues. Signicant issues have been facing education for some time now around assessment, inequity, culture and governance. The announced retrospective review of the most recent crisis may collate issues. These were rightly raised by academics calling out issues. Some issues sadly remain now for eternity ndash teachers judgment was questioned and some students got uplted grades because the system rewarded rich, high-attaining schools.However, where are the forward-looking improvements  Education reform in Scotland has been spasmodic and unsatisfactory. One academic suggested only a third of reforms were successful. Furthermore there is still no date for the OECD review. Why canrsquot this happen remotely  Indeed, Scottish education missed a wider opportunity during this crisis. Shts to school online learning and other much-needed reform have not taken place.

Pamela Walker, NHSO ambulatory care manager has explained that services are gradually being remobilised, with the situation ing to normal, but there are limitations on the number of patients who could be operated on every day due to the additional COVID- restrictions. “We can now do four general anaesthetics every day ,# she said. #However, patients needing local anaesthetics are being fitted in around the general anaesthetics and this is reducing the number of those still waiting for a procedure increasing the number of procedures being safely undertaken.”The theatre Day Unit teams are also limited to doing surgeries linked to one discipline a day as space in the Day Unit is reduced from ten to six trolleys. This is because some of the space normally used for theatre Day Unit has been given over to the COVID ventilation unit which, is to remain in place for the foreseeable future.“But we are working through the lists and we are confident that all those waiting will be attended to,” Ms Walker added. “While some people might feel we have forgotten about them, this is not the case. The impact of COVID means there have been long delays.”Senior charge nurse, Diane Gray, said those coming for a general anaesthetic had to have a COVID test  days before their surgery, then shield with everyone in their household for  days, then have another COVID test the day before their operation.“We understand that not everyone wants to or can do this,# she said.#If a patient is waiting for elective surgery but they don’t want to shield for two weeks, they can let us know and we will contact them again when the guidance changes. It is important for them to know that they will not be prejudiced or moved to the bottom of the list.Both Ms Walker and Ms Gray said that the decision to have an elective procedure during this time rested with the patient. They understand that this is a very dficult time, that the situation is continually changing and that not everyone wants to come into a hospital environment.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These estimates, based on their work during the school year, were then submitted to a Scottish Qualications Authoritymoderation system which downgraded the results — on criteria including the historic performance of the school.This sparked a huge backlash from students and politicians.Orkney Islands Council’s executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said he was “delighted” by Tuesday’s announcement, made by an under-fire education secretary John Swinney.He said: “The signicant and detailed work carried out by teaching staff and school managers was to an incredibly high standard, and I had every confidence in the approach and final outcome presented to the SQA.”The u-turn now means that teacher estimates will be reinstated, and there will be no need for any appeals process.In Orkney, the downgrading of awards totalled .The total number of exam entries at Kirkwall Grammar School was , across National s, Highers and Advance Highers. Out of those,  were downgraded by the SQA.At Stromness Academy, there was a total of  entries, and a reduction of  across National s, Highers and Advanced Highers. In total, around  estimates were raised by the SQA at both schools.With the small numbers at Junior High Schools, there were very few changes made by the SQA up or down on teacher estimates.Mr Swinney, who is now fighting to save his political career, has already conceded that they got it wrong, and said an independent review would take place to look at where lessons can be learned.The SQA will now reissue grades, based solely on teacher judgement. UCAS and other admission bodies will be informed of the new grades as soon as practical to allow for applications to college and university to be progressed.The headteachers of Stromness Academy and Kirkwall Grammar School, Jane Partridge and Don Hawkins both said they had full confidence in their teachers’ judgements to produce “well-considered” estimates.Mr Hawkins added: “The staff have gone above and beyond to ensure a considered and moderated set of results.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, teachers and other staff will have to maintain a distance from the children, while working hard to provide a safe and supportive learning environment.In a staggered approach, helmed by Orkney Islands Council, bairns have begun toto school, today, while pre-schools and nurseries are expected to resume, next week.As we caught up with some of the parents and pupils on this morning#s school route, #nervous but excited# was the phrase on most people#s lips. While children are happy to be reunited with their friends and teachers, and parents are pleased to see ato routine for their little ones, some admitted that they were just a peedie bit nervous about how it would all go.As Scotland remains in Phase Three of the lockdown exit route, the threat of coronavirus is still very much in the minds of us all. But OIC has assured parents that rigorous measures have been taken to help keep children and staff safe.The council has put together a Frequently Asked Questions list to help answer the common queries and concerns of parents and carers.

We had six quality swimmers ndash four of us can knock out kph ndash we were getting in, knocking our pan in, getting out to find we had only km done, and sometimes maybe sideways, he said.ldquoSwimming through the night can be traumatising ndash you just follow the light. Someone blew a whistle when there were jellyfish, and when you hear that whistle when you are in the water it is not nice, and that whistle didnrsquot stop right through the night.ldquoThe last two hours you really saw the whole boat, whole crew coming to le and roaring the swimmers in the water home. vw,vw,px, px\"Chris Judge touches land at Portpatrick in Scotland At , Mr Judge was the youngest in the team, and said he felt you need to be older to complete such challenging swims.ldquoI couldnrsquot have done these sorts of swims at a younger age. I think when you get a bit older you gain a bit of weight, which helps, but also you need a few things to have happened in your le, maybe bad things, to know how to dig in, he said.ldquoEighty per cent of it is mental, when you have went through a few things in your le, it definitely helps you in that channel.While most of the sea le they saw were jellyfish and seals, the North Channel swim saw a mother and infant dolphin join Mr Donnelly in the water. vw,vw,px, px\"The swimmers became the first to conquer the Oa Channel from Islay in Scotland to the Giantrsquos Causeway in Northern Ireland There are limited windows of opportunity each year to swim the North Channel when the water temperatures and weather are milder, and during a neap tide.Three people had attempted the swim by Wednesday but had not been successful, with five more to try in the coming weeks.Mr Mallon said several swims have been delayed until next year after the closing of pools due to the coronavirus pandemic interrupted training.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

After the devastation caused by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, , British and Commonwealth troops were posted to Japan to help support the US occupation and reconstruction effort.Among them was Tom Clarke from Ballymena and his daughter Sandra gave theaccess to her collection of photographs of her father and spoke about his memories to mark this sombre anniversary.Sandra, who lives in the village of Lundin Links on the coast of Fe, still keeps in contact with her old friends locally via social media.“Dad was born to Joseph and Jeannie Clarke nee woodcock at Clonavon Place. “He must have been a character in his earky years because he ran away to Belfast at  to try and join the RAF, but he said they gave him a good kick in the backside and and sent him home,” laughs Sandra.SELECTIONEventually Tom met the selection criteria and joined the RAF, subsequently being posted as groundcrew to the Far East where he served in Burma, India and Japan. “My dad was fiercely, proud of his time in RAF. He valued the comradeship and the friends he made during times of hardship far away from home. “I suppose that’s why he took so much interest in the Burma Star Association in later years. He could talk with people who’d been out in the South East Asia theatre and who had experienced similar things.”When Tom was quizzed by his prooud daughter about his role in the war he often preferred to joke about his experiences.“I asked my dad how many planes he had shot down but I remember him saying the closest he got to flying, was laying in bottom of flat bellied boat going into Hong Kong harbour! “Lots of servicemen ended up with bad illnesses out in the Far East and Dad was no exception.“I remember him telling me how he suddenly took sick in the street. He had to throw up and it was then that his  teeth came out and fell into the stream of filthy water which was running down the alley.“He had to chase after them and give them a rinse off - he was never going to get replacments in India during the war!” But it was in the immediate aftermath of the conflict that Tom became one of a very small number of British servicemen to be posted to the Japanese mainland to help with the clean-up of the devastated cities.With the prospect of terrible losses in any military invasion of Japan, the decision had been taken to unleash the Atomic Bombs in a bid to force the Japanese into surrender. The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August  and , , respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom. The two bombings killed between , and , people and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.Tom received a medal for working in the zones but rarely talked about the more distressing experiences. “He would just say that the whole city had been wiped out. He - and no-one  - had ever seen anthing like it,” says Sandra. “You can only imagine the kind of things he saw.”In later years, Sandra remembers her father’s breathing problems.“My dad was a chronic asthmatic and I remember, after he died, a woman came to see me. They were trying to seethere was any link about ex-servicemen with chest problems and whether it was related to working in areas,that were contaminated after the bomb.“My dad had his normal medals then years later he got the Southeast Asia Medal and I believe he was was the only member in Ireland to hold it“As a wee girl about , I can remember people in the house, were discussing what they would like to inherit.“I wanted my dad’s medals. He was very proud of me taking an interest so he made it his job looking to see any medals he should have had.

The UK has had a recession and Northern Ireland is in the same boat. UK Gross Domestic Productdeclined by .% from January to March. Normally that would have been a terrible result, but that was nothing compared to a further .% decline which followed from April to June. Total output in the UK economy in the second quarter was .% down on the end of . The UK#s Covid-related recession has been worse than that in France, Germany, Italy and the USA. Only Spain was slightly worse. A % GDP reduction would be the worst recession since , topping even the Great Depression of -. You have to go back to the calamitous years of - to find something comparable. None of this is a surprise given the extent to which lockdown shut down the economy whilst international travel was reduced to a trickle. Most service sectors experienced output declines of about one-fth in the first half of the year. The decline in retail was slightly worse than that. In tourism and catering the reduction was about %. For the glass half full person there are a few glimmers of hope in the data. Although unemployment continues to rise, in a technical sense recovery began back in May when GDP rose by about %. This was followed by a rebound of .% in June. The critical question is how long it will take us to get back to the pre-lockdown output level. This is highly uncertain given many imponderables: further spikes of the virus, when will a vaccine be available, what sort of trading relationship is the UK going to have with the EU from the start of , and what happens to the world economy. Some forecasters think it will take the UK economy four to five years to regain  levels. After the last recession in - the NI economy took at least seven years. It seems reasonable to allow for at least five years to get us back to where we were in December . The challenge for both the private sector and government is immense. Public health considerations notwithstanding, the Executive seems to have decided that fundamentally health needs wealth. They have lted lockdown more rapidly than their Scottish and Welsh counterparts. Lockdown#s achievement was fewer Covid fatalities and reduced strain on the NHS. On other hand, we can now see just how deep the lockdown recession will be. We really cannot afford another general lockdown which costs the economy billions and also reduces well-being in all sorts of ways. We do not know when a vaccine will be available but the priority must be alternative ways of containing a second wave such as test and trace, track and trace and very localised lockdowns. Here are some further policy suggestions: Foreign direct investment opportunities: as businesses source at home Invest NI could market the region as a safer location for GB foreign investment.Sectoral change: manufacturing could gain and the planning and rates system could be used to promote city centre living. Adapt to changing tourism patterns: opportunities could emerge for more staycations. Re-skilling during furlough: encourage more e-learning and take the opportunity to reform scrap the often ineffective Apprenticeship Levy. NI#s next Programme for Government could be simplied to prioritise productivity and competitiveness.

They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The fact he was man of the match in a dominant team tells enough about his performance. The finish for his goal combined power and accuracy to the bottom cover. With Ben McCarron playing further out, it was Logues running that made th Steelstown attack tick. MOMENT OF THE GAMEDUNNE SAVE – There were many scores in the game, but Marty Dunnes save was something . Dermot OKanes ball came in from the wing and Paul Rafferty just pulled on it along the ground and when the shot zipped off the turf, Dunne somehow got enough on the ball to prevent a goal that wouldve levelled the game in the thminute. TURNING POINTQUICK POINTS – While the first half goals gave Steelstown a , having Eoin Bradley lurking at full-forward meant they could not rest easy at the back. There were seven points between the teams with  minutes gone, but in the next five minutes Foley, McCarron, McDaid and McMonagle chipped in with scores to kill off the game.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has been developed as part of the UK Government’s Vaccine Taskforce, in partnership with the National Institute for Health Research , NHS Digital, and the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh Governments. Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, RD Division, Public Health Agency, said: “Health researchers are currently working to find a vaccine for COVID-, but without the help of members of the general public willing to participate in vaccine trials, this work will not be able to succeed. googletag.cmd.push “The NHS COVID- vaccine registry allows people to register their interest and be potentially contacted with an offer to participate in clinical studies. “You can sign up to give permission for researchers to contact you about taking part in COVID- vaccine studies.

This will help us to carry out studies and find a vaccine faster.” The registry is available to anyone aged  or over, living in the UK.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has four or five rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show. People like myself have tried to contact her to get something done about it and they just don’t reply. All talk and no substance,” said Phil Gordon. “When I got my first Leaf in , there were only about ,-odd cars in the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Now there are about , in the south and -, in the north. “The users are there, but bureaucracy and red tape has left it way down the list of priorities to get the network to a al level.” “They really would need to get their finger out,” added Ronan McElholm. “They certainly do need to get things moving with regards to legislation. The complete charge network needs and overhaul and massive funding. “As an electric car user, I’m prepare to pay for it like it is in the Republic. They’ve really started to upgrade the network there in the last few years, but you can see a big dference.” The UK government has committed to banning the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles from . The DfI have said they are engaging with the UK Office of Low Emission Vehiclesto ‘determine how to meet this challenge’.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has four or five rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show. People like myself have tried to contact her to get something done about it and they just don’t reply. All talk and no substance,” said Phil Gordon. “When I got my first Leaf in , there were only about ,-odd cars in the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Now there are about , in the south and -, in the north. “The users are there, but bureaucracy and red tape has left it way down the list of priorities to get the network to a al level.” “They really would need to get their finger out,” added Ronan McElholm. “They certainly do need to get things moving with regards to legislation. The complete charge network needs and overhaul and massive funding. “As an electric car user, I’m prepare to pay for it like it is in the Republic. They’ve really started to upgrade the network there in the last few years, but you can see a big dference.” The UK government has committed to banning the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles from . The DfI have said they are engaging with the UK Office of Low Emission Vehiclesto ‘determine how to meet this challenge’. A DfI spokesperson said: “The Department provides advice and guidance in relation to electric vehicles, working closely with OLEV. “The Department is working to identy actions to support the decarbonisation of transport including how best to support the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles to the Northern Ireland market. “The Minister has engaged with the DAERA Minister to begin working collaboratively to promote the use of electric vehicles and specically to improve the charge point network in Northern Ireland. “She is committed to exploring all options and new solutions to enhance the charge point infrastructure, improve lives and tackle the climate emergency. “The DfI continues to closely monitor funding opportunities for the installation of additional charge point infrastructure. “We will work with commercial providers to ensure that the installation of any additional charge point infrastructure remains fit for purpose commensurate with growth.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The poll, conducted before the NI Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face coverings compulsory from yesterday, indicated that .% would be in favour of the move. When askedthey would comply with a ruling to make face coverings in shops compulsory, the amount of positive responses increased to .%. % of respondents who listed Maghera as their nearest town or village indicated they would not complythe wearing of face coverings was made compulsory. googletag.cmd.push The survey also found that a large majority of residents in the county are already in possession of a face covering. .% of respondents indicated that they had either bought or been given a face covering since the beginning of the Covid- pandemic. Of that number, the most popular setting for wearing a face covering was the supermarket, with % of respondents indicating they had worn their covering there. Petrol stations and local shops were the next highest on .%, with hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons close behind on .%.  Just % said they had worn a covering on public transport, where they have been compulsory since July , while .% of those who took part in the survey said they never wore one. googletag.cmd.push Asked to comment on face coverings, many of those opposed to wearing one said they didn’t feel it would have any impact on the spread of the virus. One respondent said: “I really dont think they are necessary. Wearing them is not effective. Hand washing  social distancing are the best preventative measures. Others felt the issue should be a matter of personal choice, with one respondent stating, ‘it should be a choice, not an order’. “If it’s not safe enough to go out without a face mask then its not safe enough to go out period. The number of people with ill-fitting masks is unbelievable,” said another. “Gaping holes, noses uncovered, constantly adjusting them with their hands are all defeating the purpose of the masks.”  Protecting the vulnerable was a motivator for many of those who were in favour of mandatory face coverings. “We should protect each other as best we can. Currently the advice is that face masks help prevent the spread of Covid-, so take responsibility and wear one,” said one respondent. Some also felt that coverings should have been mandatory since the start of lockdown, while others who are shielding said the lack of face coverings makes them anxious. “I dont see enough people wearing them coming out of shielding myself,” said one respondent. “I feel really unsafe and anxious about going into enclosed places as it is with my mask on so when people are not wearing them it concerns me and my safety.” As the requirement came into force yesterday, the NI Executive launched their ‘Wear One For Everyone’ campaign, stressing the move was to make things safer for everyone.  A joint statement said: “The use of face coverings is a vital defence in our battle against Covid-. “This is about looking after each other and doing everything we can to stay on top of this virus. It will help to save lives. “It also has to be remembered that some people cannot wear face coverings, due to a disability or health condition. “There should be no stigma attached to anyone in these circumstances. If those of us who can cover up do so, then it will help keep everyone safe. “We are confident most people will comply, but those who do not wear a face covering without a reasonable excuse risk being issued with a fixed penalty notice by the police.” Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, said making face coverings mandatory was a positive step. “I welcome the move to make face coverings mandatory, and I think that we all should be doing whatever we can to minimise risks to ourselves and others,” she added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The poll, conducted before the NI Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face coverings compulsory from yesterday, indicated that .% would be in favour of the move. When askedthey would comply with a ruling to make face coverings in shops compulsory, the amount of positive responses increased to .%. % of respondents who listed Maghera as their nearest town or village indicated they would not complythe wearing of face coverings was made compulsory. googletag.cmd.push The survey also found that a large majority of residents in the county are already in possession of a face covering. .% of respondents indicated that they had either bought or been given a face covering since the beginning of the Covid- pandemic. Of that number, the most popular setting for wearing a face covering was the supermarket, with % of respondents indicating they had worn their covering there. Petrol stations and local shops were the next highest on .%, with hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons close behind on .%.  Just % said they had worn a covering on public transport, where they have been compulsory since July , while .% of those who took part in the survey said they never wore one. googletag.cmd.push Asked to comment on face coverings, many of those opposed to wearing one said they didn’t feel it would have any impact on the spread of the virus. One respondent said: “I really dont think they are necessary. Wearing them is not effective. Hand washing  social distancing are the best preventative measures. Others felt the issue should be a matter of personal choice, with one respondent stating, ‘it should be a choice, not an order’. “If it’s not safe enough to go out without a face mask then its not safe enough to go out period. The number of people with ill-fitting masks is unbelievable,” said another. “Gaping holes, noses uncovered, constantly adjusting them with their hands are all defeating the purpose of the masks.”  Protecting the vulnerable was a motivator for many of those who were in favour of mandatory face coverings. “We should protect each other as best we can. Currently the advice is that face masks help prevent the spread of Covid-, so take responsibility and wear one,” said one respondent. Some also felt that coverings should have been mandatory since the start of lockdown, while others who are shielding said the lack of face coverings makes them anxious. “I dont see enough people wearing them coming out of shielding myself,” said one respondent. “I feel really unsafe and anxious about going into enclosed places as it is with my mask on so when people are not wearing them it concerns me and my safety.” As the requirement came into force yesterday, the NI Executive launched their ‘Wear One For Everyone’ campaign, stressing the move was to make things safer for everyone.  A joint statement said: “The use of face coverings is a vital defence in our battle against Covid-. “This is about looking after each other and doing everything we can to stay on top of this virus. It will help to save lives. “It also has to be remembered that some people cannot wear face coverings, due to a disability or health condition. “There should be no stigma attached to anyone in these circumstances.

Despite limited loose surface experience in the  wheel drive Hyundai, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy are looking forward to seeing what they can do in Latvia. googletag.cmd.push “Obviously Italy was a disappointment but thankfully the car has been repaired. I need to put that behind me now”, Devine said. “I’ve only had a little bit of loose surface experience with the Hyundai so at the moment my preparation has been about watching onboards but we have the official test ahead of the event which will be a help. It’s going to be a bit of a challenge but we knew from the start of the year this would be the toughest event, just because it’s something we are not used to. Myself and Brian both did Finland a few years ago as part of the Junior World Rally Championship and it wouldn’t be too dissimilar, but that was in an R car, an R car is so much faster!

It was also interesting to run with a new team for that weekend which was a great experience and I’m very thankful to Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing for setting it up, he added. Callum and Brian will be partnered in Latvia by  other all Irish crews in Hyundai’s.

Rally Liepāja will begin on Friday, August  with pre-event practice and shakedown before the event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle  stages before a further  stages on Sunday conclude the event.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 5%2C 2000  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district.

Please try again later.Submitting...Catalina over Enniskillen during WWIIDuring the Second World War the people of Fermanagh became well accustomed to the sight and sound of Catalina flying boats operating out of Castle Archdale or Killadeas on anti-U-boat, convoy escort or training sorties. Ironically, prior to being handed over to the RAF, Killadeas had actually been constructed for, and commissioned by, the US Navy, but those plans changed. Catalinas, designed and built in the USA from the mid-s by the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation of San Diego for the US Navy initially, from  were supplied also to the United Kingdom where by the end of the war they had equipped a total of  squadrons of the Royal Air Force, at home and overseas. On Lough Erne, they were used by a total of six squadrons, not all of which were present at the same time.US Navy P- PoseidonAs a patrol bomber the Catalina was an effective machine with one outstanding capability – it could remain airborne for a day or morerequired, albeit at a comparatively slow patrol speed and with reduced war-load of bombs or the more usual depth charges, to conserve fuel. That did not necessarily obviate its effectiveness in the war against the U-boats as the mere presence of an aircraft was enough to compel U-boat commanders to submerge where the ability of their boats to intercept and attack vessels on the surface, which were usually faster, was greatly reduced. However, what it did mean in terms of U-boat sinkings was that Catalinas were not as successful as the Sunderland flying boats also based on the lough or, even more so, land-based aircraft such as the American B- Liberators. The precise circumstances of every U-boat loss will always be open to contention but records based on the latest scientic study would indicate that no U-boats were sunk by Catalinas operating from Lough Erne compared to five by Sunderlands. By comparison,  U-boats were destroyed by Liberators, albeit operating from three airfields in Northern Ireland , of which  were victims of Ballykelly-based Liberators.Nevertheless, two Catalina flying boats operating from Fermanagh, will long be associated with one of the most important early Allied successes in the Battle of the Atlantic – the destruction of the German battleship Bismarck. On May , the exact position of this greatly feared surface raider that was then the object of an extensive and urgent search following her destruction of HMS Hood, was established by Catalina AH ‘Z’ of  Squadron out of Castle Archdale. In command of the Catalina was Pilot Officer Dennis Briggs of the RAF but, signicantly, his co-pilot was a young United States Naval Ensign, Leonard B ‘Tuck’ Smith who was, in diplomatic terms, attached to RAF Coastal Command in an observation role but unofficially to help train RAF aircrew in the piloting of Catalinas as well as gain his own experience of operational flying as the USA was then nominally a neutral country. The Bismarck’s position established, her ‘shadowing’ was continued by a number of aircraft including Catalina AH of  Squadron, Castle Archdale , until her destruction the following day. In August , ironically,  Squadron was transferred to Iceland where it had better luck. On the th of the month, Flying Officer Jewiss and crew suddenly sighted U- on the surface and, in conjunction with the anti-submarine trawler HMS Vascama, sank the submarine with the loss of all hands.On Saturday, August , the th anniversary of VJ-Day, the historic events of early wartime in Fermanagh will be recalled when the US Navy will again make its presence felt over Enniskillen, depending, as always, on weather conditions.This will be in the form of what can be regarded as a ‘modern-day Catalina’, a P- Poseidon maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft except that it is a landplane, not a flying boat, with most performance capabilities signicantly dferent to the Catalina. A product of the Boeing Aircraft Corporation of Seattle in the US State of Washington, the P- is a military derivative of the Boeing  airliner. With a , nautical miles radius plus four hours on station and  knots top speed capability, it is equipped with state-of-the-art, highly sophisticated navigation, sensory and radar equipment. In a large weapons bay and on external hardpoints it can carry a wide range of armament including torpedoes, cruise missiles, bombs, depth charges and mines. Normally, it requires a crew of nine, similar to the Catalina.In , P- Poseidons entered front-line service with the US Navy which placed orders for more than . Very much smaller numbers are also serving with or on order for the RAF as well as the air forces of Australia, New Zealand, India and South Korea.The precise identity and base of origin of the particular aircraft expected on Saturday have yet to be revealed.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Victorious Japanese troops March Through the City Centre. Since Tommy Fisher passed away in  his family has cherished and treasured his memoir, recorded in conversations and written down in  by Helen Stuart , a family friend.Tommy died on August , , six months after his son Bertie, and two of Bertie’s children, Mark and Emma, were killed in a helicopter accident.Wednesday’s extracts from Mr Fisher’s memoir ended with the young RAF-man and his comrades ambushed on a train bound for an evacuation ship on the coast of Java.Some escaped, others were bayonetted to death by the Japanese, and some, including Tommy, were captured and ordered to lie in a rice field.Tommy Fisher in his First RAF Unorm.With no food and constantly guarded by a heavy machine gun they lay motionless all night, and the next day, and in a native shack for three more days, whilst some of the wounded died. Tommy buried his chum Micky Wilson “in a small grave in a corner of a rice field.” Finally they were given “a big flat pan and a bag of rice” by the Japanese, who showed Tommy how to cook. They were taken to Tjilatjap docks where “we worked long days and they treated us like slaves,” Tommy recounted in his memoir. Then to Bandong prison camp, where men were regularly “beaten up, some of them badly, often for very little reason…the Japanese very often just invented a reason.”Starvation was a constant torture.POWs were put in cages in blazing sunshine for three days at a time “or they made you dig a hole in the sand in which you were buried up to your neck with only your head exposed.”Some POWs were beheaded with swords.After three months in Bandong Tommy and about  POWs were shipped under horrendous conditions to Singapore’s notorious Changi prison campwhere “a lot of ill treatment and atrocities took place.” Three months later they were brutally crushed into a filthy, rat-infested ship for a three-week journey through a typhoon to Japan. The toilet was a bucket on a rope. The ship’s hatches were battened down ensuring the prisoners would go down with herthe vessel was attacked and sank, “It was three weeks of absolute hell,” said Tommy. Their first POW camp in Japan was Wakiyama on the south coast, scraping raw steel for building ships.Tommy ‘double-timed’ as cook.The camp toilet was a wooden plank with a hole in it “underneath which was a strategically placed bucket…the prisoners had to carry this to the garden to fertilise the vegetables.” The camp was “always plagued with diarrhoea or dysentery” said Tommy, and the POWs pushed their dead comrades to the crematorium in a wooden cart.The bathroomwas a tub about  feet square, filled with heated water once a fortnight.The POW’s menu was rice with occasional vegetable-tops and odd bits of fish.“We saw meat on only a couple of occasions,” Tommy recalled, explaining that the Japanese kept most of the POW’s fortnightly Red Cross parcels for themselves.After Wakiyama they were moved to Ikuno Camp to work in the copper mines in the mountains near Osaka. “Poor food, bullying and beating continued till the middle of August  when we began to be aware that something ‘big’ was happening on the outside,” Tommy recounted.Their Japanese guards became increasingly agitated by “vapour trails of American planes which had come over to bomb Japan.”And they could hear huge explosions in the distance.On August ,  a large American bomber roared up the valley.“As it flew over our camp it gave the ‘wings up’ salute” Tommy recounted.The bomber flew round again and dropped leaflets, oneexplained that the Japanese had surrendered, POWs would be released as soon as possible and food parcels would be dropped.Soon they were on the train to the coast and, well-washed “in great big baths”, they boarded ship to Manilla, via Hawaii to Vancouver, by train across Canada and by ship from Halax to Southampton.Tommy Fisher’s extraordinary wartime tale ended “all the boys from Eire were issued with civilian suits, and so we set off for home.”We don’t know what type of US Air Force bomber dropped the leaflet which Tommy kept, but as well as tomorrow’s VJ Day  commemorative flypast over Belfast by the RAF’s Red Arrows, a US Navy Boeing P- Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft is formally honouring local veterans with a flypast over Enniskillen at noon, subject to weather conditions.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since ing to site Farrans, the contractor in charge of the build, has ensured the contract is completed ready for opening in the Autumn.Farrans has been spearheading the build since initial enabling works got under way early in , creating  jobs on site during construction as part of a project which has delivered at least £. million in direct wages to the local economy.Located at the south side of Craigavon’s balancing lake, the facility is a landmark venue for the area and is situated within a pre-existing network of walking and cycling paths covering around three miles.

SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsPlan for  homes in Portadown gets green lightA controversial plan for a further  houses to be built near Lisnisky Lane, was approved at August’s meeting of Armagh, City Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s planning and regulatory services committee.By The NewsroomThursday, th August , : am\"\"The outline application lodged by agent Alan Patterson Design Ltd, on behalf of applicant Sustar Ltd will see approximately  dwellings and a crèche built on lands to the east of Bracken Lodge Lisnisky Road and Lisnisky Lane.The development of this . acres site will be delivered in phases, each of which will require further planning approval.There are also conditions attached to phases withplanning officers wanting to ensure plans for the proposed crèche are submitted and approved by the Council by the time the th dwelling is approved.The crèche must also be completed and operated prior to the occupation of the th house.This is to ensure that the community facility approved within the application is provided.One of the conditions attached to this approval will ensure a two lane approach to roundabout  is submitted to and approved in writing by the Council and this work shall be completed prior to the occupation of  households.The outline proposal also includes a new access point to these lands to be created approximately m south of No  Lisnisky Lane.The application has receiveda total of  letters of objection from four separatepostal addresses and one letter of support.Speaking against the proposal on Wednesday afternoon, Councillor Margaret Tinsley said she was not against the application for new housing but was very concerned about “traffic congestion in the area at peak times”.“Prior to COVID, traffic was queuedback from roundabout  to roundabout  already so how will these roads cope with potentially another , cars,” said the DUP representative.“Any improvement the Department for Infrastructureare to make to the roads need to be in place now, not when the houses are built.“I am not against these new homes totally I just want to ensure these traffic problems do not escalate further.”Speaking on behalf of the application, SDLP Councillor Joe Nelson reminded the committee the lands are already zoned for housing.“These proposals are for very high quality development, there will becrèche facilities on site and homeowners will be able to walk to local places of employment.“This fits in with the singular concept of Craigavon and will be a great boost to the local economy with development costs of over £ million.“I understand the concerns around traffic but I trust the DfI engineers have done their job and I commend the developer and the team working on this proposal as they have clearly worked hard to come up with this excellent proposal.”Ulster Unionist Councillor Sam Nicholson identied traffic congestion as the biggest bugbear with regards to this application and asked road service how they had got to the point where they are happy with the application.A member of Road Serviceinformed the committee that a transport assessment had been submitted as part of the application and was found to be acceptable.“A range of road improvements are being delivered with this application in a phased manner, including a link road to Old Lurgan Road and a two lane approach to roundabout ,” said the DfI representative.It was also revealed that traffic management modelling showed Craigavon’s roundabout’s worked in isolation but when joined together, the problems stemmed from the hospital roundabout junction.“This was passed on to my colleagues in development control and it was their decision to accept what was presented,” said another DfI representative.Following questioning about the condition of Lisnisky Lane from Councillor Peter Lavery, Council’s case officer in charge of the report advised this application was an outline application.“In future applications access will have to be considered and no development shall commence until work has been carried out at roundabout ,” said the case officer.“Proposals for a new access to the hospital have been submitted this week but that has to go through due process we can’t take for granted that will be approved when considering this application.”Alderman Sydney Anderson said he saw this development as an opportunity.“As the development is being built I would like to think Road Service would take on board the need to develop the road network as well,” said the DUP representative.Sinn Fein Councillor Paul Duffy describedthe area as “growing” while his party colleague Councillor Garath Keating said it was clear that traffic was a problem in the area but didn’t feel this was the developer’s fault.“I don’t think we can lay the blame for traffic problems on a new development,” said Cllr Keating.“If you are going to use traffic problems as a reason to refuse this application it would be very prejudicial on availabilityof new housing.”Councillor Peter Lavery said he was in agreement with this assessment but was mindful of the need to continue to monitor road use as the dferent phases of this application were submitted.Ulster Unionist Councillor Sam Nicholson said there was work to be done with this application.“The traffic problem is not a unique problem and I don’t think we can blame the developer for that, the onus is on the Department to future proof the road network,” said Councillor Nicholson.SDLP Councillor Mealla Campbell said she had been reassured by all she had heard and proposed accepting the outline application.This proposal was seconded by Councillor Paul Duffy and committee members voiced their agreement.Speaking on behalf of Sustar, development consultant Michael Hannath welcomed the positive decision for this application which he said will be very signicant for the local area. He said: “Demand for new homes in this location remains very healthy and our agents have already received direct expressions of interest from over  parties for future housing in the next phases since the first phase at Bracken Hall was completed.”Michael went on to point out that the application has already gone through a rigorous planning process and has been subject to a wider environmental impact assessment and subsequent comprehensive environmental statement. As part of that process, he said, there have been detailed traffic assessments carried out and important input from a multi-disciplinary team of competent experts led by planning consultants Oriel Planning. Detailed surveys and reports have been carried out in Traffic and Transport, Ecology, Hydrogeology, Geology and Soils, Drainage and Flood Risk, Noise and Vibration, Air Quality and Contaminated Land and Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment. In addition, community consultation events have taken place at which feedback has been received and taken on board. He said: “Some local residents have objected to the proposal because of concerns that they believe increased housing will add to an already congested stretch of road between the Lisnisky Lane roundabout and the hospital roundabout and heading into town. The main concerns appear to be around traffic congestion at peak am times particularly where we have the merging of traffic from the two-lane carriageway into a single lane coming from Craigavon direction and heading towards the hospital.”Michael pointed out: “Numerous consultations with Dfi roads over the past three years have informed the proposals and detailed design considerations have been integrated in order to address these concerns. The development team are confident that the development meets the design requirements and policy set out by Dfi Roads and this has been confirmed by Dfi roads in their final consultation responses. “The current proposal includes the widening of Lisnisky Lane at the approach to roundabout . There will be a flare lane added at the bottom of Lisnisky Lane for traffic turning left towards town which should reduce the traffic backing up in this area and permit traffic flow coming down Lisnisky Lane to go around the roundabout and head out of town.“In addition, the approval has a condition which requires the delivery of a second access to the lands before the occupation of the th house.“Sustar have been working with Dfi Roads and the Trust to assist with the delivery of a suitable option and a design for a new roundabout on Lisnisky Lane at the back entrance to hospital has now been finalised.“The developer has been working with Dfi roads and the Trust to facilitate the delivery of this for some time now and we understand a planning application is expected to be lodged imminently by the Trust. The proposed roundabout approved will provide a new well needed second access to the Hospital, a realignment of Lisnisky Lane heading to the old Lurgan Road and a connection into the development lands. This roundabout would greatly relieve the peak hour traffic congestion.”Michael was keen to point out that the positive economic impact of this development is “very signicant for the local economy. It will generate employment and jobs across a iety of disciplines, construction jobs, both skilled and unskilled as well as jobs in the materials supply and marketing sectors”. In total the development costs of this housing scheme are estimated to be in excess of £ million at present day costs “with a consequential inflow of benefits both financial and social into the local and wider economies”.
