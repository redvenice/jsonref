Win, lose or draw, Putin has guaranteed that the Cold War – a war that arguably he never stopped fighting – is back. His regime will likely decay into isolation, economic stagnation and political repression as a result.While our intelligence services and the military analyst community were warning of an imminent, full-scale war in Ukraine, Western Putin-watchers and Russians alike had their doubts. It just seemed too dangerous, disproportionate and self-destructive. On Sunday, just before the fateful meeting of Russia’s Security Council that showed the world how isolated Putin was, and how out of touch, a Moscow-based financial analyst messaged me that he was “feeling more comfortable now – Putin’s about to pull off the biggest bluff in history”.It was not a bluff, though, and the ambition of Putin’s gamble is becoming clear. His stated objectives – Ukraine’s “demilitarisation and de-Nazification” – suggest his goal is to install a puppet government that will ensure the country remains within Russia’s sphere of influence. The obscene suggestion that modern Ukraine needs “de-Nazification” is not only a desperate rhetorical flourish to convince the Russian people that this is in some ways a parallel to the “Great Patriotic War” – the Second World War – but also a prelude to the mass arrests and, Western intelligence agencies claim, even executions of those who would resist.Putin’s plan seems to rest on a naïve assumption that it is simply a matter of taking Kyiv and announcing a new government. In fact, that is the relatively easy part – any quisling administration will then need to be maintained by force against a Ukrainian population that shows no sign of being willing to accept it. Some will fight, something that is already clear as Ukraine’s government opens up its arsenals to distribute guns among volunteers. Even those not willing or able to fight, though, will resist in other ways, from sabotage to simple, mulish non-cooperation. As a British Ministry of Defence analyst put it to me: “This isn’t going to be Occupied France – it’ll be more like the partisan war Ukrainians fought against the Germans in the Second World War.”Hubris and paranoiaThat would be a galling parallel for the Kremlin, which has made a virtual secular state religion of the war. An equally instructive one would be the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Again, an ageing leadership in the Kremlin airily assumed that all it needed to do was take the capital and impose a new leader, make a brief show of force and withdraw, with the Afghans now cowed and obedient. Ten years and 15,000 Soviet deaths later, Moscow withdrew from a war it could not win. The generals had been well aware that the invasion would be a terrible and dangerous blunder, but the defence minister simply refused to convey his concerns to Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. We do not know what Sergei Shoigu, the current Russian defence minister, has been telling Putin, but judging by that Security Council meeting, this is not a president who welcomes or listens to naysaying.More significantly, while the Afghan War did not bring down the Soviet system itself, it magnified a series of debilitating trends that did. The economy was already grinding towards collapse, but Western sanctions worsened it by denying access to credits and technology. The people were already disgruntled and cynical, but as boys started coming home with broken minds or bodies, or not coming home at all, their resentment towards the Kremlin only grew. It is hard to believe that Putin is seriously thinking of this parallel, but we should, because, either way, his Russia is heading in the same direction as Brezhnev’s, driven by the same combination of hubris and paranoia.If, unlikely as it seems, Putin is able to take and hold Ukraine, even if only for a while, it will prove a Pyrrhic victory. The prospect might be that a triumphalist Russia will have pushed closer to Nato, have resisted Western pressure and be ready to unleash covert chaos on Europe if it continues to challenge the Kremlin’s claim to a sphere of influence. In the process, though, Putin will simply have re-booted the Cold War only to find himself losing it. Ukraine will be a turbulent, truculent conquest, and he cannot expect this to re-legitimise his regime like Crimea. There will be continued casualties, and it will further galvanise the West. Putin has been able to make political gains in the past by his willingness to go beyond the bounds of what we could call the etiquette of the global system. However, on every index of power – military, economic, soft, technological – Russia lags behind the West. Nato has twice as many troops as Russia (even if it is still in the process of reorienting from distant counterinsurgency operations back to mechanised European war). As we are seeing in the unfolding sanctions, the West has a massive economic preponderance. We also have other capacities that we really have not yet tapped, from cyber to cultural conflict. In the Cold War, we were willing to conduct political warfare against the Soviets and often got very good at it – these are skills we can quickly re-learn, if we are forced and willing to do so. The West is a giant that, having gorged itself on the presumed “peace idend” of the end of the Cold War, had settled down for a nap. It is beginning to awaken, thanks to Putin. Backed into a cornerIn this new Cold War, Putin’s Russia would have to cope with the three challenges of isolation, impoverishment and information. It would be treated as a pariah state, with all but a handful of partners of convenience. Of these, China would be the main one, but its relationship with Beijing would increasingly be that of client, not ally. Meanwhile, sanctions and a brain drain of the best and brightest would prevent Russia from dragging itself from its current economic stagnation. The current best-case scenario for its economy is that, by 2030, incomes are not any worse in real terms. Finally, given that even the Soviet state could not control the flow of information in the country, we should not expect today’s cynical and online Russians – they have the same level of internet use as in the UK, and many get their news from internet sources – to be any easier to dupe. Instead, Putin’s Russia would increasingly resemble the Soviet Union of the late Seventies and early Eighties, as an ageing elite presides over a country falling behind the rest of the world and a dissatisfied population is kept in line by police state methods. That led to the slow-motion car crash that Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms actually accelerated.Of course, it seems much more likely that Putin’s gamble will wholly or partly fail. Perhaps he will end up holding on to the Donbas region, because it is hard to see how he could walk away from the war altogether without something to show for it. In any case, he can hardly walk this back. This is his war. As Emily Ferris at the defence think tank RUSI notes: “He can\u0027t step back…  he can\u0027t leave the country in the state he has created, so all those discussions about succession plans for 2024 now seem defunct.”It seems hard to think of Putin re-inventing himself at the age of 69, after 20 years in power. That means no new ideas, no serious chances to improve relations with the West. Nor does it seem likely that Putin would now voluntarily leave the Kremlin, especially as constitutionally he can hang on until 2036. How can he leave office, when that would mean handing over his life, fate and fortune to someone else? Putin is not a man who trusts easily. How can he leave power, if not on a high? He is clearly consumed by thoughts of his legacy, and there must be the temptation to wait in the hope that an unexpected triumph is just around the corner. In other words, he has backed himself into a corner.And that’s a dangerous place to be. Some years back, a staffer from the Russian Presidential Administration recalled a story that Putin himself told about his childhood in the ruins of post-war Leningrad. He and his friends would hunt the rats plaguing their apartment building. Once, caught up in the chase of a particularly large one, he found he had backed it into a corner. It turned and leapt, and young Putin fled. The staffer’s conclusion was that Putin had learnt never to let people get into that situation: “You don’t chase, you take them out quickly.” It may well also be a cautionary tale for both his own people and the West. There is likely already disquiet among his senior officials, and especially among those now facing sanctions. It would take something catastrophic to make them act, though, given Putin’s control over the security apparatus and increasing intolerance of opposition. Likewise, there are limits as to how far into that corner we will want to push a man with nuclear weapons and a penchant for escalation. The tide is turning on Putin’s generationRealistically, just as in the last Cold War, our goal must be to contain, to undermine and to wait. Just as Russian troops and influence must be pushed out of Ukraine, Putin’s capacity to harm the West must be limited, which will require everything from more robust counterintelligence activity to reducing our dependence not just on Russian oil and gas but also other key resources such as titanium. Meanwhile, our old political warfare arsenal ought to be dusted off and updated for the information age. While some are talking of blanket visa bans and the like, instead let us make it easier for ordinary Russians to see what economically dynamic and politically free democracies are like. Let us make sure that truthful news continues to be available to undermine increasingly toxic state propaganda. Let us find new ways of throwing grit into the wheels of the defence-industrial complex, from cyberattacks to starving it of the best research. All of this will have its risks and costs, to be sure, but we have too long hoped to be able to guarantee security and stability in Europe on the cheap.And, finally, patience. Ultimately, it will be for the Russians to make their choices. Putin and his generation may stay in power for years to come, but the tide is against them.

Deaths were reported at 120, a fall of 17 per cent over the past seven days, while admissions have fallen by nine per cent to 1,169.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin forces will storm Kyiv tonight, warns Volodymyr Zelensky  US ‘looked on from a distance’ as Russia invaded Ukraine, says Volodymyr ZelenskyMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineVladimir Putin poised to unleash terrifying new weapon in battle for KyivUkrainian expat takes the long road from Basildon to Lviv to fight Russian invadersJournalist must name Birmingham pub bomb suspect who gave ‘full confession’, police tell courtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emerging pattern rewilding gardens set boost butterfly numbers","story":"Once upon a time, a perfectly manicured lawn was the aspiration for any diligent gardener.But growing numbers are now embracing rewilding by leaving parts of their garden for nature.A poll of over 2,000 people by BBC Gardeners\u0027 World Magazine found that 54 per cent of people had created an uncultivated area in their garden last year, up 11 per cent on the year before.Some 44 per cent of respondents also have a wildflower area, up by five per cent in the last two years.The survey also found that butterfly sightings in the UK decreased again in 2021, with peacock butterflies dropping by six per cent, and Painted Ladies down 10 per cent in one year.Sightings of Painted Lady butterflies have almost halved in the last two years, with only 16 per cent of respondents reporting having spotted one in their garden, down 10 per cent from 2020, and down from 31 per cent in 2019.Kate Bradbury, wildlife editor at the magazine, said gardeners keen to help boost butterflies could also resist the urge to clear up dead leaves or cut back dead stems from which chrysalides might be hanging.Letting grassy areas grow long and not cutting them back in winter also provides caterpillars with places to shelter, experts said.Lawns have come under criticism in recent years from eco-conscious gardening experts amid concern about their need for high levels of water in the summer and their poor provision of habitats for wildlife, which fares better in messier garden spaces.The trend has previously seen local authorities and public gardens leaving grassy areas to grow longer in order to provide a home for invertebrates and small mammals.Wildflowers can also provide year-round food for pollinators including butterflies and bees, which are struggling due to a lack of food.Previous studies, including the Big Butterfly Count carried out last summer by Butterfly Conservation, have also found a decline, with the charity recording the lowest numbers ever reported.On average each person participating counted nine butterflies or moths, down from 11 in 2020, and from 16 in 2019.Kevin Smith, BBC Gardeners’ World Magazine deputy editor, says: “It’s alarming to see numbers of our butterflies continuing to decline, as they\u0027re such a vital part of any healthy garden and, more widely, our ecosystem.We will try to raise much more awareness in what gardeners can do to attract butterflies into their garden, and hopefully see the population grow again.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin forces will storm Kyiv tonight, warns Volodymyr Zelensky  US ‘looked on from a distance’ as Russia invaded Ukraine, says Volodymyr ZelenskyMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineVladimir Putin poised to unleash terrifying new weapon in battle for KyivUkrainian expat takes the long road from Basildon to Lviv to fight Russian invadersJournalist must name Birmingham pub bomb suspect who gave ‘full confession’, police tell courtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"free world needs do defeat putins new russian imperium","story":"It’s surely only a matter of time before the disaster unfolds. The fall of Kyiv, which was almost unthinkable a month ago, looks a near certainty. The democratic world is reaping its reward from years of neglect and complacency.The call has gone up for sanctions on Russia and, despite some distasteful exceptions, the West is implementing what it can. Russia’s banks have been shut out of the global financial system by US and British measures. A move to kick them off Swift, the financial messaging system, is being held up by German worries over Russian retaliation. Overcoming Berlin’s objections would be an important sign of unity and purpose, but the truth is that most of the damage to Russia’s banks has already been done. It is impossible for them to trade normally.If the West and its allies are to win the contest with Russia, however, sanctions are just the start. Moscow will survive the sanctions easily in the short term, thanks to its huge resources and cash reserves. But while Vladimir Putin has signalled his intent to rebuild a Russian empire, he will not be able to do so straight away. There is time to stop him achieving his ultimate goal, even if we have been caught disastrously off guard so far. Firstly, Ukrainian fighters need support to stop Mr Putin getting comfortable in their country. This may well take the form of a long-term insurgency, requiring financing, equipment and intelligence from Nato. Two thirds of Russia’s ground forces are currently involved in the Ukraine invasion. If the occupation proves costly, in lives and military resources, it could bog down Moscow for years and make it impossible for Russia to consolidate its gains and move onto the next target. In turn, this paves the way for Ukraine to be liberated.It also buys time, sorely needed, for the West to shore up its defences. The last time the British army embarked upon a significant renewal of its equipment was in the 1990s, according to the former Army chief General Sir Richard Barrons – and the UK is one of Europe’s better military powers. Precision long-range missiles are essential, he says, but more broadly, it’s less about splurging billions on big-ticket hardware and more about building up forces capable of using cloud networks, artificial intelligence and ever-cheaper surveillance tools. This will take at least a couple of years.All of this is essential to avoid the nightmare scenario, which is that Mr Putin swallows Ukraine with ease and then decides to take a bite directly out of the territory of a Nato member state. At present, due to our totally inadequate preparations, the alliance would be left with a terrible choice between doing nothing and escalating into an all-out war between nuclear powers.To avoid this possibility, the West needs to start re-arming itself now and deploy sufficiently intimidating forces to the borders of Nato that Mr Putin thinks twice about messing with them. The 7,000 troops Joe Biden sent out this week are a nice symbol, but little more.Defence is only part of the equation, however. Europe’s Achilles’ heel is its dependence on Russia for gas and other resources, which gives Moscow the power to inflate prices on a whim, as it has this winter, and to terrify European governments. Talk of sanctioning these gas exports is completely unrealistic. Russia fills 30-40 per cent of Europe’s gas demand and it supplied gas throughout the Cold War. Without it, Europe freezes.It doesn’t have to be that way, however. If the West gets its act together, it can mitigate the problem, first for our gas supply and then for other critical resources like palladium.In gas markets, there are three levers to pull. The first is to remove the barriers to increasing domestic production. Britain has shown it can be done – despite being heavily depleted, North Sea production has increased significantly since 2012, when the government sat down with industry to make it happen. But financing to explore and develop new prospects is now impossible to come by, thanks to a thicket of planning and legal restrictions driven by a total neglect of energy security in favour of net zero. Across Europe, the situation is similar, especially in Italy, Greece and the Netherlands, all of which have under-exploited gas prospects. We don’t have to junk net zero to make this work either. We just need to displace Russian imports.Still, realistically, even in a best-case scenario, Europe’s own gas isn’t going to make a big enough dent in Gazprom’s supremacy. Pulling the next lever means getting suppliers, who are big enough, to ramp up their exports. Effectively, this means the US and Qatar. The US has to grapple with its own green lobby and industry incentives to make that happen. But Europe could likely lure Qatar into supplying more gas if it guaranteed long-term contracts to justify the upfront investment needed.This leaves the third lever: reducing Europe’s need for gas. The most obvious way to do that is through energy efficiency measures (if only Insulate Britain had picked the Russian Embassy as their target, they might have won public support) and increasing the use of renewables and nuclear. Britain’s renewables supply is currently near its limit given its unreliability, but most of Europe is far below that level. Wind and solar power are cheap and not difficult to install.Meanwhile, the huge gap left by wind-downs of European nuclear power programmes is just waiting to be filled by a government or alliance of governments willing to finance and bet big on it. As a start, it is madness to keep shutting down plants whose life could be reasonably extended, as is happening here and on the Continent.The West has dozens of factors in its favour. It has the technology, the capital and the raw power to defeat Mr Putin’s imperialist ambitions. But we have left ourselves vulnerable in the most basic ways, allowing weakness and dependency to erode all of Nato’s natural advantages. Sanctions are all well and good, but if we don’t address the deeper rot undermining our security, Ukraine will only be the first in a series of devastating surrenders.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin forces will storm Kyiv tonight, warns Volodymyr Zelensky  US ‘looked on from a distance’ as Russia invaded Ukraine, says Volodymyr ZelenskyMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineVladimir Putin poised to unleash terrifying new weapon in battle for KyivUkrainian expat takes the long road from Basildon to Lviv to fight Russian invadersJournalist must name Birmingham pub bomb suspect who gave ‘full confession’, police tell courtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"free worlds reaction vladimir putins aggression may determine","story":"So what should we do? The most important step is to signal to Beijing that we will not stand by in the event of an invasion of Taiwan. We should step up engagement with Taiwan now, to show we mean business. That includes high-level political, diplomatic and military visits to the island, to signal our solidarity and enhance our understanding of the situation. We should increase provision of arms, equipment and expertise to Taiwan, ensuring critical supplies are prepositioned. And we should promote Taiwan’s attendance at key multilateral organisations – or establish new ones that include Taiwan. Short of full diplomatic recognition – which would be unnecessarily provocative – we should do everything possible to signal to Beijing that Taiwan matters.Crucially, we must get more serious in the sanctions we impose on Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, and carry out a full assessment of what sanctions could be meaningfully applied to China if it seizes Taiwan. Sanctions on China are more likely to cause pain at home, given how integrated China is with the global economy, so a contingency plan should be developed to cope with the economic repercussions we may face. But we should be clear to Beijing what the costs of any invasion would be for them. We should conduct an audit of the assets of Chinese princelings in the West, and be ready to seize them at a moment’s notice. Benedict Rogers is co-founder and Chief Executive of Hong Kong Watch, deputy chair of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission and an advisor to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC).More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin forces will storm Kyiv tonight, warns Volodymyr Zelensky  US ‘looked on from a distance’ as Russia invaded Ukraine, says Volodymyr ZelenskyMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineVladimir Putin poised to unleash terrifying new weapon in battle for KyivUkrainian expat takes the long road from Basildon to Lviv to fight Russian invadersJournalist must name Birmingham pub bomb suspect who gave ‘full confession’, police tell courtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"housebuilders get cash incentive installing water saving devices","story":"Housebuilders are to be rewarded for installing low-flow showers and other technologies to help save water.Thames Water, which is in an area classed as under serious water stress, will give developers a discount on the costs of joining the sewage network if they commit to reducing water use in their properties.Developers are also being encouraged to retrofit existing homes in their portfolio as they build new ones to achieve “water neutrality”, meaning that the total demand for water in the area is the same after a new development goes up as it was beforehand.Housebuilders that commit to water neutrality will be paid more than £1,000 per property on any new development.They will receive smaller discounts by installing technology such as low-flow showers, which use less water and pressure, and systems that use “greywater” from basins, baths and washing machines to flush toilets and water gardens.The move comes as water companies face pressure over leaks in their systems and over river pollution, which they argue is exacerbated by the addition of new homes that can overwhelm existing sewage systems.Discounts for sustainable drainageThames Water will also offer discounts for homes built with sustainable drainage, which the Government is considering making a requirement for new developments.That could mean restrictions on non-permeable driveway paving, and more green spaces to allow water to soak into the ground rather than run off into the sewage system via drains.Thames Water believes that limiting water use and runoff could help to stop the outflow of sewage into rivers from its systems, which occurred for more than 200,000 hours in 2020.The Environment Agency has warned that parts of England could run out of water within 25 years as a result of growing demand from a rising population and the impacts of climate change, and has called for household water use to be cut by a third.It has also called for leaks on water companies’ networks to be cut by half. Thames Water is among the worst for leaks, losing around 25 per cent across its network.The South East is predicted to face shortfalls of up to 1.1 billion litres of water a day by 2040 if no action is taken to limit loss.The water industry is lobbying the Government for labelling on household appliances to show how much water they use, and new building regulations on new homes to help them use less water.Andrew Tucker, Thames Water’s head of demand management, said: “To keep taps running for future generations and to protect sensitive rivers and chalk streams, we need to reduce the amount of water we all use.“This includes us fixing more leaks, but also people using less water in their daily lives.”The Thames Water scheme was welcomed by the Home Builders Federation, which represents the biggest developers. “The approach by Thames seems a pragmatic and deliverable one that is in stark contrast to other areas where the result has been a moratorium on house building and demands that builders pay for solutions that are the responsibility of the water companies,” a spokesman said.“New builds are already more water efficient than existing homes and incentivising developers to go further will drive greater savings and, in turn, influence consumer expectations and behaviours.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin forces will storm Kyiv tonight, warns Volodymyr Zelensky  US ‘looked on from a distance’ as Russia invaded Ukraine, says Volodymyr ZelenskyMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineVladimir Putin poised to unleash terrifying new weapon in battle for KyivUkrainian expat takes the long road from Basildon to Lviv to fight Russian invadersJournalist must name Birmingham pub bomb suspect who gave ‘full confession’, police tell courtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"last keir starmer showing made","story":"Given the known hostility to Starmer’s leadership from that section of the party and their decades-long freedom to say exactly what they believed and to side with whoever they liked, it was unthinkable that they would cave to Starmer’s demands without an epic fight.And yet that’s exactly what they did. Within an hour of the whip’s ultimatum, all 11 had agreed to withdraw their names. However you look at this incident, it marked a remarkable victory for Starmer and his supporters over a group that has never reconciled itself to his leadership of their party, especially after the tenure of Corbyn, when it was the moderate majority that had most to complain about.Now, the rather obvious elephant in the sitting room is the fact that not one of those 11 MPs can reasonably be judged to have had a genuine change of heart over the role Nato plays, and Britain’s role in it. Their decision to withdraw their names was made entirely to enable them to maintain their membership of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and to allow them to be reselected as Labour candidate before the next election. No doubt this capitulation for self-interested reasons will produce the latest existential crisis on the British Left, with all the usual accusations of treachery and cowardice. Such is life in the Labour Party.The logic goes further: speaking publicly in support of Stop The War or in condemnation of Nato must surely mean suspension. And next time there need be no friendly phone call inviting the culprit to retract or face the consequences: the rules are now clear, the guidelines set. No Labour MP has the excuse of not knowing what the rules are.Could it be that Starmer now has within his grasp the kind of orderly, disciplined, functional parliamentary party of which his predecessors could only dream?

complains not told decided couldnt have security","story":"The Duke of Sussex has complained that he was not given the identities of those behind a decision to deny him police protection when he is in the UK, the High Court has heard.He is challenging the February 2020 decision of the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec) to withdraw the police protection that he and the Duchess of Sussex enjoyed as senior royals.He has taken legal action against the Government, arguing that the decision made by Ravec, which is comprised of representatives from the police, Home Office and Royal household, was wrong as “he falls within the immediate line of succession”.The Duke has also launched a libel action against the Mail on Sunday over its coverage of the case.At a preliminary hearing on Friday, Mr Justice Swift set out the four grounds that form the basis of the Duke’s legal challenge.They include the “over-rigid application” of Ravec policy and a “failure” to take into account “relevant considerations”.The Duke has also argued that the committee’s conclusions were “unreasonable” and that “insufficient information” was provided about Ravec policy “andor members or those involved in Ravec’s decision”.Shaheed Fatima QC, the Duke’s barrister, who was accompanied in court by the Sussexes’ solicitor, Jenny Afia, handed the judge two letters on the membership of Ravec.But she suggested they had struggled to ascertain who sits on the committee.Ms Fatima told the court they had “been asking about the membership, later adding that it was in relation to the relevance of the claimant\u0027s knowledge about who he was dealing with and in what capacity.The court heard that the Duke had been in correspondence with Sir Mark Sedwill, a senior civil servant who served as Cabinet Secretary from April 2018 until September 2020.“We now know that entity is a member of Ravec,” Ms Fatima said, referring to the Cabinet Office.The Duke is said to feel unable to return to the UK to see his family without police protection.He has argued that his private protection team in the US does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to the relevant UK intelligence that is needed to keep his family safe.He has insisted that he offered to pay for his own protection in January 2020 but that the offer was refused.However, Robert Palmer QC, for the Home Office, previously told the court that the offer of private funding was “irrelevant”.Mr Palmer said in written submissions: “Personal protective security by the police is not available on a privately financed basis.”The preliminary hearings, which were largely held in private, concerned an application by the Duke and the Home Office for some information contained in court documents to be kept private.Mr Justice Swift repeatedly rebuked Ms Fatima over her submissions, at one point telling her: “This is not a public inquiry into whether the committee reached the right decision or the wrong decision”, adding that it was a discussion about the legal merits of the case.The judge said he would hand down his ruling at a later date.Meanwhile, the Duke is embroiled in separate legal proceedings against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday.A libel action lodged on his behalf on Wednesday is understood to relate to a story that suggested he had tried to keep the legal fight over his police protection secret.He is also expected to argue that it was false and defamatory to allege that he lied about offering to pay personally for UK police protection for himself and his family in January 2020.The article claimed that the offer to pay was not made in the Duke’s initial “pre-action” letters to the Home Office, which it said suggested that he expected British taxpayers to cover

putin man behind iron curtain","story":"Of all the qualities required for being an effective spy, two surely sit right at the top of the deck: the ability to take on the appearance of whatever people want you to be and a talent for knowing when to keep schtum – especially on the subject of yourself.Vladimir Putin, it’s no surprise to learn, was an effective spy, even if he was known for taking risks. He grew up dreaming of working as a secret agent, was the son of a member of the secret police, and joined the KGB straight out of college. Over 16 years in the security service, he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.The nature of that start to life meant that eight years later, when the diminutive Putin was elected prime minister, then president, of the biggest country on the planet, nobody was quite sure who he was or where he had come from. Like any good agent, he could write his own backstory.  A quarter of a century on, time in which Putin has travelled from unknowable political fledgling to czarist global pariah, certain convenient aspects of his myth have become calcified, but the majority remains cloudy. More than any world leader, we still see only what he wants us to see.Here is a fact: Putin was born in Leningrad (now St Petersburg) in October 1952, five months before the death of Josef Stalin. After that things get trickier, as the primary source for most anecdotes is Putin himself. His grandfather, Spiridon Putin, was a cook for Lenin and Stalin, while his father, Vladimir Snr, served in the secret police during World War II. Once, his son said, Vladimir Snr escaped the Nazis by hiding underwater and breathing through a hollow reed, like James Bond.Putin’s father, a member of the Communist party, later became a factory worker. His mother, Maria, did various menial jobs. Young Vladimir (or Volodya, as his parents knew him) had two much older brothers who both died, one shortly after birth, the other in the Siege of Leningrad.Here is the first major question mark. In the early noughties, a Georgian woman, Vera Putina, claimed she was Putin’s real mother. Her story was vivid – involving an affair, an adoption and the nickname “Vova” – but the Kremlin strongly denied it. Two overseas journalists who were digging deeper died unexpectedly. By all accounts, including his own, Putin was a small and slight child, who grew up poor, with parents who worked most hours. He was spoilt and insolent. A primary school teacher remembered him as “not working to his full potential.”At home, the Putins\u0027 Soviet apartment block was infested with rats, which provided him with an education of sorts. In a quasi-autobiography, First Person: An Astonishingly Frank Self-Portrait, published when he emerged as a world leader, he wrote about driving one into a corner.“It had nowhere to run. Suddenly it lashed around and threw itself at me. I was surprised and frightened. Now the rat was chasing me. Luckily, I was a little faster and I managed to slam the door shut in its nose. There, on that stair landing, I got a quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word cornered.”Putin was an angry young man (he once recalled deliberately running a man over in a fit of road rage), and was picked on by bigger boys until he devoted himself to judo, which quickly became his favourite sport. In 1976, in what may have been his first media appearance, Leningrad’s evening paper celebrated 23-year-old “judoist Vladimir Putin”, who had won a competition. “Fifty years ago, the streets of Leningrad taught me one thing: If a fight’s inevitable, you must strike first,” he said in 2015. He now holds various martial arts black belts, and is never shy to take on an opponent for a photo opportunity.After a law degree, he was offered a job with the KGB in 1975, and began working in counter-intelligence, including in Dresden. A few years later, he met Lyudmila Aleksandrovna Ocheretnaya, an air stewardess, and married her in 1983.“I became friends with Lyuda, my future wife,” he once wrote, in what may be the least romantic passage ever penned. “I understood that if I didn’t marry for another two or three years, I would never marry. Though, of course, I had made a habit of leading a bachelor’s life. Lyudmila uprooted it.” They went on to have two daughters, Maria and Yekaterina, who – save for a few childhood snaps – were kept private until relatively recently. They reportedly attended a German-language school in Moscow and St Petersburg State University under assumed names, but have never been formally recognised as the president’s daughters. “I’m proud of them, they continue studying and they work,” he said in 2015. “My daughters speak fluently three European languages.” According to various news reports, Maria is now 36, a scientist, and married to a Dutchman. Yekaterina, now 35, was formerly an acrobatic rock n\u0027 roll dancer, but is now also a scientist. She is married to businessman Kirill Shamalov, the son of one of Putin\u0027s friends, and recently took part in a televised discussion in Russia. The appearance suggested she may be stepping out of the shadows, but there was still no mention of her unofficial father, despite a remarkably strong family resemblance.This is largely how Putin appears to conduct his private life: with fierce privacy, unless he can control it. When, in 2013, he eventually separated from Lyudmila after 30 year of marriage, the announcement was made via a suspectedly staged vox-pop after a ballet. “This is our joint decision,” Putin said. His wife, who had only truly served two years as an active first lady, joining him on overseas visits such as to meet the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, agreed. Putin continued: “We practically don’t see each other. Each one had his and her own life.” Lyudmila has reportedly since remarried Artur Ocheretny, who chairs The Centre for the Development of Inter-Personal Communications, a non-commercial foundation she helped set up.Since then, Putin has kept quiet about his romances. There is a rumour that he has a third daughter, Luiza Krivonogikh, with former cleaner Svetlana Krivonogikh. Luiza was an active figure on Instagram, exhibiting a plush international lifestyle, but suddenly stopped posting last October. Other lovechildren have been alleged but never confirmed.For the past decade, it has been reported that Putin is in a relationship with – and maybe even fathered children with – a former Olympic gymnast called Alina Kabeava. She recently made a rare TV appearance wearing a ring on the fourth finger of her right hand, as married Russians do, raising eyebrows across all 11 of the country\u0027s timezones.An Italian journalist once deigned to ask him about it. “I have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others’ lives,” Putin replied, stonily. The spy did not like being spied upon.Much else about his life before or since rising to be leader of Russia is a mystery, though we do get occasional glimpses. He has a sprawling property portfolio, including the $1.5 billion Black Sea estate dubbed Putin\u0027s Palace. Photographs published by Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation showed he has a marble swimming pool, a hookah lounge with a pole for dancing, a casino, a wine cellar, a theatre, and busts of the Greek gods. Then there are his superyachts, the latest of which is a £73 million, 240ft vessel called ‘Graceful’. This week, it was tracked leaving the shipyard in Hamburg where it was being refurbished, and arrived in Kaliningrad on Wednesday. The same day, a yacht owned by Putin’s old KGB friend, Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, was reportedly boarded by the Norwegian coastguard.Putin is a vain man, if the shirtless horse-riding photographs don’t make that clear. Inevitable ageing appeared to cease around 2010, when his somewhat goblin-like visage turned rigid and practically lunar. At the time, a joke did the rounds in Moscow: “In response to the charge that there are no new faces in Russian politics, Vladimir Putin got plastic surgery.”He supposedly rises late, takes a breakfast of an omelette or porridge with quail’s eggs, drinks coffee, works out, swims laps, then might dress in one of his bespoke Italian suits (Kiton and Brioni are favourite labels), before getting to work late in the afternoon. He then powers on through the night, and doesn’t drink alcohol.Taciturn to the West, partly due to a seemingly deliberate reluctance to use his competent grasp of English in public, he can occasionally come across as almost folksy to his people. He once spoke of loving the works of Ernest Hemingway and Jules Verne, as well as various Russian writers. He is also musical, to a point: at a charity event in St Petersburg in 2010, he both played the piano and sang Fats Domino’s Blueberry Hill before an audience that included a whooping Goldie Hawn, an admiring Gerard Depardieu, and an alarmed Kevin Costner. Putin barely smiled throughout.Generally, he projects strength, and only strength. The childhood myth he has woven is all about overcoming adversity and fighting to make it. As a politician, toughness and patriotism are all he wishes to be known for.He releases photographs of himself in nature, exploring Mother Russia, or playing ice hockey, or hunting. He walks with a KGB “gunslinger” stride – supposedly a hangover from Soviet training, one arm swings freely, the other rigid and close to where his sidearm would be. Enemies are punished, often theatrically.And none of this is accidental. In 2018, re-election posters bore the slogan: “Strong president, strong Russia.” Most politicians wish to be seen as firm, but they also want to be seen as human. To Putin, being human – being fallible – is a weakness, and “the weak are beaten.” He has written his backstory the question now is whether anybody can stop him.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin forces will storm Kyiv tonight, warns Volodymyr Zelensky  US ‘looked on from a distance’ as Russia invaded Ukraine, says Volodymyr ZelenskyMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineVladimir Putin poised to unleash terrifying new weapon in battle for KyivUkrainian expat takes the long road from Basildon to Lviv to fight Russian invadersJournalist must name Birmingham pub bomb suspect who gave ‘full confession’, police tell courtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz emily maitlis jon sopel leaving bbc","story":"In the week that saw Vladimir Putin officially declare a military offensive on Ukraine, The \u0027s news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to the headlines.Pupils could be banned from taking out student loans if they fail English and which other GCSE subject?Also this week, the National Portrait Gallery has ended its partnership of more than 30 years with which oil giant?If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters you will have come across all of the answers to the quiz.

The former Labour MP who famously once pretended to be a cat on Celebrity Big Brother has been forced to eat his words this week after he denied Russia was about to invade Ukraine.In a typically self-effacing tweet on February 14, he wrote: “Y’all said #Russia was about to invade #Ukraine. I told you it wasn’t. You were wrong. I was right. Again. Show some bloody humility. Especially if they’re not even paying you to act like an idiot.”Yet Gorgeous George, like his fellow Russia Today presenter Alex Salmond, has been paid to act like an idiot … by the Russians. About that show of humility? (Salmond has now “suspended” his show in the wake of the Ukrainian invasion.)Sadly, where idiots lead, other idiots follow. If the sight of Russian troops and hardware swarming across Ukraine wasn’t worrying enough, the invasion has unleashed that complete and not even useful idiot, Chris Williamson. The former Derby North MP and Corbynista, who was suspended from Labour in 2019, predictably joined the anti-Nato fray, tweeting, somewhat ironically: “How can anyone turn a blind eye to #Ukraine’s post-coup, neo-Nazi backed, corrupt regime routinely slaughtering people in the Donbas region for years on end, and then dismiss those who point out these inconvenient facts as Putin apologists?”Notwithstanding the fact that Volodymyr Zelensky, this Ukrainian president supposedly propped up by a “neo-Nazis backed, corrupt regime”, is actually a Jewish man whose native language is Russian, Williamson claims in his bio to be “focusing on building a grass-roots, anti-imperialist working class movement”. I wonder how that works in practice when you have spent recent years licking the boots of a billionaire kleptocrat warmonger?I’m all for discussing the role of the far-Right Azov battalion in the Ukrainian National Guard – but not with a bloke who thought Labour’s biggest problem under Jeremy Corbyn was that the party was “too apologetic” about anti-Semitism. Or someone who thinks they in any way represent anything other than a minority in the Ukrainian defence forces, or indeed, have a role in the country’s democratically elected government. Those who jumped on Putin’s “demilitarisation and de-Nazification” bandwagon appear to have conveniently forgotten that Ukraine lost millions of its own people in the Holocaust. Their memories also appear sketchy on Putin’s rise to power on the back of a war in Chechyna that killed upwards of 50,000 people, the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Skripals, the shooting down of MH17, killing 298 people, and the imprisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.Yet while the behaviour of deluded fringe players such as Galloway and Williamson may be as depressing as it is predictable, there is arguably something even more disturbing about mainstream Western thinking having also fallen victim to Putin’s propaganda.It was only a couple of weeks ago that we were subjected to the hypocritically pro-Russian bleatings of the very people who have spent the past six years arguing that Brexit was a result of Moscow interference.One wonders how the likes of those who sided with Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s “a---hole” of a foreign minister (George W Bush’s words, not mine), against our own Foreign Secretary Liz Truss now feel as the missiles rain down on the so-called “breadbasket of Europe”? For if the past 24 hours have taught us anything, it is that this misguided and unpatriotic sacrifice of our own democratic values on the altar of self-righteousness has been a gift to Putin’s murderous regime.As some quarters of the West have eaten itself over elections they didn’t agree with – be it the emergence of President Trump or Brexit – the likes of Russia and China, who have no respect for democracy whatsoever, have flourished. Imagine if, rather than spending the four years Trump was in office trying to impeach him, the Democrats had actually focused on cultivating a viable successor rather than a 79-year-old who struggles to finish his sentences? Imagine if, rather than spending the three years since Britain voted to leave the EU trying to force a second referendum, Brussels had put more energy into ensuring that Russia didn’t account for 40 per cent of its natural gas?Imagine if, rather than spending the seven years since he was elected virtue-signalling and manoeuvring at every turn, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had given some thought to trying to spread his brand of “progressiveness” to countries which don’t have the luxury of fighting culture wars because they have got psychopathic despots on their doorstep?Imagine if, rather than spending the past two years chasing the zero-Covid unicorn, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had put her self-styled credentials as the world’s most wonderful woman to good use by campaigning against the winter Olympics being hosted by a country that disappeared a female tennis player for claiming that she had been sexually assaulted by a senior Chinese politician? Instead, Ardern wished President Xi Jinping “every success” with the tournament, seemingly oblivious to the fact that one reason she has had to hermetically seal her entire island nation since 2020 is because of China’s shameful refusal to be honest with the rest of the world about what it knew, and when, about the virus.And to think these two socialists, who so regularly cold-shouldered “authoritarian” Trump, have now taken a page from the Putin playbook with their outrageous policing of wholly unnecessary coronavirus restrictions.The bleach-advocate is far from perfect, but frankly, the freezing of Canadian protesters’ bank accounts and the banning of pregnant women returning to New Zealand to give birth makes the Donald look positively saintly by comparison.Of course, it is all relative. I had hoped that the pandemic would wake the world up to what really matters in life and show the over-pampered liberal elite how truly absurd they are, when in fact it has only served to make them even more illiberal and intolerant than they were before.War, however, surely demands a recalibration of our culture of complete complacency. When democracy is threatened like this it serves as a reminder of the fundamental freedoms we hold so dear – the right to free elections, to a free press, to free speech.Yet instead of valuing the fact that we enjoy rights that others are denied, we have taken our freedom for granted and indulged in meaningless identity politics that have only served to polarise our communities and embolden our enemies.While we have been obsessing over fringe issues like the transgender debate and engaged in self-interested narcissism over what people should or shouldn’t be called, we have turned a blind eye to the atrocities carried out by the sorts of dictators who throw homosexuals off buildings. How insulting that Putin should even be referencing the Second World War when there is another genocide of the Uyghurs taking place right now in Xinjiang.If any good is to come of this horrific situation in Ukraine, it is surely the hope that the sight of mothers weeping over their children’s coffins might finally remind the so-called “civilised” world that there are more important things to worry about in life than pronouns.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin forces will storm Kyiv tonight, warns Volodymyr Zelensky  US ‘looked on from a distance’ as Russia invaded Ukraine, says Volodymyr ZelenskyMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineVladimir Putin poised to unleash terrifying new weapon in battle for KyivUkrainian expat takes the long road from Basildon to Lviv to fight Russian invadersJournalist must name Birmingham pub bomb suspect who gave ‘full confession’, police tell courtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"world pay price joe biden power","story":"Whatever Biden does – or doesn’t – do, the largest ground war in Europe since the Second World War is now unfolding on his watch, and the global post-Cold War security order could be rewritten.For the US, a Russian victory in Ukraine will force a foreign policy pivot back to Europe. At home, it could mean an uptick in Russian cyber attacks and election interference, along with increased energy prices, with inflation already soaring.There is a growing feeling that Biden is not the right person to lead the US, and the free world, safely to the other side.In a Gallup poll, only 36 per cent of Americans approved of his handling of the Ukraine crisis – and that poll was taken before Putin invaded.It is expected that Biden will benefit from a brief moment of unity as Americans “rally round the flag” in a time of crisis. Numerous senior Republicans said they were now “rooting” for Biden, and hoped he would succeed.Nikki Haley, the former US ambassador to the UN, says: “I don’t want to be partisan during a time when we could have, possibly, a world war”. But, during a Fox News interview, she could not contain her frustration at Biden’s reaction to the invasion. “Where was the action, where was the outrage, where was the whole idea we’re going to fight for freedom?” she asked.“We were desperate for a leadership moment, and Biden just didn’t give us that. I don’t think Putin initially thought he wanted to go to war, but I think Biden allowed the green light. We need to understand weakness got us to this situation. Strength is the only thing that’s going to get us out.”Haley is a possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, and other potential candidates echoed her sentiments. Whoever the nominee is will castigate Biden for allowing “war though weakness”.While previous presidents have been brought down by going to war, the final nail in Biden’s presidency will probably be that he failed to stop one.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin forces will storm Kyiv tonight, warns Volodymyr Zelensky  US ‘looked on from a distance’ as Russia invaded Ukraine, says Volodymyr ZelenskyMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineVladimir Putin poised to unleash terrifying new weapon in battle for KyivUkrainian expat takes the long road from Basildon to Lviv to fight Russian invadersJournalist must name Birmingham pub bomb suspect who gave ‘full confession’, police tell courtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer says russia must","story":"Keir Starmer says Russia must be isolated to tackle Vladimir Putins bandit ruleLabour leader Keir Starmer called for an end to the failed approach to dealing with President Vladimir Putins regime as Russia mounted a full invasion of Ukrainethis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video sir-keir-starmer-responds-russian-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:pJdmzu,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,mantisRecommender.hbEnabled:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Labour leader called for an end to the failed approach to dealing with Mr Putinaposs regime - and said the British people must prepare for economic pain.In a sombre televised address, Mr Starmer warned of the horrendous and tragic consequences of war for the Ukraine and said a violent elite had stolen the future of the Russian people. He said no one would choose to live under Mr Putinaposs bandit rule unless they are forced to at the barrel of a gun.His comments came as Boris Johnson condemned Russia for unleashing a tidal wave of violence against Ukraine, with bombs and missiles raining down on innocent civilians.Mr Johnson said a massive package of sanctions had been drawn up to hobble Russia aposs economy - after his previous package was branded not good enough - and vowed to reduce dependance on Russian oil and gas.He is expected to unveil a tougher round of sanctions in a statement to MPs later today.In a televised address, the Labour leader said: We must prepare ourselves for dficulties here.We will see economic pain as we free Europe from dependence on Russian gas and clean our institutions from money stolen from the Russian people. But the British public have always been willing to make sacrice to defend democracy on our continent and we will again. He called for an end to the failed approach towards Mr Putin, which he said fed the belief that the benefits of aggression outweigh the cost. Mr Starmer said the UK needed to help Ukraine defend itself and bolster its NATO allies in eastern Europe - and bring in the toughest possible sanctions against Moscow. He said: It must be isolated, its finances frozen, its ability tocrippled. The UK has for too long been a safe haven for dirty Russian money, he added.  Mr Starmer went on: This must be a turning point in our history. We must look back and say that this terrible day was actually when Putin doomed himself to defeat. He seeks ision, so we must stay united. He hopes for inaction, so we must take a stand. He believes that we are too corrupted to do the right thing, so we must prove him wrong. I believe we can, but onlywe stand together. His comments came as Russian forces mounted a pre-dawn assault on Ukraine from the north, the south and the east, mounting attacks by air, land and sea. Western officials believe Moscow intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so. They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban areas. It is unclear whether Mr Putin will seize the whole country - as Russian forces do not appear to be ready yet - or whether he intends to create a puppet regime in Kyiv.

The dramatic clampdown is the latest clash between the leader and left-wing activists and comes after Young Labouraposs Twitter account was restricted until further notice by party chiefs today. Posts said activists running the account for Young Labour, which is for members  and under, had been actively detrimental to the party’s core objectives: to promote Labour candidates and policies, and to win elections. It follows a series of bitter public rows, the latest of which saw the youth wing hit out at the defensive alliance Nato after Russia launched a brutal attack by land, sea and air in Ukraine - Labouraposs official policy is pro-Nato - and “offer solidarity with those organising against this, including members of Stop the War”.A Labour source told the Mirror: “Young Labour is supposed to be a place for younger members to get away from factional rubbish. Unfortunately not every one seems to understand that. Labour will no longer tolerate the selfishness of those who aren’t focused on winning the next election.”On Thursday, the leader threatened to remove the whip from  Labour MPs - including former Jeremy Corbyn frontbenchers Diane Abbott, Richard Burgon and John McDonnell - for supporting a Stop The War letter. Independent MP and former leader Mr Corbyn, who lost the Labour whip more than a year ago, was among the signatories. The statement questioned NATOaposs legitimacy and accused the defensive alliance of eastward expansion. It also claimed the UK Government of having no proposals for a diplomatic solution to the crisis and said Britain needs to change its policy, and start working for peace, not confrontation. All  MPs later withdrew their backing for the letter following contact with Labouraposs chief whip Sir Alan Campbell. Young Labour later lashed out at Sir Keir and declared its support for Stop The War and other pro-peace activists”. The Mirror has contacted Young Labouraposs chair for comment. Meanwhile, Momentum, which was set up initially to support Jeremy Corbynaposs leadership hit out at the silencing of the Young Labour Twitter account. A Momentum spokesman said: “We strongly condemn this shameful and anti-democratic attack on young members within Labour. This is a blatantly factional move designed to silence critics of Labour’s direction under Starmer, exploiting a moment of global crisis. It’s also a recipe for disaster, as Starmer is set to further alienate the younger voters who are a key pillar of Labour’s core support. Sadly, this Labour leadership appears so vindictive that it will willingly cut off its nose to spite its face.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON John McDonnellDiane AbbottJeremy CorbynLabour PartyNatoPoliticsKeir Starmer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Met is looking into  alleged gatherings held across Whitehall and Downing Street during lockdown rules under Operation Hillman.Mr Sunak previously confirmed he was at Boris Johnson ’s birthday do, held by No staff and the PM’s we Carrie on June , .But he insisted he had been present at the Cabinet Room for a routine meeting to discuss Covid.  Earlier this month, he appeared to suggest he was not expecting to receive a form to complete. Asked on Sky News earlier this monthhe expected to receive a form, he replied: No... well, I donapost know. He said at the time he did not believe he had broken any Covid rules. When previously asked about the allegations, Mr Sunak said he went to the Cabinet Room as he had for , , God knows how many other Covid meetings. Boris Johnson has already filled out the same questionnaire and police are considering whether to issue him a fixed penalty notice for breaking lockdown laws.

They added those accused can provide a written statement under caution - making Mr Johnson the first Prime Minister to face answering police questions in this way.Labouraposs deputy leader Angela Rayner said: This is an embarrassment that for the first time in UK history we have a PM interviewed under police caution.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CabinetLabour PartyScotland Yardpolitan PoliceBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Carer Jessica Hockings, , met -year-old Dermot Murray at work last February after heaposd had a fling with one of her friends. As the pair spent time together, taking late-night drives and walking Jessicaaposs dogs, they quickly fell for each other. By April, they were in an official relationship - but hid it from their loved ones at first for fear of judgement. However, the secret-keeping proved too much for Jessica who just wanted to hold Dermotaposs hand in public, and she soon announced the relationship. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Jessica from Mumby, Lincolnshire, said: I didnapost want to know [Dermot] at first. I donapost have a lot of trust in men so to me it was very daunting. But the lady I worked with on the evenings had a fling with him for a couple of months then as a group of three [we] became really close friends. Then me and Dermot went into our own little friendship world. She described how their relationship began to progress slowly. As the shts swapped over we used to have a cuddle and as it progressed I used to stay behind when everybody left and just spend time with him.  Weaposd then spend more time together when we used to go on late-night car drives, Jessica said. She added: It started off like a dad daughter relationship, it was a gradual transition from that to a romantic relationship. Although Jessica was initially apprehensive about the age gap, she no longer sees it as an issue and the pair have officially been together for  months. In fact, the -year age gap means Dermot is best friends with Jessicaaposs -year-old mum - and the pair even watch TV together when Jessica is at work. And their dference in age doesnapost make a dference to their sex le, which Jessica says is great. She said: We have a great sex le. Physically itaposs very good, heaposs gentle and always asksIaposm alright.  The pair are often mistaken for dad and daughter when theyaposre out but brush off the judgement. The last time I went to hospital someone asked aposoh is this your dad whoaposs brought you apos Iaposm like aposno itaposs my partnerapos, Jessica explained. It doesnapost bother us because we know that people might not understand. Family and friends have been very supportive, which I was surprised at. I think the only worry that there is is because weaposre in dferent letimes - when he retires Iaposll still be working. The pair have recently been shopping for engagement rings - although Dermot hasnapost officially popped the question yet. Still, Jessica is expecting a proposal from her beau soon - and sheaposs even had her ring finger inked with a heart tattoo with Dermotaposs initial.  When itaposs going to happen I donapost know but heaposs said itaposs definitely going to happen at some point, Jessica said. I got the tattoo because weaposll be getting engaged at some point and he means the world to me. She added: Iaposve never had a relationship where Iaposve been treated properly or loved like he does - itaposs all new to me. Itaposs just really nice because heaposs old-fashioned in the romance way and I love that. We used to write notes for each other, the odd gt now and then is really nice. Certain things he does for me now is just really sweet like heaposll run a bath for me, or make me a drink or dinner - stuff like that just means a lot to me. If he leaves for work early in the morning, which he sometimes does, he leaves a note for me on the bed or I leave him a note for when Iaposm at work. Jessica said sheaposs happier than ever with her relationship, despite the large age dference. Jessica said: Going out with an older man I find is so much better than [someone] my age because they have more le experience and heaposs just so mature and loving. To anyone who thinks  years is too big a dference, I would say as long as they treat you well the age shouldnapost matter.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Now, they are earning a fortune through OnlyFansCharlotte, , and Bear, , at their home in Gloucestershire Image: Reach CommissionedByDave BurkeSenior News Reporter:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsA couple whose businesses were decimated by Covid are jetting off for a new le in the sun after raking in thousands each month sharing X-rated videos online. Neighbours in their leafy Cotswolds village are oblivious to how the raunchy husband and we, who have five children, have turned their fortunes around.The pair, who go by the names Charlotte, , and Bear, , were forced to apply for Universal Credit after the salon and construction firm they ran were wiped out by the pandemic. Struggling to pay the bills, they decided to share videos of themselves having sex on subscriber  OnlyFans, and now have a lucrative army of subscribers.Charlotte and Bear now plan to move their family to Greece so they can continue their new occupation in the sunshine.  Charlotte told The Mirror: “We worked all our lives for our businesses, but then the pandemic came along and decimated them. “I had to make redundancies, it was awful. This is a lot more fun for us.” They now upload new videos and images every day and say they were pleased by the response, now making upwards of £, a month. In spite of their success, they said close friends and family were surprised by their new line of work. Charlotte, nicknamed Chots, said: “We were in a position where we applied for Universal Credit, but that’s a long wait when you’re not earning money. “We’ve always had an active sex le, and it’s something we started joking about. At first we thought we’d give it a whirl, it’s something we enjoy doing.” Their hundreds of subscribers may be familiar with them getting saucy in the bedroom, but Charlotte said her neighbours would be shocked. “We live in a quintessential English village, I think they’d have kittensthey knew,” she said. “They’d think ‘no way, they’re not like that, they’re really normal’. We’re quite homely people really.” The mum-of-five said at first it was nerve-wracking sharing their intimate moments with complete strangers, but described the response as “amazing”.  “There were mixed emotions, but people seem to like it, we don’t always take it too seriously and to be honest it’s quite fun,” she said. “We’ve now got lots of subscribers and we have to work hard to keep them. We’re turning it from being a side-hustle to making it a full-time job, we’ve got to put the effort in there.” Charlotte and Bear run two accounts on OnlyFans, with each having around  subscribers paying £. a month. On top of that, inidual users can ask them to make customised videos, for which they pay upwards of £ a minute. Although they’ve told some close friends and family members, most of those around them have no idea about their new income stream - and their children have no idea. “At first there was a bit of shock obviously, and there were a few questions about how it would work,” Charlotte said. “But they thought as long we’re not having complications or bringing in other people, which we’ll never do, it’s ok, they just tell us to stay safe.” But as it is a protected  with age verication, she said she is not worried about their kids stumbling on raunchy footage. “I don’t think it’s something we’ve got to have a discussion with them about,” she said. And she said it has brought the couple - who have known each other since they were teenagers growing up in the Cotswolds - even closer together. “We thought will it interfere with our marriage, but it hasn’t at all, we’ve found it’s a lot of fun.” On Monday they plan to leave the UK behind and jet off to a new le in Greece. “We’re embracing our next adventure, we love travel and prefer warm climates, and we can create content wherever we are. “We’re not making millions, butwe do get a new iant we’re lockdown proof and it’s something we enjoy.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveTeenagersDaily MirrorCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Katy Darelli, Deputy Manager at RSPCA Brent Knoll, said: This cute lad is an affectionate chap who sadly had a less than ideal relationship with his previous owner. There was a clear breakdown in communication between them and this resulted in confrontational misunderstandings. Buddy began to retaliate to these experiences at which point ownership was relinquished to us after a request for euthanasia was rejected by his vet. Buddy worked hard with behaviourists in Somerset to try and tackle his issues and identy triggers. He came on leaps and bounds, and the team discovered he had an obsession with squeaky balls and enjoyed eating from activity feeders.For more information about how the team are helping transform the lives of animals, and to find out how to adopt a rescue animal in need of a loving home, visit the RSPCA Brent Knoll website.

Oil prices typically quickly flow through to what drivers pay at the forecourt.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already warned that one of the risks of Putinaposs venture is that there could be a spike in... oil prices. However, there is no indication that people in the UK need to panic buy fuel. The nationwide average for unleaded is already a shade under £. a litre, and diesel above that. Experts warn petrol could hit £., over even more,oil keeps rising. This threat of a further increase in price has forced many into queuing at pumps, trying to get the cheapest price per litre in the chance it may rise more in the coming days.  Joe Michalczuk spotted long queues at his local Sainsburyaposs in Winchester today.They had staff directing traffic he told The Mirror.And the queue had built from pm to pm where it snaked around the majority of the car park.It was identical to the petrol panic. But rather smugly today, I have an electric car.According to HullLive, large queues have been spotted in Hull and parts of Lincolnshire.  Drivers were spotted waiting for longer periods to get their petrol at Morrisonaposs, Holderness Road, on Thursday afternoon.In London, one person wrote on Twitter: Long queues at every petrol station this lunchtime on the outskirts of London.Reminds me of the recent petrol crisis. Iaposm guessing many believe the war in Ukraine will increase the cost of petrol signicantly, so they are filling up their cars now   A picture was posted by another driver, who wrote: Queue at Costco for petrol half an hour ago… Looks like the conflict is gonna drive prices up.. I’d shop around.. PREMIUM diesel at Costco, £., at the BP garage near me, £., Morrisons are £. for standard diesel. One driver, who went to fill up at an Asda in Kingswood, said that the scene was “hectic”. People are being urged to consider ways in which they can use less fuel as prices rise, rather than engaging in panic-buying over the coming weeks.

There are now cross-party calls for a public inquiry and immediate compensation, as well as a medalNuclear test veterans who were told to watch atomic blasts have raised rates of multiple cancers Image: Getty ImagesBySusie Bonace:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Men ordered to take part in Cold War radiation experiments WERE more likely to die, according to a government study which has blown apart  years of official denials.Nuclear test veterans told to watch atomic blasts then live, eat, and drink amid the fallout have raised rates of multiple cancers, the research has found. They are nearly four times more likely to die from a bone marrow cancer seen in survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and more likely than other servicemen to take their own lives. The shocking research proves:HALF the crew of HMS Diana, ordered twice to sail through fallout in , died from tumours Atomic scientists were SEVEN times more likely to kill themselves RAF decontamination crews were FIVE times more likely to die from leukaemia There were more cancers than deaths, meaning some veterans have fought multiple malignanciesAnd despite Ministry of Defence claims servicemen were well-protected, three-quarters were not checked for radiation, while clean-up workers were both unmonitored, and more likely to die from blood cancer.  There are now cross-party calls for a public inquiry and immediate compensation, as well as a medal. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said: “This is all the evidence required to seek a formal inquiry into the issues and injustices that more than , veterans of nuclear testing have faced. It appears to be incontrovertible proof that their service led to serious health issues. “They need recognition and for the government to give them the respect owed to them by acknowledging what they have known for years: they paid a devastating price for their vital role in protecting our country. We are at a critical moment in this journey for justice and we need to see action now.”  His call for speed was echoed by Tory grandee Sir John Hayes, patron of the British Nuclear Test Veteran Association, who said: “There can be no doubt and no more excuses. Based on these facts, we need to act with no delay to recognise these exceptional veterans’ extraordinary sacrice.” More than , men, many on National Service, were ordered to take part in  nuclear weapons tests and  radioactive ‘minor trials’ in America, Australia and the South Pacic between  and . They later reported cancer, blood disease, miscarriages for their wives and  times the usual rate of birth defects in their children, but the MoD spent millions denying war pensions and compensation, insisting there was no proof.  The new research comes eight months before the th anniversary of Britain’s first nuclear test, Operation Hurricane, on October , . It was published without warning on the morning that Russia invaded Ukraine.It looked at causes of death among , veterans compared to a control group of servicemen who were not at the tests. It traced only  per cent, but found three per cent more veterans had died from cancer and two per cent more veterans died from other causes. Test veterans were  per cent more likely than controls to die from stomach cancer or pleural cancer,  per cent more likely to die from skin cancer, and  per cent more likely to die from acute lymphatic leukaemia. There were  per cent more deaths from suicide, and  per cent more deaths from chronic myeloid leukaemia. CML is caused by genetic mutations in the bone marrow. By-products of nuclear weapons, including plutonium- and strontium- are considered “bone-seeking” when absorbed by man, and it is known that they can damage DNA. Stuart Ross, whose dad Archie was a RAF corporal at Christmas Island in  and died in  from aggressive leukaemia, said it was time to released the veterans’ military medical records.  “My dad suffered for years with a layer of skin growing between his eyelid and eyeball, a daughter born with an outsized arm, and a grandson with Down’s syndrome. Then he died within six weeks of being diagnosed with blood cancer,” said Stuart, , of Hertford. “I’ve asked for the blood tests dad and many other veterans had taken when he was on the island, and officials tell me they don’t exist. They’re hidden somewhere. The Defence Secretary must order them to be released to the families. We deserve the truth.” The latest research studied an extra  years of data, and found higher rates for many types of death than were in three previous studies, first ordered by Margaret Thatcher in . The report’s authors at the UK Health Security Agency warned that the MoD could no longer rely on dodgy dose records from the s, saying that there should be no raised risk of death or cancerthe records “accurately reflect the broad levels of exposure”. They added that risks they found should be expected “, in fact, doses… had been much larger than recorded”. The Mirror has campaigned for justice for the test veterans since the s. A MoD spokesman said: As this latest report states, those who participated in the tests continue to show lower levels of mortality overall than expected from national rates, although this dference has narrowed with longer follow-up.We owe a debt of gratitude to everyone who participated in the British nuclear testing programme, they played a valuable role in developing a nuclear deterrent that has kept Britain safe for decades. We will publish a comprehensive response in due course. aposThis isnapost history, it is our daily livesapos Ken McGinley was sent to Christmas Island aged . He later became sterile and developed a rare blood cancer. He founded the BNTVA in , and has now been diagnosed with stage  lung cancer. He said: “This study is proof, but it isn’t the full picture. It doesn’t analyse the sterility, birth defects, or miscarriages, or the number of cancers some of us have had and survived.“It’s time for full disclosure - a public inquiry. This isn’t history, it is our daily lives, and the government must act now to deliver justice before that anniversary.”Ken, , of Paisley, added: “I was treated like an enemy of the state. I wasn’t given my blood cancer diagnosis although it was in my notes, my benefits were stopped, and when my we Alice and I were trying for children, a note was added to our file that the doctors would be ‘very interested in the outcome of any pregnancy ’.”aposTragedy took over mumaposs leapos After The Mirror called for a medal, then-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson met campaigners in . Widow Shirley Denson, whose husband Eric was an RAF pilot ordered to fly through a mushroom cloud in , walked into the room and said: “So, you’re the man responsible for killing my husband.”Shirley, of Morden, Surrey, had uncovered documents proving Eric was used in an experiment on his plane, and had the equivalent of , X-rays to his brain in just six minutes. He later took his own le after two decades of crippling headaches, saying he couldn’t stand it any more. A third of his descendants have birth defects, including missing and extra teeth.Mr Williamson was so impressed by her that he ordered fresh research. Shirley died before it could be published, in March last year, with the MoD refusing her deathbed plea for a medal. Daughter Shelley, , said: “My mum was a formidable woman. She raised four daughters, and had to deal with the tragedy not just of my dad’s suicide, but his illness in the years before it. It took over her le. “This study proves what she always said, when the government claimed there was no evidence - we ARE the evidence. All those young men who were sent to their deaths, just married, with children on the way or yet to come, and then left to rot. “I hope now that the veterans and their families finally get everything they deserve. It would be an awesome legacy for my mum. She fought so valiantly, and it broke her heart that there was no justice for her girls.”  Exposure risks Test veterans had higher death rates than the controls of cerebrovascular disease, respiratory and circulatory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and were more likely to die from accidents, violence, and intentional self-harm.In the first  years after the blasts, test survivors had a , per cent high risk of developing multiple myeloma, a  per cent higher risk of liver cancer, and were eight times more likely to get leukaemia. Even  years later, test veterans are still up to . times more likely to get leukaemia. The study also found evidence that may point to the psychological harm caused by the tests and subsequent official denials, with high rates of mouth cancer and cirrhosis among test veterans which, researchers said, “may indicate that alcohol use in certain subgroups of veterans was somewhat higher than in the general population”.It found increased risk of suicide for test veterans compared to the control group for every decade since the trials. “The highest rates of intentional self-harm were seen in the first  years of follow-up,” they said. Veterans later identied as being at most risk of radiation exposure had a  per cent higher risk of dying from suicide. aposUnacceptably radioactiveapos In , on the eve of a High Court case, the MoD admitted some servicemen were more likely to have been exposed to radiation. Researchers found these groups had a higher risk of stroke, which has also been noted in Japanese A-bomb survivors, and prostate cancer. On HMS Diana,  per cent of the  crew have died. Most were due to tumours, and  per cent of the crew had malignancies. More than a tenth had prostate cancer,  per cent had circulatory disease, and  per cent had ischaemic heart disease which has been linked to radiation. The captain later reported the ship was “unacceptably radioactive”, but the crew remained on board for another year. Operation Buffalo took place in Australia and  and included an “indoctrinee force” ordered to walk, crawl and run through fallout to see how much stayed on their unorms. Some were ordered to sit in tanks close to the blast to test the effect on men and machinery. The study found all of them had a radiation dose,  per cent were dead, more than a quarter died from cancer, and they had double the risk of dying from leukaemia and unspecied tumours.  RAF ground crew decontaminating planes which had flown sampling missions through the mushroom clouds were  times more likely than controls to die from leukaemia, and had raised rates of prostate cancer, and diseases of the heart and lungs. More than  per cent had a recorded radiation dose. Half of the air crew who flew the “snf” planes are dead, and  per cent had a recorded dose. They had double the controls’ rate of lung and blood cancer, and were almost four times more likely to die from unspecied growths. They also had seriously-raised risks of heart and lung disease, and deaths from accidents or violence. Men who took part in the minor trials, and Operation Dominic where UK servicemen witnessed multiple US bomb tests, had increased rates of almost every cancer and non-cancer disease that was studied.

The -year-old has applied for a judicial review of a decision not to allow him to personally pay for police protection for himself and his family when they are in the UKThe Duke of Sussex received insufficient information over a decision to change his tax-payer funded police protection when he is in the UK, the High Court has heard. Harry was told he would no longer be given the same degree of personal protective security when visiting from the US - despite offering to pay for it himself.He is taking on the Home Office because he wants to bring his children and we to visit from across the Atlantic. But Harry “does not feel safe” when visiting under the current security arrangements, the court was previously told. He is challenging the February  decision of the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures , which has delegated powers from the Home Secretary. Harry is arguing that his private protection team in the US does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information which is needed to keep his family safe.On Friday, the first hearing in the case continued at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, at which Harry was not present. The preliminary proceedings, which were largely held in private, related to an application by the Duke and the Home Office for some parts of court documents in the case to be kept private.  During an initial public part of Friday’s hearing, the judge, Mr Justice Swt, summarised the four grounds forming the basis of the duke’s legal challenge. He said these included an alleged “over rigid application of the policy” and a “failure” to take into account “relevant considerations”. The grounds also claim that conclusions reached were “unreasonable” and that “insufficient information” was provided in relation to the Ravec policy and “those involved in the Ravec decision”, the judge said. During the hearing, Shaheed Fatima QC, representing the duke, provided the judge with two letters “on the membership of Ravec”. She told court that “we’ve been asking about the membership”, later adding that this would relate to “the relevance of the claimant’s knowledge about who he was dealing with and in what capacity”.  Ms Fatima told the court that “we now know” that the Cabinet Office as an “entity” is a member of Ravec. She also told the judge that the duke previously had “correspondence” with Sir Mark Sedwill, a senior civil servant who served as Cabinet Secretary from April  to September . At the first part of the hearing held last week, the court heard that the duke considers that the UK “is and always will be, his home”. Ms Fatima told the court: “It goes without saying that he does want to come back to see family and friends and to continue to support the charities that are so close to his heart.” A legal representative for Harry previously said the duke wants to fund the security himself, rather than ask taxpayers to foot the bill. In written submissions, Robert Palmer QC, for the Home Office, argued that the duke’s offer to pay for his own security was “irrelevant” and that “personal protective security by the police is not available on a privately financed basis”. He said Ravec had attributed to the duke “a form of exceptional status” where he is considered for personal protective security by the police “with the precise arrangements being dependent on the reason for his presence in Great Britain and by reference to the s he carries out when present”. The barrister added: “A case-by-case approach rationally and appropriately allows Ravec to implement a responsive approach to reflect the applicable circumstances.” The Home Office’s written arguments also claim that Harry’s offer of funding was “notably not advanced to Ravec” at the time of the duke’s visit in June , or in any pre-action discussions. The duke briefly ed from Los Angeles last year for the July  unveiling of the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial statue and, the day before, on June , he met seriously ill children and young people at a WellChild garden party and afternoon tea in Kew Gardens, west London. It is understood the duke’s car was chased by photographers as he left. The duke and his we Meghan now live in the United States with their children Archie and Lilibet after quitting as senior working royals in early . Mr Justice Swt is expected to give his ruling on the initial court proceedings, part of which may be confidential, at a later date.

Tash Donald said a test then found drug traces similar to “roofies”, a date rape drug, in her system, after she reported the incident to police.The -year-old says she remembers starting to feel “strange” during a night out with friends at the Slug and Lettuce restaurant in Solihull, Birmingham on Friday, February . Psychology student Tash said her instincts kicked in after she started to feel unwell. She said she remembers nothing after heading into the girlaposs toilets at around .pm until she woke up the next day in hospital. Tash, from Olton in Solihull, then found out from family that she had asked her sister to pick her up, been repeatedly sick in the car and then fallen unconscious in her front garden, Birmingham Live reports. Can more be done to stop spiking  Have your say in the comment sectionBut it wasnapost until five days later, after reporting what happened to police, that Tash said a test discovered a drug similar to aposroofiesapos in her system. It was really terrying to find that out, said Tash, a student at the University of Birmingham.In some ways, I am lucky because my instincts kicked in to get out of there. If I hadnapost, I donapost know what could have happened. I just remember going into the toilets because I felt a bit strange and texting my sister saying I didnapost feel right. I think Iaposd had four or five drinks by that point which might sound a lot, but I do go out quite a lot and I knew how I felt wasnapost right for me. After that, I donapost remember anything. I only know what happened from what my family told me.  Apparently my sister rang me and said I didnapost sound right, she just thought I sounded very drunk at first. I donapost know how I got from the toilets to her car because none of my friends saw me but I obviously managed to get there somehow. While she was driving me home, she was having to hold me up because I completely lost control of my body. I was limp and nearly unconscious and was being sick over and over again. She rang my mum and said she thought Iaposd been spiked. By the time she got me home, I was unconscious. They rang an ambulance purely because they didnapost know what to do, they were really worried. The ambulance crew had to put me on the grass in the recovery position outside my house.  Tash was taken to hospital where she stayed under observation overnight. She woke up around .am the next morning feeling dazed and confused. I felt so confused, I couldnapost even remember my birthday when the nurse asked, said Tash. For a few days after, I just felt very tired. I was very zoned out, it was like brain fog. Suspecting she had been spiked, Tash reported the incident to police. She says the results of a drug test then came back positive for a sedative similar to Rohypnol, also known as aposroofiesapos.The part-time sales assistant has since taken to Instagram to share her story. Sheaposs hoping to raise awareness of the symptoms of spiking and has been overwhelmed by the response. Get the news you want straight to your inbox every day.to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters here I wanted to share my experience because I know a lot of people in my situation donapost report things, she said. From that post, I had five or six other girls message me to say they had been through a similar experience. The majority of them said they had never reported it as they assumed the police wouldnapost do anything, but from my experience the police have taken it really seriously. Theyaposre looking at CCTV and are doing an investigation. I would say Iaposm quite vigilant but there could have been a moment when I had my drink in my hand and wasnapost watching it, itaposs hard to say. I want to make other girls aware of the signs so they can look out for themselves and their friends. West Midlands Police confirmed it is investigating the incident and Slug and Lettuce told BirminghamLive it is assisting police with their enquiries.A police spokesperson said: Weaposre investigating a report of womanaposs drink being spiked on a night out in Solihull on Friday, February . She was taken to hospital after becoming unwell. A spokesperson for Slug and Lettuce Solihull added: “The safety and well-being of our guests is our main priority.

We didn’t think anything of it for a while,” she wrote in the comments. Her video of the cameras found in her Airbnb room, which appears to be in the city of Austin, Texas has been viewed more than , times since Monday. She said her original video was deleted so she posted it again.“It’s a felony in Texas. And against Airbnb’s policy. It’s on their website of what they do and don’t allow in regard to cameras,” wrote Ms Walsh. She also said: “I assume the owners would be smart enough to hide it better.

The first video should be the person who originally plugged it in.” While others offered handy tips on how to spot hotels or holiday accomodation for hidden cameras. One wrote: “A big one is smoke alarms too. Most good cameras you would never find though. There are apps that can scan the Wi-Fi for devices that are cameras.” Another said: “Always turn all lights off and record with no flash on your phone everywhere in every room. If you see a flashing light it’s most likely a camera.” It said: Airbnb strictly prohibits aposhidden camerasapos as well as recording devices of any kind in private spaces such as bathrooms and bedrooms.

After all, youaposre never going to feel like your most attractive selfyouaposre constantly aware of your knickers being too loose or too tight. In a recent picture uploaded to the Instagram account for Asdaaposs clothing range, George at Asda, plus-size model Olivia Campbell could be seen advertising the supermarket giantaposs pink and green lace sets. The non-padded lace bras are currently being sold in a two-pack online for £ and come in ious sizes. The model looked beautul in the snaps, however, as previously reported byManchester Evening News,a number of shoppers feel that the set is poorly fitted, and doesnapost do Olivia justice.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The post in question, captioned Gorgeous gorgeous girls, wear basics that make them feel amazing, features two pictures of Olivia, who can be seen beaming ear-to-ear. However, not all followers were quite so pleased with the post. One person wrote: It would be helpfulthey were properly fitting items. I’m all for curvy models and she’s gorgeous but those pieces do not fit her properly. A second commented: Listen, George... Iaposm that girlaposs size, sheaposs beautul and deserves more respect than to be made to wear panties that would slice your hoohar into two! I would not be comfortable in those and I would not feel sexy!Meanwhile, a third person remarked that, although it was brilliant that the supermarket is using plus size models, they should at least dress them in clothes that fit., adding that bra is such a bad fit and as for those knickers...cheese wire springs to mind. However, others took issue with the criticism, with another shopper remarking: The knickers fit... this is just what our fat bodies look like when we wear high leg knickers the same way everyone  does on social media. They added that the negativity in the comment section shows exactly why we need to normalise fat bodies by increasing representation everywhere. Olivia herself appeared quite happy with the undies, sharing the photos on her own Instagram account while declaring: I am feeling fabulous today! George at ASDA have released three empower poses. And I was the lucky babe that got to try on all their lovely lingerie and show you my favourite, which is the Flamingo pose. Now I feel like the ultimate boss babe. In a statement given to the Manchester Evening News, an ASDA spokesperson said: “The new George lingerie campaign highlights a positive message around both ersity and inclusion.

The loud bang like an explosion happened after Malcolm Nicholson had settled down to watch a rugby international.He first though something had happened to his French doors due because of strong winds outside, the Daily Record reports.But he found his table was completely wrecked and glass covered his dining area.The -year-old firefighter and his son, , were sitting next to the explosion.Malcom and his we Joan, , contacted DFS immediately who told him they were looking into the matter. But the couple, from Skelmorlie, North Ayrshire, were furious when furniture firm DFS claimed the manufacturers were taking no responsibility for the incident.What do you make of the footage  Have your say in the comment section Malcolm, who shelled out more than £ on the table just  months ago, fears for other customers who bought the item and further damage which could be done. The dad-of-one said: I was watching Ireland v Wales in the Six Nations just along from our dining table, in the living room. All of a sudden we heard this loud bang, just like an explosion. When I realised it was the table I was stunned, there was glass everywhere. Video footage shows the extent of the damage. The entire glass top of the table is destroyed with the carpet blanketed with shards of glass.Get the news you want straight to your inbox every day.to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters here Shelves of the adjacent unit are covered in glass too, as well as the arm of a swivel chair shown in the images - which is where Malcomaposs son was seated. Malcolm added: I sat at the table earlier to do a bit of work on the laptop but that was it. Nothing was on it other than a note pad and a pen. We bought it in late  and have had no issues with it before. We keep it clean so would knowthere were any cracks. The item was part of a costly DFS haul for the Nicholsons who renovated their living and dining areas in  spending between £, and £, on a couch and some units. DFS manufacturers taking no responsibility for this is just staggering, Malcom said. To think how much money we spent on DFS just over a year ago and now weaposre left with nothing. This could have been so much worse, people could own this table and have babies or pets at home. My son was sat really close, glass could have gone in this eye. Weaposre really disappointed.

The team were trying to speak with a ghost named George, which they believed to be a soldier who fought during the English civil war in the s.

He said: My does isnapost allowed even temporarily on the bed anymore, andmy girlfriend is on the sofa, the dog is forbidden to be on it. My girlfriend doesnapost like to be touched or cuddled with, eventhe dog is just chilling next to her and not bothering her, she has to be on the floor.Denying it has anything to do with dog hair, allergies or a traumatic previous experience, the man says he just doesnapost understand his girlfriendaposs sudden change in attitude towards his dog. My dog is well-behaved and the best pal I could ask for, he said. She is toilet trained, never destroys things and loves to sleep in her crate without issue. I was raised around four or five dogs at a time just never had my own in my own house until now. She is the first dog who is actually mine.  Having dreamt about spending a lazy Saturday afternoon watching a movie with his girlfriend and dog on the sofa, the man has questioned how he can get his partner to warm up to the idea. He added: Itaposs a simple harmless joy that is really selfishly important to me. They are my family and it is the best feeling in the world to me. However, my girlfriend wonapost allow this. Ever. Never ever. Forbidden. The man has tried to explain to his girlfriend how he feels about this issue - but says their chats soon turns into a heated argument. If the dog is cuddling with me on the couch watching a show on TV, my girlfriend leaves the room or it becomes an argument and I lose my s*** because I feel like this is such a trivial pathetic issue, he said.The dog does not get crazy, and will relaxwe tell her not to climb as all dogs might try at first - but she causes no harm and just chills. She wants to be part of the family. My girlfriend says aposShe can be part of it on the floorapos. She has no rationale or credible argument for why. She denies jealousy but I think itaposs a bit jealous and selfish on her behalf knowing full well itaposs a simple request of mine and that Iaposve compromised with never having the dog ever on the bed again. Why canapost the dog just cuddle with us one in a while on a lazy day watching a movie on the sofa. Making matter worse, the man explained how his girlfriend has worked as a dog bather for years, claiming to love spending time with dogs. She buys his dog toys and plays with her on the floor - but hasnapost cuddled her from the day she moved in.  He added: She has also never walked the dog a single time, even when I asked because I would have been late to work or was sick and really could have used her help. No - she refuses. She has a snake which is not my jam at all, I dislike reptiles, but itaposs part of her and I acknowledge that and whatever positives it brings her I accept because it makes her happy and thataposs what matters to me. I respect her and what she likes, although I am sometimes hesitant, but iaposm there with open arms. Not a deal at all. While most users agreed that his girlfriend is being unreasonable about not allowing the dog on the sofa, especially when he owns the house and furniture inside, others spoke about the red flags he highlighted in his relationship. One user said: Someone who does a complete turn around after getting what they want - which was to move in - is a major red flag. She manipulated you into letting her move in and now she’s being abusive to your dog. Itaposs time for a new girlfriend. While another user added: I have the feeling the issue isn’t so much with the dog as it is other aspects of the relationship and your dog is just acting as a catalyst here. If your partner is not open to conversation about it, you’re likely better off giving up the relationship altogether or having a mediator like a counsellor help you two explore why you two cannot compromise.

But is splashing the cash on a pricey meal actually worth it  Birmingham Live reporter Kirsty Bosley headed down to Adamaposs, a Michelin star restaurant in Birmingham, to find out.In total, Kirsty spent £ on the experience and for her money, she was treated to a tasting menu that included everything on the restaurantaposs menu. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The restaurant Kirsty noted she was blown away by the service she received as soon as she walked through the doors - with staff on hand to take her coat, and see her to her table. The reporter was also impressed by the decision to remove the extra chair from her table-for-one, as she said it eliminated the feeling of being lonely that an empty chair can sometimes bring when dining by yourself. Whataposs more, Adamaposs remembered Kirstyaposs request to be shown the vegetarian menu when she booked her table and stuck to it throughout the evening so the reporter didnapost have to think about her dietary requirements.  According to Kirsty, Adamaposs offers three courses for £, five for £, or the whole menu for £ - which is called the tasting menu. The reporter chose to try a little bit of everything and ordered herself a £ peach Bellini on top to wash it all down. The food Kirsty was treated to seven dishes in total, including four starters, the main course and two puddings - although the reporter admitted it was hard to keep track of which dishes she was getting. Although the dishes she received were small, Kirsty noted that the flavour of every morsel was better than she had expected, and left her wanting more every time.  First, the woman received a pretty red beetroot meringue with some kind of little rice cracker thing on top, as well as two pieces of cucumber that the lady who brought it tipped green gazpacho over. Kirsty said she loved both dishes and had initially assumed they were part of her starters until she was informed they were actually just other little dishes to try which the restaurant did not charge more for. When the reporteraposs starters did arrive, they came with a stack of four knives, four forks and four spoons - leaving Kirsty to believe she was going to be truly out of her depth. But the woman was instead overcome with emotion when she tried her first starter consisting of cucumber, lime, and wasabi, as she said: My eyes watered, my mouth watered. It was a ridiculous explosion of flavours that sent my senses into overdrive. I could have kissed the chefsuch a thing wouldnapost get me barred for le.  Kirsty even told the waitress she had enjoyed her starter so much she wanted to lick the plate, and thought her taste experience couldnapost get any better - until the second starter arrived. The reporter was treated to white asparagus with edible flowers followed by leek parcels and Jerusalem artichoke, and she explained that by the end of the third starter a tear had actually escaped and made its way happily down my nose. Kirstyaposs main course, wild mushrooms, was described as thrilling and the two desserts were to die for. The woman said she even got little extra treats when she was paying her bill, including a little bottle of salted caramel and miso syrup for her afternoon coffee and a aposgooey salted caramel chocolateapos to take away. Final thoughts In total, Kirsty spent £. on her Michelin star food journey - and while the price tag was definitely more than your standard trip to Nandos, she said she would save up to do it again in a heartbeat. Summing up her experience, she wrote: While Iaposd got a few photos of my dishes, and one of me enjoying one, I was aware that nothing could possibly capture that experience. The way that all of my senses had been aroused, it just felt like alchemy. Suddenly, they were not tiny little plates of food for big prices. They were experiences, knowledge and expertise, presented in such a way that I could have flownI wasnapost anchored to the restaurant floor by a crisp table topped with stacks of cutlery.

The scenes shown on the news over recent days have been overwhelming for many of us, and after the womanaposs daughter came home very upset and worried about what might happen, she took to Mumsnet to claim it was inappropriate of the school to tell young children about the conflict.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. In her post, she said: I think that it is important for children to know what is happening in the world - to an extent.My -year-old daughter came home today very upset and worried as she had seen on Newsround - which is shown at her school - that Russia has invaded Ukraine. She has asked me several timeswe were going to get aposhitapos. I have tried to reassure her that it wonapost happenand not to worry. She then asked me to swear on her le that we wonapost be affected by it. I said I couldnapost swear on her le but not to worry, it wonapost happen.She is very anxious and I just donapost think something so serious should have been shown to -year-old children. I feel so sorry for them, theyaposve had Covid and now this! Commenters on the forum were quick to remind the mum that Newsround is specically designed for children between the ages of six and , and said the language that was used will have been appropriate for her daughteraposs age group. And others also noted that although the young girlaposs fear is understandable, itaposs also important for her to learn about world news in a well-informed and appropriately explained way. One person said: Newsround is designed for children of her age though, isn’t it  Maybe a heads up from the school would be good so parents are ready to answer questions, but children are going to overhear adults talking about it so it’s better that it’s explained properly. While another added: My eight-year-old has seen Newsround at school. In my opinion, it’s better they learn about these types of things in a well informed and appropriately explained way that enables discussion and the chance to allay fear, than overhearing snippets of adult conversation and scaring yourself half to death imagining the rest. The mum isnapost the only one to have raised concerns about schools showing Newsround episodes to students though, as we previously covered the story of another mum who said she didnapost want her kids, aged eight and , to watch the programme because she deemed it too alarming. She wrote: “Every class at my children’s school seems to watch Newsround on a daily basis. “We deliberately avoid watching the news with them around, because so much of it is alarming for people who havenapost yet got adult perspective on things. “News TV is deliberately curated to make it as arresting and attention-grabbing as possible, and obviously concentrates more on the bad stuff than anything .

The woman took to Mumsnet to vent her frustration after her friend told her she hadnapost received an invite to her upcoming th birthday party because they were already going away together, and she didnapost want her to attend both celebrations.Sharing her post anonymously, the woman claimed the party is taking place just  minutes away from her house and said other mutual friends of theirs are invited - but she wonapost be going as the birthday girl has banned her.

Is it unreasonable to be a bit hurt annoyed by this  Iaposm also now not sure what to do for her actual birthday.The mum insisted sheaposs friends with people who have been invited to the party and has no idea why she wouldnapost be invited herself - but thinks it could be because she would have technically already celebrated her birthday. She added in follow-up posts: I donapost have beef with anyone at the party and one person is more my friend than hers. I think the reasoning was more that we would have already celebrated her birthday. Comments on the Mumsnet post were equally baffled by the friendaposs actions, as no one could work out why the mum wouldnapost be invited.

He said: So I personally find this hilarious but my mother does not. I recently got a lab puppy and I named him Woof.Some of my friends like it, others think it is silly, while my mother hates it. Unable to understand why her son would name his dog Woof, the mum refuses to walk his dog in public. He says his mum cannot fathom calling Woofaposs name in a park as it would fill her with too much embarrassment to shout within earshot of others. I guess thataposs just my own sense of humour because I laugh when I call my dogaposs name out loud at a dog park, he added.  Although he has told his mum she doesnapost have to walk his dogshe doesnapost want to, the son says he wouldnapost be able to contain his laughterhe heard her shouting: Woof! Come here! No, Woof, Woof. No get down Woof! Woof!apos. He added: Itaposs not like I need her to walk him as my girlfriend and I have plenty of time to do that ourselves - but my mother thinks iaposm a bit of an a***h*** for the name still. While most users agreed it is a hilarious name for a dog, others sought inspiration from it and came up with their own future dog names. One user said:I want to name a dog Everyone so I can yell aposEveryone, get I insideapos and aposEveryone stop snfing my a***!apos This seems fine and fun.

One owner knows this all too well after venting his frustration about his Yorkshire terrier who is always at the vets and leaving him out of pocket almost every month.Speaking about his accident-prone pooch on Reddit, the man explained how he adopted a -year-old dog in June last year - and has been back and forth to the vets ever since.He said: I love him but he’s the stupidest dog to ever exist. I’ve never had a dog this dumb.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  His dog has a aposfascination for peeing in peculiar places, such as inside spiky bushes or on other creatures. He loves peeing in ant hills but is very allergic to ants, he said. I often have to bring him into the vet because he peed in an anthill and the ants didn’t like it.Just today he climbed into a bush to pee, and I had to pull splinters out of his testicles. Unable to teach him a single command, not even apossitapos, the man is at a loss with his dog, saying Iaposm just worried for his safety at this point. He added: He also constantly jumps off of things he shouldn’t. He weighs five pounds and sprains his legs a lot. I turn away for five seconds and he’s trying to hurt himself in some dumb way. He also loves to eat plastic and I have had to shove my fingers down his throat to stop him from choking more times than I can count. The man believes his dogaposs lack of intelligence stems from being abused by his previous owner - and from being locked away from the world around him. He has a few broken bones that healed, and I know he was locked in a tiny kennel for five years straight before I got him, he said. They gave him food and water, and cleaned the kennel once a month, but they never took him to a groomer or talked to him.So I’m trying my best, but he may just be happy to be out, so he’s exploring and doing everything he loves. Before asking for advice, the man explained how he has previously worked with a professional trainer and has been trying out their tips on his dumb dog - but it all just goes over the dogaposs head. He said: He’s on a two-foot leash when we’re out. He physically can’t pull away from our feet but he still finds ant hills.We also have stairs to prevent him jumping off stuff but he still jumps. While most users laughed at his clumsy dog, others tried to share a word of advice with the struggling owner.One user said: Not going to lie, I laughed at the mental image of your dog peeing on an anthill.Your dog, while dumb, sounds adorable!But yes, it is a safety issue. My advice would be to work with a dog trainer on teaching your dog commands like aposcome,apos apossit and aposleave itapos - these are important for safety and setting boundaries . Another user added: I am so sorry you are having such a hard time, but your writing is so funny that I couldnapost help chuckle at the thought of you pulling splinters out of his testicles. Have you tried positive reinforcement, wherehe pees on a clear grass patch as opposed to somewhere he shouldn’t, you reward him Or a really short leash till he is done peeing and then more room for him to walk after that  Ramps and steps should help with the jumping too.

Ukraine confirmed earlier today that  civilians and military personnel had been killed in the country during the first day of the assault, with more than  wounded in the fighting. Far from the frontlines, Putin took a call from China’s President Xi Jinping, Aljazeera reports. According to state broadcaster CCTV, XI said: “[The] “situation in eastern Ukraine has undergone rapid changes … [and] China supports Russia and Ukraine to resolve the issue through negotiation. He added Putin should “abandon the Cold War mentality, attach importance to and respect the reasonable security concerns of all countries, and form a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism through negotiations”. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.So far, it has been confirmed by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky that  civilians and military personnel were killed in the country on the first day of the Russian invasion. In an address to his people, Mr Zelensky revealed a further  had been wounded in the fighting. The death toll is set to rise as, on the night of February , Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar claimed nearly , Russian servicemen had died during the first two days of the deep invasion She wrote in a Facebook post that the troops of the invading country have suffered the following lossesas of pm Friday, before going on to list up to  tanks  armoured combat vehicles of ious types  aircraft seven helicopters and , special staff she claims were among the losses suffered by Russia. Meanwhile, the official Twitter page of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine claimed in a tweet that today the number of losses from the occupying forces of the Russian Federation is more than  thousand. These claims have not yet been independently veried. According to the Chinese media readout, Putin replied saying: “The United States and NATO have long ignored Russia’s reasonable security concerns, repeatedly reneged on their commitments, and continued to advance military deployment eastward, challenging Russia’s strategic bottom line.“Russia is willing toconduct high-level negotiationswith Ukraine.”China has refused to call its ally’s actions an invasion or criticise Putin’s actions which have dragged the world to the brink of war. This evening the nation abstained voting in the United Nations Security Council draft resolution that condemned Russia for invading Ukraine.  Other world leaders have heavily criticised Russiaaposs invasion, amid warnings of heavy sanctions on the Kremlin. Putin’s troops are marching on Kyiv with brave Ukrainian troops positioned on the streets to block Russian invaders. Civilians have been urged to target invaders using petrol bombs, with Ukrainian men aged between  and  barred from leaving the country and told to take up arms.  This morning Ukrainian deputy defence minister Anna Maliar said enemy troops had driven two Ukrainian army trucks into Kyiv, followed by a convoy of military trucks.In aFacebookpost she said the Russians were “moving at speed to the centre of Kiev, adding: “They will surely be destroyed.”Boris Johnson earlier condemned Russia for unleashing a “tidal wave of violence” onUkraine , warningPutinwould achieve “pariah status”.

He counted  explosions as Russia targeted military establishments on the citys outskirts before am this morning after Vladimir Putin ordered an invasionAn image taken from the Ukrainian Presidents office after an explosionopinionByAndy Lines in Kyiv:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments As I stood in the darkness on a hotel roof in Kyiv at am, the sky was suddenly lit up by a massive, ominous orange glow and I heard and felt a booming explosion.The blast – the sound of a Russian missile hitting its target – was too close for comfort. Before am I counted  explosions as Russia targeted military establishments on the city’s outskirts. It seemed scarcely believable that a full scale invasion could take place in Europe in .As Russia sent its forces into Ukraine, it is feared that more than  people, including  soldiers and one child, have been killed.Tens of thousands of terried families have fled the capital.  When the bombardment started this morning I was standing on a pavement on a deserted road in central Kyiv with an Italian TV reporter who I had never met before. We had been woken minutes earlier by a faint rumbling noise in the distance and went out to investigate. At first I couldn’t believe the bombing could be so close to Kyiv. As I nervously climbed the stairs up to the roof of the hotel the bangs became louder. This was when I felt the huge explosion and realised I was witnessing a powerful sustained attack. Dawn broke an hour or so later and screeching air sirens started to wail – overpowering the gentle chimes of church bells marking the time.  The sirens sent terried pedestrians running into the church for safety. Some people were driving to work. Two women walked their dogs in the church square, asunaware of Vladimir Putin’s attack. It was surreal. But within hours the enormity of the assault had been fully realised across the city. As two fighter jets flew over the capital, there were long queues at cashpoints. Postman Peter Aliyev, , said: “I wanted to get some money out when I could. I have a young family and we will head out of Kyiv this morning to get to the countryside to stay with relatives.” A young woman in tears joined the queue. The city was living on its nerves as it awaited the next attack.  It remained unclear last night how close Russian tanks are to the capital. Airborne troops have reached a military airport just  miles away. And at least six helicopters were seen flying over Hostomel, a commuter town on the outskirts of Kyiv. Apartment complexes in some cities were hit by missiles. One woman, a teacher, in Chuhuiv had blood pouring from a head wound. The deep metro system in Kyiv at least gave families some safety. Hundreds of children and dozens of pet cats and dogs were on the s of one station.  A student Andriy, , said: “We have always regarded Russia as our big brother. I didn’t expect this to happen. And this is just the start – we have no idea what will happen next. Ukraine will never be the same after this.” People had packed up what they could and fled in their cars – hoping their homes and possessions will still be there when andthey . On a motorway heading out of Kyiv there was a traffic jam stretching miles. Families got out and chatted nervously until the sirens went off again and they jumped back into their cars.  Some people walked down the side of the motorway wheeling suitcases and thumbing for a lt. At the main bus station, coaches were packed to the rafters as they drove off. Many shops were shut, and many of the ones that were open had run out of food. In the city centre I saw a -strong convoy of army vehicles speeding towards government buildings. Across the road dozens of men queued to join the military after receiving their conscription papers. The mayor, ex-world boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, imposed a curfew from pm today to am tomorrow.  He said the metro “will be available as shelters  ”, but added: “If you need to move around the city during the curfew... you must have identication documents.” The streets of Kyiv were eerily quiet last night. Bars and cafes were shut as police cars patrolled the city centre. Ukraine’s favourite sporting son, ex-Cha striker Andriy Shevchenko, said on social media his country had gone through “many dficult times” and that its greatest asset is its “sincere and freedom-loving people”. Those citizens are praying they will soon be free of tyrant Putin.

In a bomb ­shelter. “Can you imagine  This is our reality.”Earlier it was reported that the oncology centre of another hospital was left in flames after Russian forces openedfireon the building.

Russian missiles are said to have destroyed a nursery where in Ukraine, with drone footage seeming to show the bodies of two adults surrounded by blood outside the building.Outraged Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter : “Today’s Russian attacks on a kindergarten and an orphanage are war crimes and violations of the Rome Statute.#“Together with the General Prosecutor’s Office we are collecting this and other facts, which we will immediately send to the Hague. “Responsibility is inevitable.

People left the city by car, train, bus, bike and even on footA woman and two children walk on a street after crossing the Slovak-Ukrainian border in Ubla, eastern Slovakia Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByAndy LinesChief reporter:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Thousands of people fled the Ukrainian capital today as the Russian invasion continued. Mirror reporter Andy Lines was among those who had to leave Kyiv because Russian tanks were getting close to his hotel.Here he recounts his experience... It was an incredible and dramatic exodus - all to escape from war. Tens of thousands of terried people desperately inched their way towards safety. I joined those fleeing Kyiv today to avoid the horrors of the Russian invasion. They went by car, train, bus, bike and even on foot. For security reasons we had been ordered to leave Kyiv immediately as Russian tanks rolled in perilously close to our hotel. Before we left at am I had already been evacuated for fear of a missile attack into a deep underground car park - twice! It truly was an extraordinary day.  On one of the country’s busiest motorways we passed a squadron of Ukrainian tanks hiding in the verges. The Ts and Ts were waiting to repel any Russian invaders. But to see them standing there - with their commanders sitting on the top ready for action - so close to a motorway service station was particularly chilling. We had inched along mile after mile after mile on the E before reaching the MO. I’ve never seen a traffic jam like it. It was horrendous. In the first four and a half hours we covered just seven miles. There was one three hour period when our driver never once got into second gear.  It took us five hours  minutes just to get out of the city. There were rusty -year-old Ladas, tractors and brand new expensive Mercedes. Minibuses, motorbikes and giant trucks politely competed for space. But everyone knew the enormity of the situation and I only heard one angry toot of a horn during the gruelling  hours trek. All the drivers wanted to do was to reach safety for the night. Former factory worker Vasiliy, , wound down his window during one stop. He was driving his light blue battered old Lada with just one working rear brake light. He had driven in to Kyiv to pick up his son, daughter-in-law and grandchild. On his roof rack was a pushchair and a suitcase. He said: “I come from Zhytomyr in central Ukraine.“I came to pick up my son who lives in Kyiv. I came yesterday when I heard that Kyiv was shelled. “I’m glad we were able to get out and leave.” As cars edged past us they were all packed many with four or five people squeezed into the back seat. All were sombre. No-one was laughing. But despite that there was a real spirit of camaraderie. We passed the same cars on the three-lane carriageway so often that we ended up on nodding terms. Several people gave me a thumbs up and reassuring wave when they realised we were journalists.  One woman was making a cheese and tomato sandwich on her lap for her young son. She spoke no English but opened her window and signalled to ask meI’d like her to make me one as well. Many cars had children and grannies and several had pet cats and dogs. One woman had her brown pomeranian sitting in her lap in the front seat - constantly stroking it to give the dog reassurance. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.So far, it has been confirmed by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky that  civilians and military personnel were killed in the country on the first day of the Russian invasion. In an address to his people, Mr Zelensky revealed a further  had been wounded in the fighting. The death toll is set to rise as, on the night of February , Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar claimed nearly , Russian servicemen had died during the first two days of the deep invasion She wrote in a Facebook post that the troops of the invading country have suffered the following lossesas of pm Friday, before going on to list up to  tanks  armoured combat vehicles of ious types  aircraft seven helicopters and , special staff she claims were among the losses suffered by Russia. Meanwhile, the official Twitter page of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine claimed in a tweet that today the number of losses from the occupying forces of the Russian Federation is more than  thousand. These claims have not yet been independently veried. In another, a black and white spaniel sat between two young children. What was more incredible we passed thousands and thousands of people actually WALKING to safety. The Polish border may be over  miles away from Kyiv but they wanted to make a start. Carrying huge rucksacks, supermarket shopping bags and wheeling suitcases they walked along the hard shoulder.  The blue and yellow Ukraine flag fluttered on a huge advertising screen. Underneath a group of youngsters walked with their cases. At times the line of people stretched as far as the eye could see. Some stopped in lay-bys for a break and to play with their children. Ten miles out from Kyiv a group, including several women, stood at the roadside trying to hitch a lt. Then within a mile there were dozens and dozens more. I’ve never seen so many hitchhikers on a single stretch of road.  On the other side of the carriageway as we headed west several convoys of Ukrainian troops were racing back down into Kyiv ready for the fight ahead. Several of them proudly paraded the Ukrainian flag. As they drove past they received huge cheers. When we were still in Kiev, before we reached the countryside, there was a massive military presence. Along the side of the road armed camouflaged soldiers hid under netting, surrounded by green sandbags, waiting for any Russian troops heading in. Outside the Beresteiski metro station a squad of heavily armed soldiers stood on guard.  One smoked a cigarette and yawned as he spoke to an elderly woman. In the city there were queues at every cashpoint we passed. But they were nothing compared to the lines of cars at the petrol stations. They were huge and some drivers were forced to resort to pushing their vehicles to the pumps to make use of every last bit of fuel.  And there chaotic scenes at the main railway station as people clamoured to get on the last trains out. Mums, dads and children pushed to get on and most trains were absolutely crammed. Very few people wanted to stay and those who did wanted to fight. The rest fled wonderingthey would ever be able toto their homes. The journey to Lviv took  hours but it was a route for safety for so many.

Incredibly the driver, said by witnesses to be an elderly man, survived the shocking ordeal in the under-siege Ukrainian capital. The widely shared clip shows the tank, believed to be a Strela- anti-aircraft vehicle, swerve across the road into the car, which was driving in the opposite direction. After remaining still with the crushed vehicle beneath it for nearly  seconds, the tank then slowly reverses back into the road, leaving a wreckage in its wake. It is understood to have been recorded in the Obolon district of the city, where Russian forces have been advancing in the past  hours.Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates The video, filmed from a window overlooking the road, has sparked outrage. Witness Viktor Berbash, , told AFP news agency he had rushed out of his home after hearing gunfire.He continued: I saw an armoured vehicle and there was automatic fire. And here this car, with probably an anti-aircraft gun on it, was already here.He added: Two armoured vehicles were driving along the road, and the second of them deliberately drove into the oncoming lane.  It was not by chance, it was for fun, there was no need for this. And it just ran into this car. Stopped, reversed over it again and drove on. It is unclear whether the tank was a Russian or Ukrainian military vehicle, but reports suggest that those steering it were Russian. Shocked locals were able to free the victim, but it is unclear whether he suffered any serious injuries.Among those who shared the video was political adviser Franak Viacorka, who wrote: In Ukraine, a Russian tank had driven over the civilian car. Terrying footage. My thoughts are with the people of Ukraine. Further pictures and video show the damaged black car at the road, with an elderly-looking man looking dazed but alive. Mr Viacorka posted minutes later: A Ukrainian senior man in a car hit by the Russian tank survived! Ukrainians have been urged to use Molotov cocktails to neutralise Russian invaders as desperate fighting goes into its second day.

The dramatic clip shows Sky correspondent Alex Rossi scrambling for cover with his camera crews as the shelling descended in the coastal city of Berdyansk, just  miles from strategically vital city of Mariupol. After getting to safety in a nearby building, Alex told viewers: It just shows how quickly things can change here. We were outside filming. [It was] really calm. There had been shells that had come in this morning. But again, it had gone quiet, everything felt very, very normal. Follow our live blog of the Russia Ukraine conflict here  We’ve just had to come in here to take cover because there’s been incoming mortar fire. Mariupol is the most important Ukrainian port in the Azov Sea but mainly handles smaller ships between , to , tonnes deadweight, the Mail reports. But the city appears to have come under attack by Russian forces as Putin attempts to cripple the Ukrainian economy by destroying the vital shipping route. The port alongside others connected to the Avoz Sea is a major exporting route for goods such as wheat, barley and corn to Mediterranean importers including Turkey, Italy, Cyprus, Egypt and Lebanon. Russian troops have already been deployed to guard the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, launch strikes on key airbases and surrounded Kyiv on three sides as they attempt to take the city.Fears have been raised about increased levels of radiation after Russian forces took over the Chernobyl exclusion zone and disturbed the top soil, kicking up radioactive dust. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.So far, it has been confirmed by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky that  civilians and military personnel were killed in the country on the first day of the Russian invasion. In an address to his people, Mr Zelensky revealed a further  had been wounded in the fighting. The death toll is set to rise as, on the night of February , Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar claimed nearly , Russian servicemen had died during the first two days of the deep invasion She wrote in a Facebook post that the troops of the invading country have suffered the following lossesas of pm Friday, before going on to list up to  tanks  armoured combat vehicles of ious types  aircraft seven helicopters and , special staff she claims were among the losses suffered by Russia. Meanwhile, the official Twitter page of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine claimed in a tweet that today the number of losses from the occupying forces of the Russian Federation is more than  thousand. These claims have not yet been independently veried.But Russia has refuted Ukrainian officials claims that there has been any increase in gamma radiation.Speaking in a televised statement this morning, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was Russiaaposs number one target and feared he would be abducted in an effort to topple the countryaposs political system.  He said: “According to our information, the enemy marked me as target number one, my family as target number two.“They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state. We have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv.”Zelensky is in hiding but claimed he was still in Kyiv last night as he resists fleeing his capital. “I am staying in the government quarter together with others,” he said.

Ralph aposTerryapos Gibbs, , took girlfriend Carol Lisle, , from the nursing home in Mandurah, Australia, and drove her , miles to bring her home.He drove her across the sweltering Outback to Queensland on January  because they could no longer be apart. The couple have been together for  years and he acted out of love after she was moved across the country by her family. Two days after they left the facility, he was found with Lisle, who has dementia and Parkinsonaposs. She reportedly was distressed when police found them deep in a desert in C heat - just  miles from the Northern Territory border dressed in the same clothes as she was in when she was first taken. And now, Ralph has been killed in a car crash, according toNine News reports.His death yesterday morning came just  hours after Carol - the love of his le - passed away in her sleep. Lisle had originally been taken to Perth by her goddaughter last year while Ralph was recovering from an illness in hospital. Earlier this month police confirmed Ralph was initially charged with deprivation of liberty and endangering le, but he pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawful detention on February . Magistrate Raelene Johnston said sentencing Gibbs was not an easy exercise after the pensioner told Perth magistrates court that he was acting out of love.  On Friday, February , said it was clear that Gibbs just wanted to be with his partner of  years but added that his actions were entirely misguided. She said: I accept that you believe you were acting out of love and that you were acting out of care for your partner and that you wanted to be with her, and you believed that she wanted to be with you. But objectively your conduct was extremely dangerous, and the objective seriousness of your offending was made clear by the reactions of those people who observed you. She went on to explain to the court that his actions were premeditated as Gibbs had purchased a car, jerry cans of petrol and a map of the country just days before. You placed your personal desire over the welfare of your partner, she added. You continued to place your wishes above her needs. You must have known you were struggling to look after her, yet you continued on your journey. Your conduct could have compromised her health. Given the extremely remote location you were found in. Johnston acknowledged that Gibbs had no previous convictions but said a jail sentence needed to be imposed despite his lawyer arguing that a fine would have been more appropriate. Gibbs fears that he will never see his partner again after it was announced he would be sentenced to seven monthsapos jail, suspended for  months, with a two-year restraining order. I have been fighting for a year to get her back so we can see each other because she has dementia and may not last much longer, he had said outside of court.

When the family ask why I’ve turned into a ­military fetishist excited by tanks, bombs and corpses I put them straight. And tell them I’m consuming the ­ultimate comfort dish. Because nothing lts the spirits like watching deranged, bloodthirsty dictators get their comeuppance in glorious technicolour. Sadly we’re seeing a deranged, bloodthirsty dictator wreaking havoc again, but now it’s in real-time on mainstream news. And it will be a long time before we can watch the story of Vladimir Putin ’s downfall with any comfort or joy.But come, his downfall will. ­Hopefully when enough Russian people outside of the KGB clique who now nod at his every insane proclamation about annexing Eastern Europe into a new Soviet empire, realise that he’s Adolf Hitler with Botox. Joseph Stalin with built-up heels. A shirtless Kim Jong Un flashing his sagging pecs.Another small, paranoid ­megalomaniac demanding respect from a world he despises for not recognising his ine destiny to rule however, or wherever, he wants, unopposed. We’re witnessing so many laughable attempts to brainwash the Russian people into believing he has a legitimate right to invade another sovereign state, it feels like watching Armando Iannucci’s satire The Death Of Stalin.  The meeting where he bullied his closest advisers into fearing they’ll soon be Novichocked, which we’re told took place at pm when we see a wristwatch saying pm. The staged footage of alleged Ukrainian attacks on pro-Russian sympathisers, which are so amateurish and error-strewn You’ve Been Framed should send the Kremlin £ for each comic gem.And the most risible claim of all: that Putin is invading Ukraine to liberate its people from “Nazication” when he’s the one the world is currently picking out in a Hitler identity parade.There are some in Britain who sympathise with Putin’s view that NATO’s uncompromising presence on his borders had gone too far. Others claim the EU has “poked the Russian bear” too much by ­arrogantly expanding east.  Many, like me, can’t stomach the hypocrisy of this government lambasting Putin’s abuse of power when they are funded by oligarchs and his cronies, and hate to see Boris Johnson exploit the crisis to distract from his own criminal activity at home. But that should not stop any right-minded person from seeing Putin for what he is. A deranged, rogue dictator who shares none of our values and is an existential threat to world peace. A cruel-hearted autocrat who censors his media, imprisons adversaries, crushes gay rights, poisons opponents on foreign soil and rules by fear.  A tyrant who ides the nation’s wealth up not among the people but himself and his kleptomaniac cronies whose most vocerous admirers all seem to be on the hard right: Jair Bolsonaro, Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, Nigel Farage etc. Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny tweeted from his cell this week that Putin was like a “drunk grandfather” inducing “imperial hysteria” which would be funnyhe didn’t have nuclear codes in his hands. Hopefully, one day soon, we can look at his humiliating demise from our couches and laugh.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

her Covid strategic frameworkalso known as a roadmap out of Coronavirusrestrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeonwill give an update to @ScotParlon #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAefrom :pm. pic LKTccbDIm— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , What did Nicola Sturgeon say today Free PCR testing to continue in ScotlandNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the healthbudget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.remove: Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rulesNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”Covid isolation to continuePeople who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination updateVaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform websitefor more information.Vaccine Passport SchemeThe First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .Face covering restrictions to end on March The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transportwill end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Latest Covid casesToday, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegvpic WCZTIZVjw— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , The First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-.more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"Gigs in Scotland has today released the newsthat Calvin Harris will be coming to Scotland.The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"\" fill\"#\"View this post on InstagramtranslateY\"translateX translateYwidth: .pxflex-grow: margin-right: pxmargin-left: px\"translateY\"translateY rotate\"\"\"translateX\"A post shared by Gigs in Scotland The DJ and producer will also be ing to Creamfields this summer.

goodie bags which were greatly appreciated.We would like to thank him very much for taking time out of his busy schedule for us.Regarding plans to demolish flats in a sensitive area of the town, as reported in last week#s front page article #Have a say on planned Dalintober demolition#, these are iconic buildings in terms of the aesthetic value they bring to the town#s outstanding seafront location.I fully understand the need to reduce housing stock, in line with a declining population, but previously demolished buildings in adjacent areas – Saddell Street and Queen Street – are now unsightly gap-sites.Local opinion is important, given what has happened in the wake of recent housing demolition. There is concern, often heard in local conversation and frequently discussed on Facebook, of what might happen in the latest round of town planning.To be fair, plans are afoot to replace the same with modern housing – probably less stock to suit the demands that exist in the town at the moment – however, it is really important any proposed build be sensitive in design to suit this prime parkland location, an area fronting onto Kinloch Park and town#s seafront Esplanade.I share this concern, given the results of previous demolition, but also hope any future plans will include thoughts to increase housing stock, this in line with greater employment opportunities and rising population levels.I am appealing to people throughout the region to support my Right to Food Bill proposal before the consultation closes on Wednesday February .In the wake of Ofgem#s eyewatering increase in the energy price cap last week, which will see already struggling households having to wrestle between paying for heating or paying for food, the Right to Food has never been more needed.If the SNP and the Greens hadn#t played party politics and kicked my Bill back, we could have already been working on ensuring the Right to Food is enshrined in Scots law.Instead, we are having to re-consult at a time when the country is already grappling with a cost of living crisis.On Thursday, Ofgem announced that from April the energy price cap would rise  per cent to £, – that is an extra £ households will have to find just to keep their homes warm and the lights on.Forthcoming increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in. People need help now.Food bank volunteers need assurance that the invaluable support they provide in their communities will end one day, when wages and benefits are adequate enough for proud families to be able to stop using the food banks.New statistics show rising homelessness across Scotland. Food bank use is soaring. Illnesses of the past like rickets and malnutrition have reappeared.In a rich nation like Scotland, in the st century, this is appalling. It#s Dickensian.People are struggling right now – it#s time the First Minister stops commentating on the cost of living crisis and starts doing something about it.She could start by allowing her MSPs to support my proposal."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 11 2022","story":"I was excited to see Seville oranges in the grocers.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges."},{"url":null,"title":"driver woes derail oban golfer bobs title bid","story":"The honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member finished tied in ninth place at the Ras al Khaimah Classic on the final leg of the DP World Tour#s Desert Swing, building on his solid performance over the same course the previous week.After carding an almost flawless opening round of  on Thursday, Robert suffered a cruel piece of bad luck before his Friday round after the face of his driver cracked during his warm up on the practise range.Speaking after carding a  on Saturday, following his  on Friday, Robert said he struggled with his replacement driver.#Unfortunately, my driver cracked on Friday morning and I#ve not got the perfect replacement but no-one does,# said the left-hander.#Off the tee, I#m trying to find my golf ball.

Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"town causes to land co op cash","story":"Thanks to Co-op members choosing the supermarket#s own-branded products and services, over £ million has been raised for more than , causes since .Each year, members are encouraged to pick a local cause in their community that supports access to food, mental wellbeing support or opportunities for young people, helping to build stronger, more resilient communities across the UK.In Tarbert, Fèis an Tairbeirt, Tarbert Soccer Centre and Tarbert After School Care are to receive grants and, in Mid Argyll, Argyll and Bute Befrienders, Mid-Argyll Transport Volunteers and Mid Argyll Multiple Sclerosis Centre will benefit.#We know that this year is going to be another incredibly challenging year for local causes and communities,# said Rebecca Birkbeck, director of community and membership at the Co-op.#With the cost of living rising dramatically already this year, charities are likely to bear the brunt of people being more conscious about their spending.#At the Co-op, we work hard to bring people together to ‘co-operate for a fairer world’.

The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television

Is that consultation  Certainly not.The key issue is to slow the flow of water into the river flowing through Musselburgh. Nature-based solutions are part of the solution: planting trees, rewetting the flood plains, digging ponds, blocking ditches and drains – all natural common sense and all good value for public money.Compare these works with the £m required to remove and replace four bridges on the spurious grounds that they impede the flow. Impeding the flow upstream should be the preferred approach.By all means include a tree catcher at the A bridge, but add another one just upstream of the mill lade to catch the willows from The Grove that periodically fall into the river.

As hellebores are native to woodland, they’ll enjoy plenty of organic matter, so make sure you add some when planting and add mulch from time to time to help retain the moisture in the soil. If you’re planting under trees, they will have to compete for water so you may need to provide water until it is well established. Once it’s well-rooted, the organic matter in the soil, the mulch and its broad leaves will generally maintain adequate moisture levels, although you may need to water occasionallythere’s a particularly dry spell.The real bonus with the hellebore is that, as a perennial, it will continue to grow bigger over time and after a few years you’ll be able to ide it into several plants – and all gardeners just love free plants!Garrya ellipticaSometimes known as the ‘silk tassel’ bush, this medium-sized evergreen shrub is native to coastal areas of America and so it’s quite happy in East Lothian gardens, where salty winds from the North Sea can be testing for our plants.This easy-to-grow shrub is a great addition to the garden, providing a backdrop to the vibrant colours in the summer garden. However, it really comes into its own in the winter garden, when the glossy green leaves provide welcome foliage and an abundance of beautul silk-like tassels at this time of year.Jasminum nudlorumMore commonly known as the winter-flowering jasmine, this deciduous shrub is unusual in that it flowers before producing its foliage.A robust, medium-sized shrub, it’s often trained against a wall or used as ground cover. It is happy in coastal areas and so ideal for our East Lothian gardens.The bright yellow flowers give a wonderful show at this time of year and are a sure sign that spring is on its way! It’s very easy to grow and tolerant of a wide range of conditions.CamelliaSometimes called the Japanese rose, camellias have been cultivated in Chinese and Japanese gardens for many centuries. When the tea trade expanded in the late s, Camellias were imported by the British East India Company for the wealthy British owners and by the s they were considered to be the luxury flower and the height of fashion.With its glossy green leaves and stunning flowers, the evergreen camellia is one of the first shrubs to flower each year.One of our most popular garden plants, it can be grown as a shrub or small tree, and comes in a huge range of dferent shapes, sizes and flower colours. It grows well in both containers and borders, but don’t forget that they prefer acidic soil. If your soil isn’t naturally acidic, add plenty of ericaceous compost around the roots when planting and maintain the pH level by feeding with fertiliser for acid-loving plants.Just one interesting fact – did you know that the most widely grown camellia on earth is the commercial crop, Camellia sinensis  Grown for its leaves, Camellia sinensis is none other than the tea plant, whose leaves are harvested for tea drinkers around the world!Hopefully we’ve given you some ideas that’ll help you add interest to your garden in February. If you’d like more information, please do call in and have a chat with our knowledgeable and experienced plant team – we just love to talk

Sea to provide the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.  It was blocked for six days last March after sea vessel the Ever Given became wedged across it.Hundreds of container vessels and ships were caught up in the logjam created by the blockage, which put the canal – which sees about  per cent of global trade pass through it each day – out of action.The construction industry across Scotland has also been hit by worldwide material shortages, as well as staffing issues caused by the pandemic.The new Blindwells settlement, which sits between Prestonpans, Tranent and Longniddry, is expected to have , homes in total, with further land expected to be expanded into in the future.Under East Lothian Council’s planning policy,  per cent of new housing built by any developer must be affordable.At a virtual meeting of the council this week, it was revealed that the local authority had been expecting to deliver  new council houses in this financial year but delays at Blindwells were likely to have an effect on that final figure.In addition, the council had added  registered social landlordhousing units and  mid-market retail properties.Head of housing Wendy McGuire said

address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policy and the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in England as of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic framework also known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeon will give an update to @ScotParl on #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm. pic LKTccbDImNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”                                                                                                              : Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rules                                                                                                              This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”People who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform website for more information.The First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegv pic WCZTIZVjwThe First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-. more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

Russia, China and India have prepared a Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments Systemfor international banking transactions in case they’re frozen out of Swt .Arming and training Ukrainian forces for a long insurgency is a viable strategy, but the deaths and suffering for Ukrainians would be enormous.The least bad option might be to accept that, as unreasonable as Vladimir Putin is, some compromise may avoid more deaths. Nato could agree that Ukraine will never join and Ukraine could give limited autonomy for the Donbas region, infor Russian forces withdrawing, and Russia recognising the Ukrainian government as legitimate.Some may condemn this as appeasement. But what are the realistic alternatives  Russia has spent may years modernising its forces and has anti-air weapons capable of taking down Nato military planes. How many millions of people would die, lose loved ones or suffer for effective alternatives   And what use are sanctions that Russia is prepared for when it has alternative trading partners If Russia invaded a Nato member, war would become unavoidable. But how would any US government reactan anti-US alliance headed by Russia expanded through Latin America, with Russian troops arriving in many countries, and there was talk of Mexico joining it  Not much better than Mr Putin has.

We must hope that the BBC’s assessment is wrong, but for once I will take it at its word.First, Professor John Mearsheimer, of the University of Chicago, a leading proponent of the realist school of international relations, said on Wednesday in an online seminar with the student politics society of King College, Cambridge, that absorption of the Ukraine into Nato is a red line for Russia, end of.Secondly, Russia, with a GDP of that of Italy or Spain, take your pick, has a nuclear doctrine that incorporates its nuclear arsenal into its operational, possibly tactical, thinking. That is, its threshold of use is lower than that of say, the UK. We do have warheads that can dial down yields to levels similar to that of what passes for Russian battlefield-use levels.Thirdly, as Prof Mearsheimer goes on to say, there is a potential end point to this, other than Armageddon, Ukraine becoming a neutral country. If its good enough for Finland, which used to be part of the Imperial Russian Empire, its good enough for Ukraine I agree with him.Fourthly, only % of the American public are prepared to condone military action by the United States and thankfully we have the US Congressional elections in nine months time.Bill Ramsay, Glasgow.WHAT PRICE A NUCLEAR DETERRENT AN argument for nuclear weapons has been that it will prevent war on European soil.However, here we have a Russian dictator who is waging war on a sovereign country in Europe. We have to stand by and watch and rely on ineffectual sanctions to bring Vladimir Putin to heel.Why only this  Becausewe meet force with force, who knows how Mr Putin might react, including using nuclear weapons.Yet, had Mr Putin access only to conventional weapons, we could have met his aggression with appropriate military force. Might that have been deterrent enough to prevent this invasion  Who knows. But what we do know is, we are hamstrung.So much for the nuclear deterrent.William Thomson, Denny.IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN NO SURPRISEI FIND it incredible that Western leaders have expressed such surprise at the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The massive build-up of Russian troops and military hardware on the Ukraine borders taking place over the last several weeks was always a signal of their intentions to invade. The so-called exercises in Belarus in the north, the eastern fringes and the Black Sea to the south were clearly a smokescreen and for the West to watch this build-up of ,-plus troops and expect a diplomatic solution was naivety in the extreme.Now is the time for signicant, punitive and long-lasting sanctions against the Putin regime by Nato members and other western powers. God help the civilians of Ukraine.Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.LET US KEEP WATCHING RTI NOTE your report regarding banning Russia Today .I am one of those terrible people who turn on RT occasionally. I also look at the French news, Turkish, Al-Jazeera and the like and Bloomberg for financial news. I have been retired for many years and so can indulge myself by sitting in the morning and absorbing a wide iety of views. Is our Government going to stop me  I have given up watching BBC and STV in the morning because of the quality of the presentation and content.Now we are moving into a new phase where we are going to get all the propaganda about how good Ukraine is and how bad Russia is. Whether we agree or not, Russia feels threatened by Nato.I remember well when the boot was on the other foot. I was on a Thor missile base when the Cuban crisis took place and we were minutes away from a nuclear war because of how the US felt threatened. The USSR backed down . This time there was no backing down. We had no leaders with the ability to find a way out of the situation. They only threatened Russia. Let us hope that someone emerges who can find some way to stop the escalation of conflict. That will not come by selling more arms to Ukraine.Jim McAdam, Maidens.KREMLIN WOULD LOVE UK BREAK-UPWITH Russia invading Ukraine and war unleashed on European soil once more, Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP need to make clear whether they seriously wish to proceed with a second referendum to break up the United Kingdom in .The economic and social consequences of the SNP succeeding were always going to be severe, and to this can be added the geopolitical danger of destabilising a major Nato power at a time of war in Europe.One thing is for sure:the SNP succeeded in breaking up Britain, removing nuclear weapons from Scotland and casting the United Kingdom into the history books then Vladimir Putin, for one, would be delighted and dancing a jig in the Kremlin. No need for tanks in the UK when you have the SNP to do your work.Dr Bruce Halliday, Dumfries.PUTIN IS NOT LIKE HITLERBEING of a certain age, I can clearly recall the days and weeks preceding the declaration of the Second World War, the conversations, press comments and general atmosphere. There are many points of similarity but, equally, there are several signicant dferences which are patently obvious to an observer of history.For some years leading up to  Hitler and the Nazis had demonstrated beyond question the overwhelming national support for his regime. Quite apart from Hitler’s well-remembered political rallies where the audience was always immense and supportive, his other achievements in Germany had gathered him and his party huge popularity. Think of the VW Beetle, the autobahns, the Hitler Youth and other similar organisations. As well as having a nation totally behind him, Hitler was surrounded by his many loyal henchmen all bedecked in spectacular military unorms.In contrast, however, in Russia at present we have a solitary little man sitting alone in a huge room with unknown support and the few obvious lieutenants backing his ideas out of sight as he announces his plans to the world: apparently, all his own ideas created with many distortions and hoods. The national support for war is unknown.Vladimir Putin could be destroyed and the crisis probably ended with a single bullet, whereas destroying Hitler would only have killed one person and there were many who would have taken up the reins thereafter and carried on his work.Nigel Dewar Gibb, Glasgow.Read more: We have to stand up to the Russian mafia state"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-workplace-levy-unfair-many-scots","story":"Not everyone lives in cities. Not everyone has ready access to a reliable public transport network. Many people work unsociable hours which make it impossible for them to use public transport even where it is usually available. Not everyone is able to secure suitable employment near where they live. Many people, especially those with a particular skill set or specialised training, have to travel to find employment. Neither is it a simple matter to up sticks and move house to be nearer work. There may be many reasons, economic, social or practical why a person cannot move house.My last place of work, based near Prestwick Airport, was one of the biggest,not the biggest employer in the locality. It employed people from over a very large area. The company’s business was in the aeronautics industry and as such required workers with the necessary skills and or training. I know personally people who travelled daily from Girvan, Sanquhar, Greenock, Kirkintilloch and Balloch and these are just a few examples. Those people already pay a high price in travelling costs. To burden them with a workplace parking levy would simply be unfair.Everyone I know who travels to work by car is, where possible, in a car sharing pool. This is nota new concept. Car sharing was around long before people considered it to be “green”, it simply made economic sense. As well as car sharing, some car owners would often take non-car owners to work for a modest, mutually agreed contribution towards the travelling costs.As for working from home, the people referred to above are all skilled shop floor workers. They work hands-on with specialised tools and equipment, most of which is owned by the company and most of it is not portable. Like many in other types of employment, working from home simply is not an option. Not everyone works in an office.A workplace parking levy would be a totally unfair tax on those for whom public transport or working from home is simply not an option.As someone who is now retired I have no personal interest in this matter.David Clark, Tarbolton.* I AM afraid Patricia Fort makes a very poor argument in favour of workplace parking. Most main roads now have bus lanes which cause tailbacks of cars, more pollution and damage to the outside lane which takes all the weight of the traffic. Unused cycle lanes are even worse in this regard.At a time of massive increase in the cost of living, a workplace parking charge is the last thing we need. The money raised will not even be spent on roads, but likely on one of the SNPs obsessions which are usually only of interest to a minority.J Carr, Glasgow.SHOULD WE RESTRICT PERILOUS CHOICES I THANK William Durwardfor his observations on my musingson legalising currently illegal drugs. Funnily enough his comments about alcohol abuse actually make my point for me.It is indisputable that while the majority are moderate in their indulging, alcohol is abused by a signicant minority of the public to their detriment however, the wave of obesity sweeping the country indicates that availability of food is causing similar problems to those unable to control their gastronomic urges. Perhaps in their interests we should restrict access to fish suppers and other fast foods Mind you, I think Westminster’s austerity policies already have that matter in hand.David J Crawford, Glasgow.KEEN ON THE CAMBRIDGESI HEARTILY agree with Ian W Thomsonwhen he writes that Prince William already has a USP and goes on to say \"that is that he is not Prince Charles ... Prince Harry ... or Prince Andrew\".

The other two have been decent performances against Man City and Liverpool.“But we can’t forget we’ve come up against a decent team in Southampton.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

Bangor were able to stop the Hinch drag flick from the top of the circle.With Bangor on the front foot and looking to increase their lead they applied the pressure on lsquoHinch.

This was a warning sign of things to come as just moments later McCoubrey managed to put the ball into the net courtesy of the outside of his right boot after a scramble in the box.Again, Carryduff showed their resilience and still relied on their counterattacks, the latest coming from captain Conway, although his misjudged pass denied team-mate David Quigley a chance at goal.The pressure would continue to mount on the Carryduff back line and soon it was - as McCoubrey registered his second of the match mdash albeit through an unorthodox but neat finish.Celtic defender Blaine Connolly saw his effort fantastically thwarted by Carryduff lsquokeeper Leggett, who pounced to the bottom right corner of his net with a strong outstretched arm to deny further punishment.The weather began to give its input into the game as temperatures ped bitterly and the wind began to blow harshly at intervals.Although this cannot be cited as the determining factor in this contest by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly played its part when Carryduffrsquos Emmet Curran saw his through ball carried beyond its intended target.Carryduff did manufacture a rare breakaway and it looked asstriker Jonathan Wilkinson would open the away sidersquos account when a pass from midfield left him with just lsquokeeper Curran to beat.However, an impressive last-ditch tackle from defender Gary Carberry allowed the Celtic number five to hook the ball to safety, thus further frustrating the opposition.Celticrsquos Shaun Megahey saw his left-footed effort saved before Carryduffrsquos Joseph McBrien swept up the loose ball and in the last notable action of the half, Conway witnessed his lowly struck effort palmed away from danger by the Hoopsrsquo number one.As the second half kicked off, the home side showed no signs of relenting as they pushed for more goals.Conaill Kerr saw his point-blank effort superbly saved from six yards by lsquokeeper Leggett, who, despite the score line, made numerous contributions to prevent his side conceding into double figures.This over-eagerness from the hosts would cost them as they were caught short at the back, leaving Raymond Grant unmarked  yards from goal.The striker quickly picked his spot and unleashed a lovely curled effort into the top right hand corner to get his side off the mark.Unfortunately for Carryduff, this was as good as it got as Celtic replied almost immediately with McMahon grabbing his second of the matchafter rounding the lsquokeeper for an easy tap in.Things went from bad to worse for the away team when Stephen Galbraith slipped a pass into the path of team-mate Conaill Kerr, who made no mistake with his finish in the one-on-one scenario.At this point Carryduff were aiming for damage limitation but Celtic smelt blood. McMahon completed his hat-trick with an eye-catching acrobatic effort before McCoubrey, tapped in his third of the day.Hoops defender Carberry picked up a yellow card after some unsavoury words with the official and captain Michael Rice was left red-faced after midfielder Curran knocked the ball between his legs, but the home outfit didnrsquot let that deter them from their onslaught.Carberry atoned for his booking in the form of a late header from a Galbraith corner delivery to round off the scoring at -.After the match, hat-trick hero Sean McMahon gave his thoughts on his sidersquos resounding victory.ldquoIt was a good performance, he said. ldquoWe knew they only had  players so we had a good chance of winning but you have to play the  minutes and make sure you get the victory at the end of the day.ldquoWersquove put pressure on the league leaders, itrsquos good to score three goals but the main thing is to get the three points.He added: ldquoI donrsquot usually score headers so thatrsquos my pick of the goals for me.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, B Connolly, R Fitzpatrick, G Carberry, M Rice , B Treacy, C McCartan, S McMahon, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.

The Gill brothers, Gareth and Kyle, were among the replacements.Ballynahinch used the conditions superbly to burst into a lead they would not surrender.Playing with the wind, they pinned the students back with excellent tactical kicking and after missing an early long range penalty they went for the corner following a UCC offence at the breakdown and Kyle McCall burst from the edge of the maul to score.A great kick and chase moments later led to another penalty and another maul try for McCall. Greg Hutleyrsquos superb conversion took Ballynahinch  points clear after  minutes.The second quarter yielded only a single UCC penalty. Ballynahinch were not quite as accurate as they had been earlier in the game and small errors and indiscipline allowed UCC plenty of possession. However, excellent defence and long clearing kicks meant that the Ballynahinch line was never threatened.The second half was a scrappy affair and Ballynahinch began to fall foul of the referee at the breakdown.UCC kicked a long range penalty to close the gap to six points and missed another moments later as Ballynahinch struggled to put phases together into the wind. However, they sprung to le on  minutes and battled upfield where McCall was denied another maul try for a double movement.Following this disappointment UCC won a big scrum penalty and had the chance to kick to the corner to really turn the screw but misjudged the wind and kicked the ball dead. From the resulting scrum it was the away side who were celebrating as they won a penalty to relieve the pressure and settle the nerves.As the game entered the final quarter it was an error-strewn, stop-start affair, with injury stoppages and errors denying either side the chance to stamp any authority on proceedings.A mistimed Ryan Wilson tackle earned him a yellow card on  minutes and when UCC kicked the resulting penalty to close the gap to three points UCC were probably favourites.However, Ballynahinch produced an excellent spell of forward play with their maul continuing to be a very powerful weapon.They won a penalty from a maul on halfway and went for the corner, using up vital time on the sinbin and subjecting UCC to huge pressure deep in their .A solid scrum allowed Rory Butler the chance to go for the line where UCC gave away a penalty at the breakdown. Ballynahinch piled on the pressure, carrying hard at the line and desperate UCC defence led to another penalty and a yellow card for their replacement prop.The game was now there for the taking and following another big scrum on the UCC line Ballynahinch tried to put Conor Rankin over on the blind side.Multiple phases later UCC looked to have weathered the storm when they stole the ball and kicked clear. A superb chase saw Ballynahinch caught in possession but Cairns made an excellent arcing run to scythe through the cover and head for the line.He was tackled just short but the supporting Hutley was on hand to barge over, taking a knock in the process.He recovered to slot the conversion, sending Ballynahinch  points clear going intothe last five minutes and they saw out the game in relative comfort.Celebrations lasted long into the night and Ballynahinch have now put daylight between themselves and UCC.Third from bottom UCD arrive at Ballymacarn Park on Saturday to take on a rejuvenated local outfit who now have a snf of avoiding the relegation play-off.

One sat down while the other went up to the counter and asked for a bag of coins to be changed.As the men waited in the bank a Securicor delivery van arrived and a guard began leaving money bags into the bank.As the guard left a second bag into the bank one of the robbers produced a handgun and pushed him to the floor while the other vaulted the bank counter and grabbed the bags.Both men then left the bank and raced down the alleyway beside Irwinrsquos Superfoods to the red Sierra which was waiting, with a driver, at the entrance to the supermarket car park.The car sped off and was found on Sunday abandoned in a cul-de-sac off Hillfoot Crescent.CASTLEWELLAN ndash Mill bosses this week denied they plan to close the doors on a Castlewellan factory ndash less than three years after the plant was reopened.Speculation has intensied that Castlewellan Yarns, which is based in the former Moss Lane factory on the townrsquos Dublin road, is to be shut.The company is a ision of Linfield Group of textile-companies but a spokesman when asked about possible closure said this week: ldquoThat is not the situation at the moment. The Castlewellan plant was set up to do a specic job. It is having to compete head-on in a dficult world market at this time of depression.ldquoThere has been short-time working and we have operated at  per cent of capacity. Castlewellan is totally dependent on an upturn in the general linen market.The Linfield Group announced in  that it intended to commence production in Castlewellan. It said then it hoped to create up to  jobs in a poundm investment. However, employment levels have failed to reach this mark and the Ulster linen trade generally is currently experiencing one of it biggest slumps for a number of years.ARDGLASS ndash An assurance has been given that the long-awaited improvement package for Ardglass harbour will go ahead, despite a sizeable increase in cost projections.The chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Authority, Mr Ronan Fitzsimons, has said he is confident the work on the scheme will proceed, even though it is expected to cost substantially more than the Governmentrsquos pound.m budget.Work on the project, which involves extending the main pier by  metres and providing rock armouring at the back of the harbour wall, was expected to begin next month.But trawlermen, who have been campaigning more than  years for the scheme, were startled when it emerged late last week that tenders received were vastly above original estimations.It has been claimed that some of the tenders are up to pound, over the initial budget.Mr Fitzsimons said yesterday there would be a delay in the start date but denied rumours that the scheme is being put on ice indefinitely.ldquoThe start will have to be put back but there is no question of the project being ped, he remarked.STRANGFORD ndash The proposal to build a tidal barrage across Strangford Lough has been killed off ldquoonce and for all.Stormont Minister Richard Needham axed the plan because of the damage such a barrage would have caused to the sensitive environment of Strangford Lough.The announcement has been welcomed by environmentalists who described the Ministerrsquos attitude to the Lough as ldquovery positive and encouraging.Mr Needham made his announcement at the annual conference of the Royal Society for the Protection of birds and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy in Newcastle on Saturday.Opening the conference in the Slieve Donard Hotel, Mr Needham said the barrage proposal would no longer be merely shelved but would be dropped completely.ldquoIn the early rsquos there was a proposal to construct a barrage across the Narrows to allow the generation of electricity using tidal power, explained Mr Needham. ldquoAt that time, the proposal was examined from many viewpoints. On economic grounds it just did not measure up, and so it was shelved.ldquoThere is no doubt that the creation of a barrage would severely and irretrievably damaged the superb wildle of the Lough, altering the tidal regime, ruining feeding grounds, and in the process reducing muchthe scenic quality, said the Minister.KILLYLEAGH ndash A government minister is to be asked by Down councillors tomorrow to lt the embargo on marina development at Killyleagh.A deputation of councillors is hoping to persuade Economy Minister, Mr Richard Needham, to allow a marina development on the shores of Strangford Lough.The Minister will be told of the fears that Killyleagh is being turned into a ghost town because of substantial job losses in its industrial base ndash and the belief that a marina could hold out hope of a revival.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor. Mr Sam Osbourne, said ldquowhile we are meeting the Minister about the decision last August to refuse three separate applications for a marina, it goes much wider than that. There is a need for an overall plan for this town.ldquoThe whole place is badly run down and has probably never been at a lower ebb. Killyleagh is a ghost town now.

Improved disabled access is also part of the investment plan which will result in a number of paths being widened.Council officials say the planned improvements are essential for local people who are increasingly using the trails as part of their daily routine and commute.Since the start of the Covid pandemic, there has been a major increase in the number of people walking along the banks of the Quoile with this set to increase over the spring and summer.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Gareth Sharvin are delighted with the master plan and the benefit that it will provide for the town, its residents and visitors.Cllr Mason said due to Covid- restrictions, many areas across the district have experienced an increased use of outdoor spaces.ldquoThis has been so important for the health and wellbeing of residents and visitors to our area, she continued.ldquoThe Quoile in particular has been extremely busy with families and friends using the location for running, walking, cycling or simply meeting up with each other.

The design was rejected by the council.The campaign started last May when contractors turned up with equipment and portacabins and marked the trees for felling.Local resident Lily Devlin noticed the development and started the campaign, first rallying support via her Facebook page, and then starting an online petition.Speaking on behalf of the Save the Trees Campaign group, Cathie McKimm said: ldquoThe council got this wrong from the beginning.ldquoWe now have a situation where the council are applying for planning permission for a project they have already appointed contractors for and the project has increased by almost % in cost.ldquoIn bringing in experts to late at a huge cost to the ratepayer to fix the many mistakes theyrsquove made, including failing to include a drainage system in a flood risk area, the council are now having to contribute more than pound, to this scheme and growing, whereas before they were only contributing approximately pound, for the same scheme. ldquoGiven all the conflicts of interest that the council now have we do not believe they can assess this planning application objectively, and believe that the Department of Infrastructure needs to call it in and conduct a full investigation about how this has been handled.A council spokesman confirmed that a planning application for the project would follow regulations which apply to all councils throughout Northern Ireland in making its decision.He said: ldquoThe council will let matters follow due process, mindful of the procedures put in place by the Department for such planning applications.He also confirmed that the project, which was planned as a local tourism boost, had increased in costs.ldquoThe council has applied for and obtained funding of pound, towards the project.

Daffodils are peaking out of the ground, the weather is softening, and the feast of St Brigidrsquos Day , February , has passed.This can mean only one thing ndash lambs! In fact, lambs have been born in our practice since before Christmas. But the majority will be coming to a field near you over the next few weeks.Now, modern flocks have a lot of sheep in them. Indeed, there are about five million sheep in Ireland overall. Thatrsquos one for every man, woman and child.Our domestic sheepis descended from a primitive European ancestor, today found mainly in Corsica. In the past it was common for sheep to havejust one lamb. But today, thanks to better feeding, shelter and shepherding, it is possible for sheep to have twins, triplets and even quads!This abundance can come with problems though. Whata sheep doesnrsquot have enough milk to feed this many lambs  Well, farmers have come up with a number of solutions.The first is lsquopet lambsrsquo. These lambs are hand reared. They are fed with a bottle using condensed milk from commercial suppliers. Or the milk can be taken from another ewe who is producing a lot.As anyone with a baby will tell you, this solution is labour intensive and will keep the shepherd working around the clock. But they are dedicated, and they do it! It is not always sustainable in the long run. Another solution is fostering.Lamb fostering is where a ewe adopts the lamb from another ewe. The reasons for fostering can be manold. A lack of milk is one of the major reasons. The ewe may not want to take on another lamb, not recognising it as her own, but shepherds have adapted one of naturersquos many wonders to encourage it to happen.They use a technique called olfactory imprinting. Have you ever wondered how a ewe can recognise her own lamb in a flock of hundreds  One reason is that, just after birth, the ewe learns the smell of her newborn. This is what olfactory imprinting means.Shepherds can take advantage of this amazing process by rubbing some of the birthing fluid of the newborn lamb into the wool of the lamb to be fostered. The ewe will then accept the lamb as one of her own, and feed and care for it. The lives of many lambs are saved in this way.So when you next look at the fields of Lecale, check out the sheep and seeyou can tell them apart. Evenyou canrsquot, their mums can!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ulster Aviation Society left ‘dismayed’ over council at Festival of Flight decision  ","story":"THE decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to cancel this summerrsquos international Festival of Flight in Newcastle was taken without consulting one of its key partners, it has emerged.Last weekrsquos decision to pull the plug on the event mdash which was last held in  mdash was taken in secret during a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourist and Regeneration Committee.It is understood that no contact was made with the Ulster Aviation Society which has played a major role since the inaugural festival and described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.Council officials say that due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.Some councillors believe that given the local authorityrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades in Downpatrick and Newry are set to go ahead next month and with the further easing of Covid regulations, some form of airshow could have been organised for Newcastle this summer.This week, Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis urging the council to confirm that next yearrsquos festival will go ahead.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the airshow and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has urged the local council to ldquograsp the opportunity and organise an alternative event, suggesting a large scale festival that incorporates and builds on the most popular elements of the Festival of Flight.He is keen to see an event showcasing the regionrsquos ldquooutstanding food and drink offering with Newcastle a designated venue for arts, culture and music events to create opportunities showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering innovation of the district.Mr Burrows said while these were ldquoall excellent suggestions, he said as elements in addition to, or within, the Festival of Flight, surely not as a replacement for it.He continued: ldquoThat said, we would be pleased indeed to meet with the council or the mayor to discuss the matter. We want to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way how important our aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.ldquoThatrsquos exactly what did in recent years, before Covid.ldquoWe [the UAS] had probably the most popular exhibition within the ground-based event and thousands of parents have brought their children for photographs in our Spitfire and our Alouette helicopter, at no charge.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.Urging the local authority to confirm that it will be chocks away for next summerrsquos Festival of Flight, Cllr Lewis said that for the past two years, the organisation has been unable to deliver a tourism events programme due to the impact of Covid-.ldquoAlthough the possible impact of future Covid iants is dficult to predict, it is hoped that larger scale events can resume this summer.

Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight will not be going ahead.Cllr Lewis said the income that it would have generated would be a welcome boost to traders in the town and benefit the collective tourism industry across South Down.He continued: ldquoWe must not underestimate the huge draw of this annual festival. I note that council officers have said that throughout this past  months they had continued to engage with key stakeholders including the RAF.ldquoIt was advised that due to challenges planning the festival, securing air assets and the uncertainty of the pandemic that it has not been possible to host the festival of flight this year.Cllr Lewis revealed that he has been contacted by many aviation enthusiasts who are bitterly disappointed that the festival wonrsquot go ahead.He added: ldquoI fail to see how the event couldnrsquot have at least been planned for later in the year, now that we know the majority of restrictions are to be lted.

Photo: Stefan Rousseau PA WireThe invasion of Ukraine is a violation of a sovereign European democracy and a tragedy for millions of people who have been plunged into a maelstrom of suffering and oppressive uncertainty. Parents in Kyiv and Kharkiv put their children to bed on Wednesday night with hopeful promises that they would be safe. They have wakened on Thursday morning to the horror of Putin’s airstrikes and exchanges of gunfire. These are the people who will lose the most as the European continent stands on the precipice of a terrible conflict.What has happened in Ukraine demands the strongest possible response from the international community but particularly from our European partners. This is the greatest test of European Solidarity since the end of the second world war, but more than that, it is a test of our common humanity.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

He is at war, not just over territory ly claimed, but with the European values of coexistence and respect for dference and ersity. The political situation in the Donbas may be complex but the simple truth is that the tyranny of one is about to bring misery and suffering to millions.The sanctions brought to bear against Putin’s regime must go further than a small handful of oligarchs — it must be severe it must hurt Moscow and it must threaten his position. That also means dismantling the influence and power of money and political donations in London from iniduals close to the Russian state. The natural consequence of such action is that it will cause economic pain for us and other European states as well. This will not be easy but we must be prepared to shoulder some of the pain to ease the burden on the people of Ukraine. Every political party in Ireland should stand visibly and vocally in solidarity with them today. We must all be prepared to take the action necessary to end this invasion.Colum Eastwood, Foyle MP, SDLP leader ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It was silly, but to give Jimmy his due there was always a wee message in it, just like the work I do with the Gang today. “Always, each side of the community got an equal send up, again just like what we do with Give My Head Peace. It was all very even.“At that time I was still working in the court house for Antrim County Council because in those days, unless you were wealthy, actors could never afford to give up their day jobs. You were in the performing arts for the love of it.Olivia and her late husband Bill whom she married on June , . The couple went on to have one daughter, Patricia“I would come out of the court house like the clappers and get a bus up Royal Avenue to the Group Theatre. Sometimes we would do double shows for three weeks over Easter and over Christmas, but it was so much fun, you didn’t resent being so busy.“Every six months we changed the show, but when we would do two shows, the same people who were into theatre would be sitting there every single Saturday. People would come to the play at half six, go to John Long’s fish and chip shop for their tea and then sometimes be back in time for the second performance.”Olivia recalls that the love of her le, her late husband Bill, whom she met through the Larne Drama Circle, died of an aneurysm in .“Bill and I were always trying to get married, and I would say, ‘I’ll just do another play, Bill, and then we’ll get married.’ Olivia as a cherubic child. She began elocution lessons at the tender age of three and has been performing in one way or another ever since“We got married on June , , and got a flat, and we put every penny we got into it, and we just thought we were the bees’ knees. “Then in August of ‘ internment came in and absolutely everything stopped, the city went dark and the curtains came down in the theatres. No plays, nothing, and there was Bill and I sitting like two prunes, albeit in love.“There’s not a day goes by when I don’t miss him, but after his death I had to raise my daughter Patricia who was just ten then, and le had to go on. My love of acting sustained me.”She first joined Tim ‘and the boys’ on BBC NI’sPerforated Ulster and then came the call to join the cast of Give My Head Peace for what would go on to become the now iconic satirical series in  and ever since nobody has dared cross, or targe, the inimitable doyenne of the dramedy.‘I’M ACTUALLY VERY SHY OUTSIDE A ROLE’“At age three I was signed up to do elocution lesson,” says Olivia. “I was always used to standing up and speaking.“Basically though, and people may be very surprised by this, but I am actually very shy, and I hate going into rooms with people who I don’t really know, because I always think, ‘well why would they want to talk to me ’ “So I was always nervous, but I never had any qualms about going on stage and I always did a lot of public speaking.“At first, when I started to do it, I used to pretend that I was somebody , for about the first two minutes and that’s what got me through.“With drama you can be very shy, but when you take on a role you become somebody , and there’s a real liberation in that because you no longer feel self-conscious - you are transformed when you play a particular part.”Nash added: “When I left school, I joined Larne Drama Circle at the age of  and it was the making of me as a performer and to this day all of us are like family, my family outside my family - %.”‘IF YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH TOGETHER, THAT’S REALLY OVERCOMING DIVISION’Olivia, who starred in the iconic Billy Plays in the s alongside a very young Sir Kenneth Branagh and the late Jimmy Ellis, whom she remembers as an “absolute gentleman”, received her MBE in  not just for the rich tapestry of her theatre work but also for her uwavering support for the Northern Ireland Hospice for whom she has gone on innumerable fundraising walks and loves to visit to chat and entertain patients. She feels all of us could learn some perspective, namely “how to stop grumbling about things that don’t matter”, from witnessing the incredible work they do there.But today she feels blessed beyond measure, that besides working in radio which allows her to play a “tall, slim blonde” when she feels like it, she is delighted to be part of a show that frequently flags up the absurdity of our sectarian politics and entrenched, ludicrous ision where we could have unity and fraternity.”No disrespect to Stormont, butthe cast of Give My Head Peace had a half an hour up there, I think it would get politicians on both sides of the ide working together much better. “If I had a pound for all the times people stop me in the street and tell me how much Give My Head Peace made them laugh and upllted them, whatever circumstances they were going through, I would be very rich, and I feel very privilegedto have been allowed to be a part of something so wonderful, which I think very much shows that whether you are orange, green or neither, there is so much more that unites rather than ides us in Northern Ireland. “There is barely a day when somebody doesn’t shout out ‘Ma!’ to me in the street.”It’s obvious the gang are thick as thieves and Olivia tells an hilarious story about a programme special they did on the continent when she fell a*** over face into a freezer trying to retrieve some prawns, with a passerby having to pull her out by the ankles, which became comedy gold in one episode, and on a special set in Rome when they had the full humour of Uncle Billy wanting to meet the Pope.How does Ma keep Da in line, I wonder  “Oh that’s my secret,” laughs Olivia. “Da gives her a hard time, but, as in so many households, it all runs off Ma like water off a duck’s back.\u2028“You know I’ve a fabulous family, great friends and an acting career that allows me to do one of the most wonderful things, which is to make people laugh even in the midst of their own personal struggles and to be able to spread joy.“And to me the arts and comedy deserve more respect than they are often afforded, becauseyou can make people laugh together, that’s really overcoming ision.”‘IF I HAD A MAGIC WAND, I’D MAKE EDUCATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND INTEGRATED’Olivia, who calls Dame Judi Dench her ultimate acting inspiration, not only because of the incredible range that has allowed her to do everything from Shakespeare to the Bond franchise but also because she seems “so lovely” in interviews, recalls being repeatedly in trouble at school because she was simply born a very chatty and bubbly livewire.“I was at school in the days of the slap, as it were, and I had lots of them. I hold my hands up, I was always talking too much in class.”After joining Larne Drama Circle at  she was involved in so many dferent productions and drama festivals, appearing in comedies and plays like Brian Friel’s The Loves of Cass McGuire, Tea in a China Cup and even musicals. “Our church had a very strong music society and I cannot sing for peanuts. If I joined a choir, they would pay me to leave, probably. “But one year we did The Music Man I played Mrs Paroo. It was like speak-sing, you spoke it to the beat. We went to Waterford for the festival of light opera and I actually won a prize for best comedienne and to this day I can’t stop laughing about that or marvelling at how it actually came about. “The next year, we did Brigadoon, and I had a part as Meg Brockie, and one of her songs was My Mother’s Wedding Day, and I won a prize that year as well!”If Olivia had a magic wand and could change anything at all about Northern Ireland over night, she would like to see integrated education implemented here.“I remember growing up in Larne, being wheeled about with my friend in a buggy. She was a Protestant, and she was my best friend. Then, because I was a Catholic, she and I had to go to dferent schools when we got older, and I could never understand it.”Olivia added:“We should be together and everybody should be allowed to follow whatever religion they want to follow without it being a question of you being right and the other person being wrong, or anyone trying to impose their beliefs on anybody . “We need to have mutual respect for each other and I think integrated education is the way forward in trying to make that a reality.”See Give My Head Peace  on tour on March -, at the Market Place Theatre, Armagh March , at the Alley Theatre, Strabane March , at The McNeill Theatre, Larne March -, at the Riverside Theatre, Coleraine March , at the Strule Arts Centre, Omagh March -, at the Millennium Forum, Londonderry March , at the Theatre at the Mill, Newtownabbey March , at The Braid, Ballymena March -, at The Ardhowen Theatre, Enniskillen March -, at the Burnavon Theatre, Cookstown and March -April , at the Grand Opera House, Belfast.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The PAC report comes after the NI Audit Office last year raised concerns about how the fund was administered.Auditors criticised the failure to take applicants’ bank balances and reserves into account when allocating money.Auditor General Kieran Donnelly’s report last June highlighted how the largest grant of £. million was paid to Royal County Down Golf Club, which had a “very signicant bank balance and a high level of reserves”.The SSF was one of a number of schemes delivered by Stormont departments to help ious sectors deal with the financial implications of the pandemic.Of the £ million allocated, £. million was distributed across  sport governing bodies, including £. million to Ulster GAA, £. million to the IFA, £. million to the IRFU and £, to  other sporting governing bodies.Some £. million was distributed across  sports clubs.The grant awards were calculated by comparing the income and expenditure for the Covid- year with the average income and expenditure for the previous three years.However, there was no requirement in the scheme to consider the reserves or bank balances held by applicants and whether the losses incurred by the organisations would lead to the imminent risk of closure.The PAC has made  recommendations aimed at preventing a repeat of the errors.Chairman of the committee William Humphrey said: “As a committee, we were surprised that the department and Sport NI appeared to hand out monies to organisations that could have survived without funding or with much less funding.”The PAC report found that, due to the need to devise the scheme quickly, several flaws went unchallenged.It said the scheme allowed organisations to quanty their losses during Covid- without signicant investigation or challenge.“We found that the objectives of the SSF, to ensure that organisations across a range of sports would survive, were certainly admirable,” Mr Humphrey said.“However, the department and Sport NI did not devise a set of assessment criteria that they could apply to the applications they received.“This flawed approach meant that some large and very profitable organisations, such as golf clubs, were awarded monies that might have been better spent on smaller, more financially precarious groups.”He added: “We were surprised that the department and Sport NI believed that it was acceptable and value for money to award public funds to clubs and organisations that ensured they achieved the same profit as they had in previous years.“In a year where many organisations were struggling financially, providing taxpayers’ money to support the profits of sports clubs is something that should not have happened.“What is even more concerning is that neither the department nor Sport NI appeared to realise that this underwriting of profit would be the result of the way in which the scheme was designed.“In our evidence session, large grants to financially secure golf clubs were justied by helping to maintain the region’s position as a world number one golf destination.“We were alarmed at this interpretation of the scheme, since it was not designed as a tourism support scheme but rather a scheme to enable sporting organisations to weather the pandemic.“The committee understands that the SSF was developed quickly in response to the problems created by the pandemic and the scheme, as instituted, had signicant flaws.“We believe that it is crucial that all government departments learn from this and,such programme is required in the future, that more attention is paid to ensuring a fairer distribution of funds.”  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularWhat is NATO  What does NATO stand for, member states, is Ukraine in NATO -

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: WSPThe first option would see a segregated cycle and pedestrian path through an old railway line, from Cosmeston Drive in Sully to Railway Walk in Penarth. This would involve clearing out a lot of overgrown vegetation on the railway line, and could be an expensive option.The second option would see the existing pavement on Lavernock Road widened, for shared use between pedestrians and cyclists. The speed limit would be reduced from mph to mph along this part of Lavernock Road. This option would be the cheapest.The third option would combine parts of the first two. It would use the old railway line halfway, from Cosmeston Drive to St Mary’s Well Bay Road, before then crossing Lavernock Road and continuing on the pavement until Sully.The consultation website said: “There is a growing need to reform the way people travel between destinations using private vehicles. Providing good quality active travel infrastructure is an important component in negating the need for people to own vehicles.“Active travel infrastructure may also be used as a tool to improve physical and mental well being and mitigate the impact of private vehicles on the environment.“By providing one of these proposed route options, we can facilitate a modal sht from the private car to active modes for short distances to either Sully, Cosmeston and Penarth.”.removePeople interested in responding to the consultation have until March  to do so, by visiting the website: sullyactivetravelmonplace.is Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Stephen is passionate about pet nutritionHe said: “Traditional syrup-filled human pancakes would not be suitable for dogs as they contain salts, sugars and carbohydrates.“A dog can’t break down the fats and carbs like a human does. If eaten regularly, the result would generally be rapid weight gain which of course can lead to chronic conditions such as diabetes.“Also, more immediate issues may be seen in dogs with allergies, intolerances and particularly sensitive stomachs.”When is Pancake day This year pancake day falls on March . Otherwise known as Shrove Tuesday, it is the day before the start of Lent fasting practiced by Christians in the run up to the Easter festival.Pancakes are supposed to use up things like eggs, milk and sugar before the fasting begins.Dog-friendly pancake recipeStephen has designed a recipe especially for dogs to enjoy this Pancake Day, replacing common allergens like wheat flour and cow’s milk with dog-appropriate alternatives.The recipe can be found on the Ocado website, where you can also purchase the necessary ingredients.Ingredients:Step Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and ml of lukewarm water before whisking until the ingredients are fully combined.Step Heat a non-stick frying pan to a medium temperature then add a ladle of the pancake mixture to the pan.Step Cook the pancakes for  seconds on each side before removing from the heat and leaving to cool fully. Add your dog’s favourite toppings and serve.Tips for a healthy pancake day with your dogIf you’re going to celebrate Pancake Day with your dog, Stephen has three more top tips to ensure you’re prioritising your dog’s health:As always, make sure your dog has access to plenty of fresh clean drinking water.Adjust your dog’s daily feeds to account for the extra calorie intake.As with all treats, remember to serve these pancakes in moderation. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Because the world needs a free and sovereign Ukraine. pic ijbAAbG— Boris JohnsonFebruary , At a meeting of the United Nations Security Council in New York, Russia – as expected – used its veto to block a motion calling for Moscow to cease the attack and withdraw its troops.However there was disappointment in Western capitals that India and the United Arab Emirates joined China in abstaining, weakening the international show of opposition to Russia’s actions.And despite escalating economic measures, there was no sign they were having any impact on Mr Putin’s determination to pursue his military offensive against his neighbour which began on Thursday.Western officials expressed concern that Russia could deploy devastating thermobaric weapons, amid signs that its advance had been slower than planned in the face of stf Ukrainian resistance.The unprovoked and illegal assault on Ukraine is continuing.

I’ve strengthened our ban in the UK so that no Russian private jet can fly in UK airspace, or touchdown – effective immediately.— Rt Hon Grant Shapps MPFebruary , Britain’s Chief of Defence Intelligence, Lieutenant General Sir Jim Hockenhull, said their objective was to “secure control of the population and change the regime”.After President Putin appealed to Ukrainian troops to rise up against their leaders and cease fighting, Mr Johnson issued his own appeal to the Russian people.In a video posted on social media, he warned their country faced “complete isolation” as a result of their leader’s “needless and bloody war” which would mean many Russian soldiers “will never see their families again”.Speaking briefly in Russian, he said: “I do not believe this war is in your name.”At a virtual summit of Nato leaders on Friday, they agreed to send elements from the alliances ,-strong response force to protect members states in the east amid fears they could be the next target of Russian aggression.Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said it was clear the Kremlin’s objectives were “not limited to Ukraine” and that they would “do what it takes to protect and defend every ally and every inch of Nato territory”.“We are facing a new normal in European security where Russia openly contests the European security order and uses force to pursue its objectives,” he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK and US impose sanctions on Putin as the noose tightens around Kyiv article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe UK, US and the European Union announced plans to impose personal sanctions on President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in response to the Kremlin assault on Ukraine.It came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a chilling warning to the world about Russia, stating: “This is the night they will storm”.As Ukrainians continued to flee across the borders, Boris Johnson said he would be bringing forward measures “imminently”, while the White House and Brussels said they will freeze the assets of the two Russians.Britain said that it was also extending a ban of Aeroflot flights landing in the UK to cover Russian private jets favoured by Moscow’s oligarchs.At a meeting of the United Nations Security Council in New York, Russia – as expected – used its veto to block a motion calling for Moscow to cease the attack and withdraw its troops.To the people of Ukraine: Slava Ukraini.To the people of Russia: I do not believe this war is in your name.This crisis, this tragedy, can and must come to an end. Because the world needs a free and sovereign Ukraine. pic ijbAAbG— Boris JohnsonFebruary , The UK’s ambassador to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward called the veto “absurd” and said Russia was “isolated”, adding: “History will record how we voted today and which countries stood up to be counted in defence of the Charter and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.”There was disappointment in Western capitals that India and the United Arab Emirates joined China in abstaining, weakening the international show of opposition to Russia’s actions.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss also noted Russia’s isolation and called Moscow “a global pariah”..removeRussia is isolated at the UN Security Council as no country votes with them. They are a global pariah.Putins invasion of Ukraine and violation of the UN Charter will have severe consequences.👇 https:t.co clKJOhntJ— Liz TrussFebruary , “Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and violation of the UN Charter will have severe consequences,” Ms Truss added.And despite escalating economic measures, there was no sign they were having any impact on Mr Putin’s determination to pursue his military offensive against his neighbour which began on Thursday.Western officials expressed concern that Russia could deploy devastating thermobaric weapons, amid signs that its advance had been slower than planned in the face of stf Ukrainian resistance.The unprovoked and illegal assault on Ukraine is continuing. See below for an update from Defence Intelligence. #StandWithUkraine pic TwlnDxLCuV— Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧February , The so-called “vacuum bombs” suck in oxygen to create powerful, high-temperature explosions which can damage internal organs.“My fear would be thatthey don’t meet their timescale and objectives, they would be indiscriminate in their use of violence,” one official said.The latest intelligence update from the Ministry of Defence in London said Russian forces had made advances throughout Friday – with a probable amphibious landing in southern Ukraine around Mariupol.However the primary target remains Kyiv, with Russian forces advancing on “multiple axis” in an attempt to encircle the city.With reports of sporadic fighting in the suburbs, there are fears of heavy civilian casualties as the main body of Russian troops reach the capital.Putin’s actions are unlawful and anyone benefitting from Russia’s aggression in Ukraine is not welcome here. I’ve strengthened our ban in the UK so that no Russian private jet can fly in UK airspace, or touchdown – effective immediately.— Rt Hon Grant Shapps MPFebruary , Britain’s Chief of Defence Intelligence, Lieutenant General Sir Jim Hockenhull, said their objective was to “secure control of the population and change the regime”.After President Putin appealed to Ukrainian troops to rise up against their leaders and cease fighting, Mr Johnson issued his own appeal to the Russian people.In a video posted on social media, he warned their country faced “complete isolation” as a result of their leader’s “needless and bloody war” which would mean many Russian soldiers “will never see their families again”.Speaking briefly in Russian, he said: “I do not believe this war is in your name.”At a virtual summit of Nato leaders on Friday, they agreed to send elements from the alliances ,-strong response force to protect member states in the east amid fears they could be the next target of Russian aggression.Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said it was clear the Kremlin’s objectives were “not limited to Ukraine” and that they would “do what it takes to protect and defend every ally and every inch of Nato territory”.“We are facing a new normal in European security where Russia openly contests the European security order and uses force to pursue its objectives,” he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK and US impose sanctions on Putin as the noose tightens around Kyiv article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bfcdceabfaeae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbedacedef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have.
