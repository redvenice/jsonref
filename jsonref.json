This means they have not been included in the 1.7m figure.People with severely weakened immune systems are timing their third dose with their GP to give them the best possible immunity.This might mean waiting until finishing a course of medicine that prevent the vaccine from stimulating a good response. Meanwhile, health bosses have pleaded with Britons to come forward for their Covid boosters, which will be administered at the same time as the annual flu shot where there is plenty of supply. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid, said: \u0027This year we are rolling out the largest flu vaccine programme in our history, alongside the new COVID-19 booster vaccine rollout both are important to provide vital protection not only to yourself, but also your loved ones while also helping to ease pressure on the NHS.\u0027The COVID-19 vaccine programme is a fantastic example of how successful vaccination programmes can be – with around 130,000 lives saved. It is vital we continue that incredible progress with all those eligible ensuring they get both their flu and COVID-19 booster injections as soon as they are invited.\u0027Officials have said they do not expect the same rush for booster jabs as they initially saw when the vaccines were first rolled out.Experts have reiterated that two doses are the most vital for protection. The third boosts and extends the duration of immunity.Data from Israel suggests a booster shot slashes the risk of infection by 11 times and makes people up to 20 times less likely to need hospital care, compared to someone who had their second dose six months ago.Doses of the Pfizer jab, or a half dose of Moderna, are being administered as boosters in the UK, even if someone originally had AstraZeneca. For those who cannot get either of those two mRNA jabs, such as due to an allergy, they will be given a dose of AstraZeneca\u0027s vaccine. A half dose of Moderna has been chosen because it was found to have fewer side effects but similar efficacy."},{"url":null,"title":"UKs daily Covid cases rise month high Infections 12 week 40 701","story":"Share this articleGuidance saying all children should wear coverings in classrooms and corridors was dropped in mid-May as part of No10\u0027s drive to learn to live with the virus.But ministers have made contingency plans in the event of a rapid surge in cases among pupils.  Nadhim Zahawi defended the potential measures, which includes coverings, increased pupil and staff testing and shielding vulnerable pupils. He insisted his priority was to \u0027protect education\u0027 and keep schools open. Meanwhile, Mr Zahawi also said he doesn\u0027t want to bring back bubbles, which saw entire classes and year groups sent home if one child tested positive. Original coronavirus-fighting measures deployed in English schools contributed to 1.1million children being stuck at home during the most disruptive days of the Covid pandemic.Ministers said dropping face masks would improve interactions between teachers and pupils, while ending bubbles would ease disruptions to education. Government guidance published in August said some measures could be brought back to manage local outbreaks, respond to variants of concern or prevent the NHS from becoming overwhelmed.Local health chiefs can implement the measures in the response to outbreaks.  Face masks are already in use at schools in parts of the South West, Cumbria and Northamptonshire.But current restrictions only require school children to test themselves for the virus twice a week using a lateral flow device. Cases have exploded to record-highs in children since schools went back, with 1.5 per cent of youngsters aged 10 to 14 testing positive in the week ending October 1. However, Government data suggests infections have started to fall among children over the most recent four days.  Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said: \u0027Thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children — 99 per cent of schools are open.\u0027Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about 90 per cent, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates.\u0027But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open.\u0027But Mr Zahawi revealed he was not looking to return to the bubble system to do so, \u0027because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children\u0027.He did not, however, rule out the return of the wearing of masks in the classroom in England.He said: \u0027We\u0027ve got a contingency plan, as you would expect me to do... it contains lots of contingencies, including masks, absolutely.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"LGBT advocacy groups blast Dave Chappelle transphobic gags new Netflix special","story":"Share this articleDave Chappelle defends J.K.

The move to make travel easier follows the government announcement on Thursday that the number of countries on the “red list”, which have the toughest restrictions, is to be cut to only seven. Addressing plans for a shift in policy on testing, Shapps said: “We want to get this done for half-term for people. “When it comes to the safety aspect, we are still requiring a test,” Shapps said, speaking on Sky News. “But we are going to move that down from being a PCR one, an expensive one that you have to send away to a lab, to a lateral flow test, so that will help and enable us to monitor things. We anticipate having it ready for the half-term. What a difference it will make for people.” Despite soaring numbers of positive coronavirus cases, Shapps said the government has the confidence in downgrading the level of tests for foreign travel because of the vaccination programme. Read more of Mark Sweney’s report here: Grant Shapps wants to scrap costly PCR tests for travellers by half-term There were 27,246 new cases recorded, just shy of yesterday’s total 27,550, which itself was also a record high.See it here: ‘We just need food’: Manila’s newly homeless tell stories of survival in lockdown – photo essay Olzhas Auyezov for Reuters has some quotes this morning attributed to EU ambassador Markus Ederer, who has told Russian media outlet RosBusinessConsulting: “This is a technical rather than a political process. When Russian officials talk about the process being delayed and politicised by the European side, I sometimes think they are largely referring to themselves because it is them who makes this about politics.” Ederer said that Russia has repeatedly delayed inspections by the necessary for the certification. Russia has accused the West of refusing to certify its main vaccine for political reasons, and that this makes it harder for Russians to travel. Russian health minister Mikhail Murashko said this month that all the barriers to register Sputnik V with the World Health Organisation have been cleared and only some paperwork remained to be completed.He told various UK media outlets that the government was hoping to have the change in place before half-term in October – which starts in England in most schools on Friday 22 October. He suggested people hold off from booking PCR tests with their holidays, as the cheaper lateral flow test option would be available. Shapps said he hoped that travellers returning to the UK could be “done and dusted” with organising testing before they even get home, with lateral flows set to be made available at airports. He also told Times Radio that he hoped that by next summer, international travel would be testless.PA report he told BBC Breakfast said: “If it’s positive, you’ll automatically receive a PCR test, you’ll be in the NHS system, as with the normal test and trace, so you’ll get the PCR without having to do anything further, and of course, be asked to isolate. “If it’s negative, that’s it, you’re free to go, and the good thing is that can either be done, as I say, as soon as coming through the gates, potentially, at some airports where they might offer that, or you may have ordered a test to be at your home. “You carry out that test, we’re going to ask people to take a photograph of it so that it’s actually your test. And that’s it, the job is done, there’s nothing further to do. So it’s going to be a much simplified, much cheaper system.” Questioned how authorities could be sure the photographed test belonged to the right person, Shapps said: “Well, look, you could always say this with any system, the PCR system that’s been in place up until now hasn’t required any monitoring at all. So you could always make that argument. We have throughout this crisis, though, I think relied on people’s common sense, I think most people wanted to do the right thing.”Hospitals in Papua New Guinea are being pushed to the brink and morgues are overflowing, as the country suffers what health authorities say is the worst surge in Covid-19 cases since the pandemic began. The country’s health care system has long been plagued by shortages of drugs, funding, an ailing infrastructure and a severe lack of health workers. Now, major hospitals around Papua New Guinea have been forced to scale down vital medical services while at least one says it may be forced to close altogether. As of Wednesday, the country has recorded a total of 21,896 Covid cases and 243 deaths over the course of the pandemic, according to the National Department of Health. The latest available breakdown shows a surge in cases, rising to 600 in the week beginning 20 September from 255 four weeks earlier. Deaths rose from two to 17. However, these figures may not reflect the severity of the outbreak due to the country’s low testing rate.

Many parents who contacted the  in response to a call-out about the Covid vaccine programme for 12- 15-year-olds were still waiting to hear when their child might be vaccinated, their schools left often in the dark too. Bueno said: “The school sent a message earlier this week asking parents to stop asking the school for information on when the vaccination programme will commence as they hadn’t received any information on it yet. “I would like my daughter to be vaccinated as soon as possible as the number of cases in the community are still very high. My son had Covid a few weeks ago after an outbreak in his class. So I’m in fear she will be next.” An ITU nurse in Suffolk was similarly worried. “My daughter was due to have her vaccine at school last week. Thanks to the fuel crisis, explained away as ‘unforeseen circumstances’, that didn’t happen, and the vaccinations have been cancelled until further notice. “Over a third of my daughter’s classmates have now tested positive via lateral flow tests and are now isolating. I worked in ITU over the height of the second wave, and having seen the very worst of the pandemic I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemies.” Read more of our education correspondent Sally Weale’s report here: ‘I’d like to get my daughter vaccinated soon – I fear she will be next to get Covid’ On the former he confirmed that the government is intending to reduce the testing requirements for travel from a PCR test down to a lateral flow test, and were aiming to do so before school half-term in England, which is a couple of weeks away. He said: Shapps also touted that the US government was on course to ease travel restrictions from the UK to the US in November, and was keen to state that the UK government has also now recognised the vaccination programmes of an additional 37 countries, making travel easier for people coming to the UK. On flu booster jabs he said: Authorities had earlier said booster shots would not be compulsory but were highly recommended for those in vulnerable and high-risk groups. Panama, meanwhile, has said it is purchasing 3m additional doses of the Pfizer vaccine against Covid-19 for its inoculation efforts next year.Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, admitted he had no idea how many 12- to 15-year-olds in the UK had had their jabs, with early figures suggesting the government has little hope of hitting its target of vaccinating them all by half-term The government set half-term as a target for what ministers hoped would be a speedy rollout in schools, but with just over two weeks to go until the autumn break, anxious parents have told the  they are seeing Covid infections rise in their children’s school but have still not been given a vaccination date.

Experts fear the coming flu season could be particularly deadly because the population will have lost much of its immunity to the virus and have warned of up to 60,000 deaths. It will be the first winter the country faces with Covid and flu circulating at the same time. Read the full story here:  The World Health Organization finalised a clinical case definition for post-Covid-19 condition, often called Long Covid. The definition states that symptoms appear within three months of infection, last for at least two months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction. They may appear following recovery from acute-stage Covid-19, or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate over time. “This standardised definition will help clinicians to identify patients more easily and provide them the appropriate care, and is crucial for advancing recognition and research,” director-general of the World Health Organization Tedros said. Here is a round-up of all the day’s leading stories. US president Joe Biden has talked up vaccine mandates, saying the unvaccinated have “put our economy at risk”.  Speaking in Illinois on Thursday, he said: “vaccination requirements are good for the economy” and called on more business owners to enact them.

They meet once a month after nominations close on 31 January each year, counselled by a group of permanent advisers and other experts. They try to reach a consensus, but if they can’t then their decision is by majority vote.According to the will of the Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, who founded the awards, the prize should go to the person “who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses”.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine.

More than two-thirds of respondents to the poll (68 per cent) agreed that the President was “right to decline the invitation”. Just 17 per cent said that he “should have accepted the invitation”, while 15 per cent expressed no opinion.Last month President Higgins turned down an invitation from a group of church leaders to attend the event later this month in Armagh. The churches have insisted that the occasion is not a celebration of partition, but a ceremony to mark and reflect on the events of 100 years ago when partition brought about the founding of Northern Ireland. They stressed the event was to be intended to promote understanding and reconciliation.President’s reservationsBut Mr Higgins, citing fears that the event had become “politicised”, declined the invitation, arousing considerable controversy. Unionist leaders criticised and expressed disappointment at the decision. Queen Elizabeth has also been invited and is expected to attend, while the Government decided yesterday to send the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney to represent it at the event.Support for the President’s decision is highest among older age groups, with 74 per cent of those over 50 agreeing with him, against just 54 per cent of those aged 18-24.Supporters of Fine Gael (19 per cent) and Labour (20 per cent) were most likely to say he should have attended the event.Wealthier voters were slightly more likely to support his decision than voters who are less well off.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion poll pandemic bonus short lived for coalition","story":"National Development Plan launch: Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath and Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan.

(They were all still men, though, but the years of a male-only shortlist are surely numbered.) However, in what Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, likes to call the Game of Thrones, the selection of Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the First Sea Lord, goes beyond primus inter pares.Britain’s military strategy, for the next decade at least, will focus on the Royal Navy and the “tilt” to the Indo-Pacific. That is not to deny the relative capabilities of the other services (although the Army, in particular, faces big problems with re-capitalisation). It is also not a blinkered obeisance to the two new aircraft carriers, impressive as they are. It is, instead, an acknowledgement that Britain aspires to a greater role in world affairs after two decades pursuing the chimera of liberal intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. That requires a maritime strategy, incorporating, but not limited to, the military. The Government’s recent Integrated Review (IR) of defence, security and foreign policy pointed Britain in this new direction.Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy in East Asia at King’s College London, said at its heart the IR sees state-on-state competition as “the fuel behind international relations”.That matters to the Government because it is the current thinking in Washington.“If we’re serious about being forward-leaning, we need to use the maritime space as a launching pad for engaging with others,” Mr Patalano said. “The Navy is part of the broader tools of statecraft.”The Government views the Indo-Pacific region as the key area to shape future global competition, important in resisting China’s attempts to undermine the international rules-based order.Military power, as a tool of the statecraft needed to meet these challenges, will be designed in the medium term to bolster the threat from states, not terrorists.The Navy will play a central role in making Britain’s Armed Forces more mobile, forward-deployed and engaged with allies.It’s about “places not bases” and exercising in new areas. In short, turning up and being seen by allies to care about the region. As one US general put it, “virtual presence means actual absence”. Adm Radakin’s stewardship of the Royal Navy chimed with the Government’s desire for a renewed British military presence around the world.The forging of new partnerships through the ongoing deployment of the Carrier Strike Group to the Indo-Pacific region is a practical example of Britain’s new military posture.Adm Radakin’s personality is suited to furthering that strategy.In an interview with the Wavell Room, a military think tank, he described himself as inquisitive, keen to learn and curious about the world. He said optimism was “a fundamental trait of leadership”.These characteristics will be tested by a revanchist and belligerent Russia in Europe and a perpetually (perhaps willingly) provoked China in the east. “It feels to me that it is hard to be a pessimistic leader,” Adm Radakin said. He said even if a situation looked grim it was a leader’s responsibility to say “this is a noble and selfless thing to do, and we’re going to do it”.His tenure as CDS could well be judged on those words.More from NewsUS warns Russia against using gas supplies as \u0026#39tool of coercion\u0026#39 against EuropeDaily meat consumption falls by 17pc in a decade in effort to reduce methane emissionsTravel red list slashed to just seven countriesGet your flu vaccine early even if you\u0026#39re not vulnerable, urges Government scientistHow to show proof of Covid vaccination for travel abroadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"liz truss boris may have created force powerful realises","story":"For an American pollster, Frank Luntz has long held an unusual amount of influence over British politics. He once convened a focus group in the Churchill Room of the Carlton Club which identified the then-outsider David Cameron as the next Tory leader – his experiment was televised and transformed the debate. So when Luntz joined a Spectator panel at Tory conference earlier this week, I asked him to test the mood of the audience: if not Boris, then who? To my surprise, the clear answer was Liz Truss.For some time now, Rishi Sunak has been seen as the obvious alternative. He has been the bookmakers’ favourite since he responded so quickly to the pandemic with a furlough scheme that has become the envy of countries such as the United States.Now, Sunak is the face of tax rises. He had to spend his time at Tory conference explaining why higher National Insurance is better than higher national debt. He’s right, but both options are resented by his party. Things might get worse yet, with the Prime Minister refusing to rule out more taxes.No such worries haunt Liz Truss, who spent Tory conference revelling in her new status as Foreign Secretary and posing for selfies with her army of admirers.They see her as refreshing, entertaining, perhaps a bit naughty – but, at heart, a Conservative who actually believes in conservatism at a time when others, when tested, have faltered. To find where she was speaking at Tory conference, you just needed to look for the rooms with the longest queues. To many, she is the keeper of the Thatcherite flame (she had a lifesize cutout of the former prime minister at one birthday party).The Lizmania will sound absurd to those Tories who see her as a trivial Instagram poseur with a weakness for innuendo and pop music references. She is certainly more likely to quote Destiny’s Child than Homer.A few days ago, she toasted an Australian trade deal by saying that the new partnership would bring the countries “even closer” than “the great romance between Kylie and Jason” on Neighbours. At a party thrown by free-market think tanks, she said she had come “to be reinfected with a bit of sound thinking”. Tory activists lap all of this up, loving her general tone of cheeky insurgency.There will be no revolution, no coup and no vacancy. Conservatives like power and will follow anyone who brings it: Boris Johnson personally won over Northern voters and without him they’d be sunk, even now. So the party faithful applaud when he says that higher taxes were needed after the “meteorite” of Covid.But they know the other meteorite is Johnson’s own decision to finance the nursing home costs of wealthy families – thereby forcing taxes to a 70-year high. From choice, not necessity.“Did we really go through all of this to become a high-spending European social democracy?” asks one minister. A fair point, and it explains why Truss backed Remain. She said at the time that Brexit was a distraction from her goal of lower taxes and a more free society. Brexiteers were naive, she thought, to think all of this would inevitably follow leaving the EU. She may yet be proved right. But she was strategic enough to keep very quiet during the campaign: now, she’s a born-again Brexiteer.She has also kept up her own fights inside government, to the further delight of her fans. Dominic Raab was asked during the Tory conference why, as a self-identifying low-tax Tory, he won’t use his Cabinet influence to argue against the splurges. What’s said in Cabinet tends to leak, he replied.He’s right, which is why history records that Truss was one of the few voices to confront the Prime Minister over the National Insurance increase. Better to load the national debt and rely on growth, she argued, than weigh the economy down with tax rises and renege on a manifesto pledge.This isn’t the first time Johnson has disappointed her on tax. When she joined his leadership campaign she brought with her a plan to ensure no one would pay the higher-rate threshold until they earned £80,000 (up from £50,271). Johnson was all for it at first, but then changed his mind. It’s not hard to imagine how the crowd in Manchester this week would have lapped up this idea. Even now Truss can give them a wink and suggested that, if she had her way, it might yet happen.Her other conflicts have brought her up against agricultural protectionists, who her allies jokingly refer to as the “axis of evil”. Members tend to include Michael Gove, George Eustice and Zac Goldsmith.These are the so-called Waitrose Tories, who stand in contrast to Truss’s Lidl Tories who want free trade and low prices. This has become a Truss trademark: she likes doing things on a budget.Being the heir apparent is usually a curse in the Tory party. Sunak will not have enjoyed this status: it means his every word (and any resistance he puts up to No 10) would have been scanned for Blair-Brown style rivalry. He’d doubtless be delighted to see the spotlight move to Truss, who would bask in it.In many ways, she is Johnson’s creation. He likes her boosterism, remembers her early support for him and has kept her safe from jobs where she would have to put her low-tax ideals to the test (or, as in Sunak’s case, to the slaughter).But some around him are beginning to wonder if he might have created a force more powerful than he realises. When she accompanied him on his recent trip to New York, just days into her role as Foreign Secretary, she waited for a clear run and walked down the runway red carpet with a confidence that unnerved some in No 10. “Those kinds of photos are supposed to be reserved for the Prime Minister,” said one of his allies.It’s too much to say that Johnson has created a rival. But there will be hard times ahead for him, especially if a cost-of-living crisis this winter forces him to adopt a more sombre tone. He may well find that, if this happens, there is someone ready and primed to take over as optimist-in-chief.More from NewsUS warns Russia against using gas supplies as \u0026#39tool of coercion\u0026#39 against EuropeDaily meat consumption falls by 17pc in a decade in effort to reduce methane emissionsTravel red list slashed to just seven countriesGet your flu vaccine early even if you\u0026#39re not vulnerable, urges Government scientistHow to show proof of Covid vaccination for travel abroadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"natwest admits money laundering offences","story":"NatWest has become the first high street bank to admit money laundering offences after allowing a small jewellery firm in Bradford to deposit hundreds of millions of pounds in cash over a three-year period.The bank, which is still more than half-owned by the taxpayer, now faces fines that could top £300 million, following a lengthy investigation into its dealings with Fowler Oldfield Ltd, a bullion dealer and jewellery business, which had its headquarters on an industrial estate in West Yorkshire.The company, which can trace its origins back to a jewellery stall in Bradford in 1897 and had been a familiar fixture in the city’s high street for more than a century, was closed in 2016 following a police raid.Fowler Oldfield, which specialised in bullion dealing, had a predicted annual turnover of £15 million a year, but deposited £365 million, including £264 million in cash over a three-year period.At one stage, the company was depositing £1.8 million a day, but NatWest failed to monitor and prevent the alleged money laundering.A total of 15 people with connections to the Bradford business have been charged in relation to the alleged laundering offences.A number of other people have also faced criminal charges after being accused of acting as couriers to move cash around the country.Among those who are due to go on trial next year at Leeds Crown Court are James Stunt, the bullion dealer who used to be married to the Formula One heiress, Petra Ecclestone.His Mayfair offices were raided by police in 2016 shortly after the Fowler Oldfield investigation was launched.Gregory Frankel, the great-grandson of the founder of the Bradford jewellery firm, is also awaiting trial.Mr Frankel, who was a director of Fowler Oldfield, was also vice president of Stunt \u0026amp Co. He and Mr Stunt also had a joint venture which sold gold and silver bullion on the international markets.The investigation into NatWest’s handling of the deposits by Fowler Oldfield was led by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).It is the first time a financial institution has been prosecuted under anti-money laundering laws in the UK.The bank, which was rescued by the taxpayer in a £45 billion bailout during the financial crash in 2008, admitted three offences under the Money Laundering Regulations of 2007, namely that it had failed to adequately monitor a customer’s account between 2012 and 2016.Clare Montgomery QC, prosecuting, told Westminster Magistrates’ Court that the firm’s deposits far outstripped the size of business.She said: “The turnover of Fowler Oldfield was predicted to be £15m per annum.  It was agreed that the bank would not handle cash deposits. However, it deposited £365m, with around £264m in cash.”She said at its height, Fowler Oldfield deposited up to £1.8 million a day.NatWest chief executive Alison Rose, pictured above, said: “We deeply regret that NatWest failed to adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers between 2012 and 2016.“NatWest has a vital part to play in detecting and preventing financial crime and we take extremely seriously our responsibility to prevent money laundering by third parties.”The bank said that it was told the FCA will not take action against any current or former employee of NatWest over the matter.On the potential fine facing NatWest, Ms Montgomery said: “The appropriate harm figure is going to be around £170 million, with a multiplier of 200 per cent.”Paul Goldspring, the chief magistrate, said the figures involved were too large to be dealt with by the magistrate court, and sentencing will take place at Southwark Crown Court on or before December 8.More from NewsUS warns Russia against using gas supplies as \u0026#39tool of coercion\u0026#39 against EuropeDaily meat consumption falls by 17pc in a decade in effort to reduce methane emissionsTravel red list slashed to just seven countriesGet your flu vaccine early even if you\u0026#39re not vulnerable, urges Government scientistHow to show proof of Covid vaccination for travel abroadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"never has campaign self defeating insulate britain","story":"If the police won’t, or can’t, because of loony woke protocols, the rest of us will do it instead. So, earlier this week a bunch of burly blokes removed Insulate Britain criminals from the middle of Wandsworth Bridge, and waved the cars through. Good on ‘em. I punched the air as I watched the clip.Has any protest group ever matched Insulate Britain for achieving something so counter-productive, in double-quick time? They appear to have united and radicalised the country against them far more efficiently than their cousins at Extinction Rebellion. Nobody had heard of them until about three weeks ago. Now the very name makes people want to rip out their loft insulation. In fact, polling shows that the more we know about the group, the less supportive we become. Nearly 50 per cent of people say they oppose their efforts, with just 27 per cent in support. Well done, chaps.And when we’re not spitting with rage, we’re rolling on the floor laughing. Insulate Britain is a source of endless comedy gold, with spokespeople swinging from the aggressive and the hopeless to the bizarrely unhinged. Take Liam Norton, who was forced to admit on live TV that he hasn’t even insulated his own home – at which point he walked off the set in a gigantic huff. One day he’ll stop digging.What’s even more risible is that much of the country already agrees that we should insulate more homes, and that we must get on with it. So, why’s Insulate Britain banging on? They might as well sit on the M25 demanding the abolition of workhouses, press gangs and child chimney sweeps.For heaven’s sake, the government’s Energy Company Obligation means that bigger energy companies are already obliged to offer free insulation or grants – sometimes worth up to 100 per cent of the cost – to help low-income households. And while the Green Homes Grant voucher scheme had its challenges, it led to many thousands of homes being upgraded, all on the tax-payer, with huge savings for owners.By the end of last year, more than 14 million properties had cavity wall insulation (that’s 70 per cent of relevant properties), and nearly 17 million had loft insulation (66 per cent of those with a loft). This is a big advance on a decade ago, and especially praiseworthy since 40 per cent of all homes in England and Wales were built before the war. It’s quite a big job to update them all, you know.Of course, Insulate Britain says it needs to happen more quickly. But by far the best, and certainly the most ethical, way to further that cause is by using law-abiding means of persuasion. Campaigners against smoking in pubs didn’t need to block motorways to achieve their objective, nor those in favour of no-fault orce, or those wanting to leave the EU. It’s just wrong to suggest that the only way for a campaign to make an impact is to engage in criminal, harmful activity. Perhaps Insulate Britain prefers virtue-signalling to meaningful change.“Aggressors should never succeed and law should prevail over the use of force”, said Margaret Thatcher. As usual, she was bang on, and her words are as apt today. If the government is serious about tackling these highway-blocking criminals it shouldn’t just ensure that the punishment fits the crime, preferably involving prison, but should call a halt to all government-funded home insulation until the motorway blockages cease. That’ll show the lawbreakers they’ll harm their own cause even more by continuing their campaign of misery.And the alternative? Why, any old group, with any old bee in its bonnet, will have every incentive to bring the country to a standstill. Come to think of it, I’ve long thought litter louts should receive instant £500 fines.

There are also growing fears the US will maintain its ban on British holidaymakers until Thanksgiving at the end of November.It\u0027s not that they (the US) don\u0027t want to do it. It\u0027s actually that in many ways they don\u0027t have the kind of level of sophistication in place on international travel that has become normal to us, Mr Shapps told Times Radio. For example, they don\u0027t actually have a Covid certification like the NHS app, it\u0027s a piece of paper. So you might say well, why does that matter to Brits going over there? Well again, they just don\u0027t have a system set up to read the NHS barcode or to be able to recognise other people\u0027s tests.Mr Shapps succeeded in killing off Department of Health proposals for fully jabbed travellers to video themselves taking lateral flow tests while supervised by a health adviser from a private firm.Holidaymakers will now only be required to send a picture of their test kit result, possibly with ID such as a passport.Travellers will have to book their tests before flying, as happens now with PCRs, and include the test kit number on the passenger locator forms which allow people into the UK.The Department of Health and Social Care will be responsible for getting the new testing system in place by the start of the half term on Oct 23. Sources said it would be ready by the time families started to return at the end of October at the latest.We want to get this done for half term for people, Mr Shapps told Sky News on Friday, adding that the process with lateral flows will be much much easier, much less expensive as well. Asked when an announcement can be expected, he said: In the coming days.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said: “Our robust border measures have helped protect the phenomenal progress of our vaccination programme, and it is because of this success both here and around the world that we can safely open up travel further and we can visit friends and family abroad.“We’re now making it easier and cheaper for people to travel by allowing fully vaccinated travellers from non-red list countries to use lateral flow tests on day two of arrival, as long as they provide proof of use.”The Government also announced it would recognise vaccines for arrivals from a further 37 countries and territories including Brazil, Ghana, Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Turkey.The decision means fully vaccinated people entering England from these locations will be exempt from quarantine, the pre-departure test and the day-eight post-arrival test.Only unvaccinated travellers now have to take a pre-departure test and then quarantine for 10 days on their return and pay for PCR tests on days two and eight of their return. The pre-departure test for double jabbed travellers was ditched on Oct 4.The latest moves follow the Foreign Office lifting its “ban” on non-essential travel to 32 countries including Fiji, Malaysia and Bangladesh. This ends the anomaly where its advice is out of kilter with the transport department’s travel lists.More from NewsNobel Peace Prize for journalists who angered Putin and DuterteUS warns Russia against using gas supplies as \u0026#39tool of coercion\u0026#39 against EuropeDaily meat consumption falls by 17pc in a decade in effort to reduce methane emissionsGet your flu vaccine early even if you\u0026#39re not vulnerable, urges Government scientistHow to show proof of Covid vaccination for travel abroadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watering planning reforms government betraying generation","story":"It is ironic that a party conference built around semi-funny variations on the “Build Back Better” theme – Build Back Batter, Build Back Beaver, Build Back Burger – culminated in a promise to clamp down on building. “Build Back Barely” would have been a more honest slogan. At the Conservative Party conference, both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the new Housing Secretary Michael Gove signalled their willingness to put the government’s controversial planning reforms on hold. They will probably resurface at some point, but if past experience is anything to go by, they will be watered down so heavily that one might as well just not do it at all. The government has once again caved in to pressure from anti-housing NIMBY obstructionists, and by siding with the NIMBYs again, they have thrown the younger generations under the bus. Never mind the terrible economics of this move: this is also, from their own perspective, an incredibly short-sighted electoral strategy. Conservatism, small-c or large-C, is already toxic with Millennials and Generation Z. For now, this may not matter to Conservatives, because it is cancelled out by solid support among Baby Boomers. But the generational composition of the British electorate is changing rapidly. The combined share of Millennial and Zoomer voters rises every year, as more Zoomers reach adulthood, but the share of Boomer voters can only go one way. A peculiarity of the Millennial generation is that, unlike previous generations, they show no signs of becoming more conservative or more moderate as they get older. Political attitude surveys show remarkably little difference between the typical attitudes of somebody in their late teens, and somebody in their early 40s. Since the first outbreak of “Corbynmania” six years ago, a lot of commentators have wondered where this sudden (yet stubbornly persistent) appetite for socialist ideas among Millennials came from. This is a very long story, but Britain’s housing crisis plays an essential role in it. The IEA’s polling, summarised in my report Left Turn Ahead?, shows that 80 per cent of millennials blame Britain’s housing crisis on “capitalism”. These people are feeling ripped off (and who can blame them), and they are generalising from that experience. They blame “capitalism” as a whole, rather than specific features of the British housing market.But the British housing crisis really is that: a specifically British crisis, not a general crisis of “capitalism” or any other-ism. Over the past quarter-century, house prices in the UK have increased by almost 180 per cent in real terms. The equivalent figure for the US is 70 per cent, the OECD average is 60 per cent, and the eurozone average is 50 per cent. Relative to population size, we build far fewer homes than comparable countries, we have been doing so for decades, and as a result, we now have a much smaller housing stock. There is plenty of empirical evidence from around the world which shows that regulatory supply-side restrictions are the key driver of housing costs. Evidence for Britain suggests that planning constraints explain more than a third of the average house price. The government’s planning reform proposals were not far-reaching enough to fully solve that problem. But they would have turned the system into a more rules-based one, in which planning permission would not be unreasonably refused as long as the applicant complies with a set of previously established rules. (Those rules could, of course, have included a design code and provisions for the additional infrastructure needs – this was never about a “free-for-all”). A rules-based system is preferable to a discretionary case-by-case system, because the latter effectively gives time-rich troublemakers a veto. Most people broadly accept the need for more house building. But nobody is fanatically in favour of it. The fanaticism is all on one side: the anti-housing side. Which is why that side always wins. And thanks to the government’s cowardice – they will keep winning.More from NewsUS warns Russia against using gas supplies as \u0026#39tool of coercion\u0026#39 against EuropeDaily meat consumption falls by 17pc in a decade in effort to reduce methane emissionsTravel red list slashed to just seven countriesGet your flu vaccine early even if you\u0026#39re not vulnerable, urges Government scientistHow to show proof of Covid vaccination for travel abroadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"whisper children like living parents","story":"The Spanish government wants to pay young adults to stop living with their parents. The average Spaniard doesn’t leave the family home until the age of 30. So Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is proposing a new £250 monthly voucher for 18-35-year-olds, to encourage them to rent their own homes.Although British children leave home earlier than most Europeans (24, on average) we, too, are slowing down. Around 3.5 million young adults in the UK now live with their parents, an increase of a third in a decade. This is generally thought to be a bad thing, caused by exorbitant housing costs.But what if there’s more to it than just economics? What if children are staying at home because – whisper it – they actually like living with their parents?It’s not impossible, the way it once was. Previous generations of parent were almost ideologically opposed to getting chummy with their children. The sons of the ruling classes were systematically removed from the home at seven, lest they should grow too attached to their mothers. Separation was thought to be character-building. Even in the most loving families, the ide between young and old was clearly demarcated by authority – the absolute rule of the parents.Since the Sixties, each generation of parents has further loosened its collar. Rules of intergenerational decorum that once seemed cast iron have been bent, and then broken, and then tossed aside. My own parents, though exceedingly relaxed and bonhomous for their time, drew the line at letting boys stay over. When I was 21, a boyfriend hitchhiked all the way from Newcastle to London to see me. “How wonderful!” said my dad, ushering him in. “We’d better put a tent up in the garden.”My cohort of parents has largely jettisoned that rule. Indeed, the traditional cry of “My house, my rules” seems to be fading out altogether. Children are increasingly treated as equals – albeit truculent and ignorant equals – whose voices should be heard.The results of this experiment are mixed: no one could claim that the nation’s children appear much happier or more well-behaved for it. But they do seem to enjoy the company of their parents – and vice versa. Several surveys have found that, despite the stresses of lockdown, most families have relished spending more time together since the pandemic began.Far from being a sign of failure, living with your parents denotes a kind of success. After centuries of struggle, families may finally be learning to get along.Uniquely among the human race, I have never watched The Sopranos. I’m sure it’s as good as everyone says, but I find our cultural fascination with the mafia irksome. I can’t buy into the idea of violent thugs being brilliant strategists, or full of hidden depths.Sure enough, the reality is gratifyingly stupid. Court papers filed in New York reveal that members of the Colombo crime family have been conducting extortion rackets by text message, leaving a juicy digital trail for detectives. According to one former mobster, it’s a generational problem: “Everything is on the phones with them!” But one of the texts – “Hey, this is the 2nd text, there isn’t going to be a 3rd” – was sent by a 56-year-old knuckle-dragger. The idiocy goes back generations only the technology is new.More from NewsUS warns Russia against using gas supplies as \u0026#39tool of coercion\u0026#39 against EuropeDaily meat consumption falls by 17pc in a decade in effort to reduce methane emissionsTravel red list slashed to just seven countriesGet your flu vaccine early even if you\u0026#39re not vulnerable, urges Government scientistHow to show proof of Covid vaccination for travel abroadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gap private school fees state school spending doubles decade","story":"The gap between private school fees and state school spending has more than doubled in a decade, a new analysis has found.The average fees for independent schools were £13,600 in the last academic year, according to research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).That is 90 per cent higher than the amount the Government spends on the education of each pupil in state schools, which is £6,500 per year.A decade ago, the gap was 39 per cent, with average private school fees at £11,100 compared to the state spend of £8,000 on each pupil.Researchers found that private school fees have grown by more than 20 per cent after inflation since 2009-10.Meanwhile, core or day-to-day state school spending per pupil in England has fallen by nine per cent in real terms, over the same period, or by 14 per cent including the effects of cuts to capital spending.Headteachers criticised ministers saying it is “pretty outrageous” that the Government has cut funding in real terms to schools over the last ten years while private fees have increased.It comes amid concerns that the pandemic has cemented the lead that private school pupils have on their state-educated counterparts since they were far better equipped to deliver remote education during lockdowns.Private schools in England also saw the largest increase in top GCSE and A-level grades this summer compared with state schools.Luke Sibieta, IFS research fellow and author of the study, said: “Longstanding concerns about inequalities between private and state school pupils, which have come into sharp focus during the pandemic, will not begin to be easily addressed while the sectors enjoy such different levels of resourcing.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The funding gap between the two sectors has always been there of course, but the fact it has widened to such a huge extent does stick in the throat.“It means that while state schools and colleges have been forced to cut back on things like subject choices, pastoral support and extracurricular activities – and with secondary class sizes rising – independent schools have been able to improve their provision in all these areas.“Surely the Government should want the same opportunities for all children and young people. It may be naïve to think that state education funding could match the independent sector but it surely shouldn’t actually go into reverse.”The IFS analysis said there is “wide distribution in spending levels” in the state and private sectors.Funding for the most deprived state secondary schools is only half the value of average fee levels in private schools, and private school fees are 2.4 times more than funding levels at the least deprived state secondary schools.A Department for Education spokesman said:“This Government is providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade – £14 billion in total over the three years to 2022-23. This includes a £7.1 billion increase in funding for schools by 2022-23, compared to 2019-20 funding levels.More from NewsUS warns Russia against using gas supplies as \u0026#39tool of coercion\u0026#39 against EuropeDaily meat consumption falls by 17pc in a decade in effort to reduce methane emissionsTravel red list slashed to just seven countriesGet your flu vaccine early even if you\u0026#39re not vulnerable, urges Government scientistHow to show proof of Covid vaccination for travel abroadMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"determined reddit users try maths","story":":root Determined Reddit users try maths to solve tricky Squid Game puzzleSquid Game is ruling the roost for Netflix viewership, but can maths solve the tricky puzzle in episode seven Episode seven left many Reddit users scratching their heads for a mathematical solutionByEmily Sleight:,  Oct | comments South Korean drama Squid Game has become an addiction for some as the nine-episode thriller is set to become Netflix ’s biggest non-English-language show yet. Haven’t seen it yet  In a nutshell, Squid Game is a fictional survival series which requires people to participate in what looks like childrenaposs games.Either they win or die trying, and this story focuses on a man willing to do anything to support his daughter and save his dying mother. There are plenty of mind boggling puzzles throughout the series, and one in episode seven had some Reddit users stumped.Just a quick warning, the below will contain spoilers, so look awayyou haven’t finished the series yet. So, what’s the puzzle in episode seven The puzzle involves a giant bridge full of alternating stepping stones.The stepping stones are made of either tempered or normal glass, the tempered glass will hold the weight of two people, the normal class won’t even support one.Each vest number determines the order in which to cross the bridge, and the worst part is, there’s a time limit of  minutes.One Reddit usertheydidthemathtook to the popular internet forum to suss out the best mathematical way to beat the game.They said: “At each step the panes are randomized, and the players have no way of knowing which is which until they jump on one. Each step is essentially a   guess, and all  steps must be crossed in order.“Itaposs not all luck though. The  players must cross the bridge one at a time, and they get to choose what order they play in.Maths-Whizz is a super clever virtual maths tutor which delivers interactive games, lessons and exercises for five to  year olds.To see how good it is at transforming home learning for parents, weaposve negotiated an exclusive % off price to make it £. for the first month.Seeyou like it first and sign up to a -day no-obligation free trial by you can do that here. If you want to sign up for a month at a time or even a year, you can do that here but donapost forget to use the promo code aposMATHSapos.  “Each player gets to observe the progress of all those who went before them, meaning they can memorize which panes have been stepped on and which ones broke.” Given the knowledge of the puzzle, the Reddit user wondered what was the best position to choose to have the best chances of safely crossing the bridge  It might not be that simple though, as one user responded by saying: “If you wait in position  then youaposre starting to have a realistic chance of making it - six per cent. “But the odds are never really in your favour eventime is no issue and you go at position  you only have a % chance of making it across. Itaposs like they WANT you to die.”The top comment wins though, and is definitely the most complicated:“Nice problem! This may be computed recursively as:q[m_, t_] : q[m, t]  If[m lt ,  ^t, Sum[q[m - , x] ^, ]] “Then the probability p that the m-th player is the first to safely cross a bridge with s steps is: p[m_, s_] : If[m lt ,  ^s, Sum[q[m - , t] ^, ]]” “The following table shows the resulting exact probabilities: Player P                                                                                Fail    ”Did that frazzle your brain too  To simply, the user said “it’s best to be tenth in line out of  players.”We’re wondering why they didn’t just say that in the first place.

Bradford, Derby and Southampton are among cities in England bidding to follow in the footsteps of Coventry and Hull. Wrexham County Borough is bidding in Wales, Stirling in Scotland and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in Northern Ireland. England also has two larger county regions bidding for the city of culture crown - Cornwall and County Durham. The counties could apply because there are no set eligibility criteria for the size of a place that can submit a bid. A City of Culture is only named every four years and the winner will run a year-long programme of events. Ministers say the eight areas will each be given £, to work up a bid, with a shortlist picked early next year.  For the first time they will be expected to use culture to level up their area, to help achieve Boris Johnsonaposs election pledge. A further  areas submitted bids but did not make the cut, including Medway, Lancashire, Powys and Wolverhampton. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said: “Winning the UK City of Culture competition has a hugely positive impact on an area, driving investment, creating jobs, and highlighting that culture is for everyone, regardless of their background. “This year’s focus is on levelling up access to culture across the country and making sure there is a legacy that continues for generations to come. I look forward to seeing what this brilliant longlist has in store as they continue in the competition.” Sir Phil Redmond, Chair of the City of Culture Expert Advisory Panel, said: “The Expressions of Interest stage was introduced as an opportunity to encourage many more places to experience the benefit of coming together to define and share a cultural vision for their areas. What the longlist demonstrates is the range and depth of cultural ambition across the whole of the UK. “Each is dferent. Each has its own story to tell. All share a common aim: to demonstrate how culture can act as the creative catalyst for change.

The cost of a family getaway will drop by about £ once PCR tests, which cost about £ each, are ditched in favour of the cheaper tests which cost as little as £. Travellers will be required to send a photo of their negative result two days after arriving in Britain. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the change would be in place hopefully in time for people ing from half term holidays potentially - and certainly by the end of October. An announcement will be made in the coming days, he said. Mr Shapps told the Today programme: I donapost have a date for you as yet.I know my colleagues over at the Department for Health and Border Force are working very hard on implementing that and hopefully in time for people ing from half term holidays potentially - and certainly by the end of October. He said the delay was so the industry would have time to adjust to the new system and told Sky News that the change would be announced in the coming days. People arriving in the UK who take a lateral flow test to check their Covid status will have to take a photograph of it to prove the result. If itaposs positive, they will receive a PCR automatically. Weaposre going to ask people to take a photograph of it so that itaposs actually your test and thataposs it, the job is done, thereaposs nothing further to do, he said. So itaposs going to be a much simplied, much cheaper system. Asked how authorities could be sure the photographed test belonged to the right person, Mr Shapps said: Well, look, you could always say this with any system, the PCR system thataposs been in place up until now hasnapost required any monitoring at all. So you could always make that argument. We have throughout this crisis, though, I think relied on peopleaposs common sense, I think most people wanted to do the right thing. It came as it was announced that  countries including South Africa, Mexico and Thailand will be removed from England’s red list on Monday.Travellers arriving from those destinations will no longer need to spend  nights in a quarantine hotel at a cost of £, for solo travellers. Just seven countries will remain on the red list following the changes. They are Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, Peru and Venezuela. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own travel rules but have recently mirrored announcements made in Westminster. Mr Shapps said: “With half-term and winter sun around the corner, we’re making it easier for families and loved ones to reunite by signicantly cutting the number of destinations on the red list, thanks in part to the increased vaccination efforts around the globe. “Restoring people’s confidence in travel is key to rebuilding our economy and levelling up this country. With less restrictions and more people travelling, we can all continue to move safely forward together along our pathway to recovery.” Mr Shapps also announced that the Government would recognise vaccines for arrivals from a further  countries and territories including Brazil, Ghana, Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Turkey. The decision means fully vaccinated people entering England from these locations will be exempt from quarantine, the pre-departure test and the day-eight post-arrival test.  Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: “Our robust border measures have helped protect the phenomenal progress of our vaccination programme, and it is because of this success both here and around the world that we can safely open up travel further and we can visit friends and family abroad.“We’re now making it easier and cheaper for people to travel by allowing fully vaccinated travellers from non-red list countries to use lateral flow tests on day two of arrival, as long as they provide proof of use.” No date has been set on when eligible fully-vaccinated arrivals will be able to use a lateral flow test for their day-two test, rather than the more expensive PCR version. The Government said its “ambition” is for this to be in place “for people ing from half-term breaks by the end of the month”.  Travellers will be able to very they have completed a lateral flow test by sending a photograph. British Airways announced it will resume services and increase frequencies to a number of winter sun destinations being removed from the red list, such as Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa Mexico City and Cancun, Mexico Sao Paulo, Brazil and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The airline’s chief executive Sean Doyle said: “It finally feels like we are seeing light at the end of a very long tunnel. “Britain will benefit from this signicant reduction in red list countries and now it’s time to turn our attention to eradicating testing for fully-vaccinated travellers to ensure we don’t lose our place on the global stage.” Charlie Cornish, boss of Manchester Airports Group – which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports – said: “Removing so many countries from the red list gives people the most choice they have had since before the pandemic, which will help stimulate the recovery of the UK’s prized aviation sector.” Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said: “It’s been a long time coming but at last we’re seeing the layers of complexity peeled away.”Recent analysis by the PA news agency found there have been more than  changes to the rules for international travel during the coronavirus pandemic.Comment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley admitted it was a worrying time for consumers, who also face a hike in national insurance contributions next year. The existing £, energy price cap will be reviewed in April, which protects households from sudden hikes in their bills. Analysts have suggested annual bills could soar past £, for the first time, with increases of up to £ next year. Mr Brearley told the Today programme: Unfortunately we have seen an extraordinary rise in the gas price.  Itaposs hard to tell how much but we do expect bills to rise in future. Askedthe price cap would rise, he said: Yes that is the expectation. We canapost predict everything, as we have seen the wholesale market has gone up and down extremely quickly. We canapost predict fully what that will be but looking at the costs that are in the system, we are expecting a signicant rise in April. Mr Brearley said the current cap would remain in place until April, with no plans to raise it before then. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will hold talks on Friday with the representatives of energy intensive industries, such as steel and chemicals, to discuss the wholesale gas crisis. It comes after a top White House official has accused Russia of using gas supplies as a “weapon” as the UK grapples with an energy price spike. US President Joe Bidenaposs national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned the Kremlin not to exploit spiralling costs as “coercion”. The United States has a real concern that, for a iety of reasons, supply is not keeping up with recovering demand,” he said. Russia is a major natural gas supplier to Europe, and its energy giant Gazprom is now at the centre of a dispute over whether it could do more to ease prices in the spot market. AskedRussia was holding back energy as leverage, Mr Sullivan said: Russia has a history of using energy as a tool of coercion, as a political weapon. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he didnapost know to what extent there could be Russian intervention.He told Times Radio: Thereaposs a massive global uplt in prices and, as the world has woken up from, you know, being in a slumber of coronavirus, as with a lot of commodities the price has gone up.I donapost know the extent to which thereaposs sort of Russian intervention. What I do know is, fortunately, % of our production is domestic. The vast majority of the rest is from Norway. I think Iaposm right in saying that, of the gas, only about % is from Russia, so weaposre not directly impacted other than, of course, the global gas price does have an impact overall.

Ministers avoided all talk of Covid, until braggadocio Boris Johnson played it for laughs in an orgy of self-congratulation. He joked about Michael Gove dancing in a nightclub, and applauded himself for their “cheek by jowler” gathering.Unlike Labour’s bash last week, the Tories didn’t wear face masks, or observe social distancing. No virus testing.I’m just back from Greece, where the infection rate is around  per ,. Here in Sutton and Cross Hills, the most recent figure was , making me three times more likely to catch it at home. But face coverings are mandatory on Greek public transport, in shops and public buildings. Hotel guests must wear plastic gloves to collect food for breakfast. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  You must show a Covid passport to enter even an open-air museum, and many people – particularly oldies – wear masks in the street. What a dference! Blasé BoJo bellowed on the radio: “There is nothing I can see in the data, nothing I can see in rates of infection at the moment that makes me think we need to drop Plan A. It justies the decision to open up.”  This latter-day Admiral Nelson can’t see that new infections regularly exceed , a day, putting the UK at or near the top of the world league – that Covid features in one in  deaths registered, amounting to  in one September week. We now lag behind Portugal, Spain, France and Italy in the vaccination league. Johnson boasts he has the guts to change Britain. He hasn’t even got the guts to face up to the continuing Covid crisis. Grave situation Killjoys in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, protested about a beer festival in their local church, St Mary the Virgin, that spilled over into the graveyard. Organiser, Rev Martin Anderson, raising funds for the church clock, apologised profusely for pints on the tombs.  I fail to see why. Churchyard revelry was normal for centuries from the Middle Ages, with special “church ale” brewed by the wardens. If I qualy for burial in Cowling churchyard, I shan’t mind people quaffing real ale round it. Just no dancing on the grave, please. Toxic type of scroll model Oh, how I chuckled when social media addicts bewailed the six-hour shutdown of Facebook. They came on the airwaves to express grief at being cut off from their communications drug. There is one sure way of getting this monkey off their back. Just say No. Facebook has been with us for only  years, its subsidiary profit-making s Instagram and WhatsApp for even fewer.  Before that, we got by with email, the phone, the letter and that most rewarding form of communication of all, conversation. Between real people, face to face. Why should we now put ourselves in thrall to the multi-billionaire Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg  And put young people at risk of addiction to this toxic drug  I have nothing to do with social media – any of it – and I don’t feel my le is inadequate.

During the wide-ranging interview, the -year-old father-of-one also opened up about his turbulent childhood, which almost included him and his siblings being taken into care after mum Mary was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The MP said he has faced mental health struggle which only became clear to him when a local councillor urged him to seek support. He said: It was an important moment, actually, because I thought, this is visible to other people. Iaposm clearly not happy. My Coyle said he appeared to be completely ing and was out and about in parliament, but the atmosphere in Westminster was febrile as the aftermath of the Brexit vote played out.  Things came to a head when his home, which he shares with his we and young daughter Esme, was targeted. He said: I had somebody break the window, my home, my bedroom window home during the Brexit debate. He added: There’s no way out the back, it’s a brick wall. So, I was sat with a cricket bat in case they came through. The MP said he needed help from therapists in the weeks and months ahead as the massive stress took a toll. He said: Iaposve had bouts of depression and things, but I have CBT . I think that when Jo was murdered, it triggered lots... that was a very dficult time. Mr Coyle, who grew up in Luton alongside two brothers and a sister, said his childhood was very dficult but, in the end, helped him to build emotional resilience.  He said his motheraposs mental health deteriorated when his father left. He said: Sadly, some of my earliest memories are the most dficult. There was a time where mum set fire to the living room carpet because she was trying to keep us warm. There was no intent to damage or harm anybody or the property. We used to have the coin meter. People donapost see them anymore, so they find it hard to understand - but I donapost know whether she didnapost have any money to work the heating system. I donapost know whether her mental health had collapsed so badly that she just didnapost know how to do it - but she set fire to the carpet. Mary was previously a primary school teacher and ran a drop-in club for kids, but her mental state crumbled very badly and she was eventually sectioned. Mr Coyle revealed how this occurred again recently, but she only got help after she crashed her car into a bollard. While no-one was hurt, a psychiatric assessment was ordered, he said. Mr Coyle said: It was only because she was in the criminal justice system that the magistrate was able to order a psychiatric assessment, and thataposs what got her back into mental healthcare, which is crazy. The system is crazy, not people. The MP added that he was grateful that as a youngster he wasnapost taken into local authority care He said: My nan was integral to keeping us togetheroutcomes for children in care in those days were dramatically worse than they are now, and theyaposre still very poor for many children.Comment MORE ON Labour PartyAsdaMental healthSocial servicesCrimeDangerous drivingCar crashesPoliticsBenefitsTax Credits\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Speaking to Sky News, Mr Zahawi said he was concerned about the impact Covid- measures had on attendance. He said: The good news is that - and thanks to the brilliant teachers and support staff and parents and children - % of schools are open. Attendance has gone up, the last set of figures I looked at was about %, which obviously will fluctuate depending on infection rates. But my priority is to protect education, keep those schools open. But he said he was not looking toto the bubble system to do so, because actually, you saw the fall off in attendance which really does harm mental wellbeing, mental health of children. That is despite Englnad’s schools previously being told backup plans must “cover the possibility that in some local areas it may become necessary to reintroduce ‘bubbles’ for a temporary period, to reduce mixing between groups. “Any decision to recommend the reintroduction of ‘bubbles’ would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education.” Comment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That is despite think tanks putting the worst-case estimate at around , to , people. The Joseph Rowntree Foundationhas said the cut risks moving , people including , children below the poverty line. While the Legatum Institute think tank, led by Tory UC architect Baroness Stroud, says the change will hit , Brits who are currently just above the poverty line - including , children. But ministers have no official figure for how many people will be thrown into poverty because they’ve refused to do a formal impact assessment. And questioned by left-wing journalist Owen Jones at the Tory conference, Ms Dorries said: “Nobody. Nobody is.  “No no no, because, no Owen of course not. “Because what we’re doing, what we’re doing is giving people a step out. “By letime skills guarantee, by all the money being invested in the…” - she then walked away with an aide. Analysis by the JRF has found more than , working-age families in Ms Dorries’ Mid Bedfordshire constituency will be affected by the cut to UC and Tax Credits. That includes % of all working-age families with childrenand % of all working-age families without children . Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “These comments show just how far away the Conservative Party is from the real world. “Charities and foodbanks have been warning for months that taking £, away from millions of families in the midst of a Conservative cost of living crisis will push children into poverty.” The cut officially began yesterday and will kick into payments from next Wednesday. Read more Boris Johnson did not mention it once in his -minute conference speech which was peppered with jokes.Katie Schmuecker of the JRF said yesterday: “The Prime Minister has not had the guts to look the millions of people whose incomes are being cut today in the eye and tell them how they are expected to get through the year ahead. “The Prime Minister’s attempt to strike an upbeat tone is completely at odds with the despair people are feeling and the cost-of-living crisis we are now facing.” Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey was asked the same question as Ms Dorries by Owen Jones. She replied: “Well it was always a temporary uplt, and that’s why no impact assessment was done when we knew it was temporary. “We are investing in the plan for jobs, we’ve also got the household support fund… we want to try and see what’s going on, what it is we can to help people with the skills so they can absolutely take advantage of higher-paid jobs.” Comment MORE ON Nadine DorriesOwen JonesJonathan ReynoldsBoris JohnsonConservative PartyPensionspovertyPoliticsBenefitsTax Credits\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

While he was on the call, I pushed three times and the baby was out, she said. When the ambulance arrived, baby Alec had already been born. He and Tilda were taken to hospital to be checked over as Tilda hadnapost had any scans or tests throughout the pregnancy.  “I was confused, scared, anxious. I was alone already, a single mother for my daughter and now another one was coming into our lives, she said. “Luckily, the baby was perfectly fine and healthy.” While in hospital, Tilda started to organise what she could and her family helped prepare for them coming home.

Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was found unresponsive at a home in Shirley, Solihull on June  last year. He died at Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital the following day - with a post-mortem examination confirming his death was caused by a head injury.Arthuraposs father Thomas Hughes,  and Emma Tustin, aged , were subsequently arrested and charged, reports Birmingham Live.Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC told Coventry Crown Court: Arthur was denied the opportunity to eat meals with other members of the family. If he didnapost comply with instructions he was denied access to water.  You heard messages of Arthur calling for his uncle or nanny. Arthur wasnapost permitted to maintain relationships with his uncles and grandparents. He was isolated from them. Evidence indicates Arthur was physically and verbally abused, isolated, access to food and drink controlled or restricted. He was deprived of basic living comforts. Emma Tustin recorded more than  audio files of Arthur in ious stages of distress. Mr Hankin also told the court Arthur was made to stand on the step by the front door for up to  hours a day. He continued: It is inconceivable a reasonable carer would be unaware the prolonged isolation, forcible standing, control of access to food and drink were the cause of Arthuraposs distressed state. In my opinion these clips show Arthur articulating his needs extremely clearly. He is desperately calling for help. It appears to be very clear, in calling for his uncle and his grandparents he is expressing he wants adults to come who will care for him and will put an end to his suffering. In conjunction with the CCTV footage, in my judgement over a period spanning many weeks Ms Tustin and Mr Hughes terrorised Arthur, degraded, neglected and physically and emotionally abused him.Mr Hankin also told the court it is suspected the six-year-old was repeatedly poisoned with salt contaminated food or fluids possibly by thirsting him.He told the court that between .am and .pm on June  Arthur consumed around grams of salt, equal to six and a half tablespoons.One medical expert concluded Arthur could have been aposrepeatedly administered moderate doses of saltapos.The court heard how Arthur was fatally injured in Tustinaposs sole care while Hughes was out shopping, jurors hear Mr Hankin says Tustin, Hughes and Arthur ed to Cranmore Road at pm but at around .pm Hughes left to go to the supermarket. He continued: It was during that absence Arthur was assaulted, suffering unsurvivable brain injuries. Evidence shows the event that caused Arthuraposs collapse occurred while he was in Emma Tustinaposs sole care.  Mr Hankin says Tustin messaged Hughes at .pm to complain that Arthur was aposstill screamingapos. He told the court at .pm Hughes texted Tustin explaining he had spotted his mother in Sainsburyaposs and asked Tustin to aposmove him to the back doorapos in case his mother visited. The prosecutor said Tustin was upstairs between .pm and .pm and sent a picture message to Hughes showing Arthuraposs face. Mr Hankin added: There was a blue mark on his forehead consistent with a bruise. There appears to be blood on the right nostril. His lips were red. His right eye was closed. From his expression he appears to be in pain. The jury heard Tustin claimed to Hughes that Arthur had aposthrew himself against the wall in the bedroomapos. Mr Hankin says the first ambulance arrived at .pm with the crew witnessing Arthur on his back on the floor receiving CPR from the neighbour. He states he aposrapidly progressed to cardiac arrestapos but advanced le support measures were able to restore his heartbeat.Mr Hankin told the court Arthuraposs gums were bleeding and his teeth were in poor condition. He says he was transferred to Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital where he arrived at .pm.The prosecutor told the court around pm Tustin, who had remained at home, appeared to knock over the camera inside the property seconds before a police officer entered the room. Returning to Arthur, Mr Hankin says he aposremained very unstableapos and suffered two further cardiac arrests. He was transferred to intensive care and had a CT scan which showed aposindicators of physical abuseapos. They have both pleaded not guilty to murder. Tustin has admitted one count of assaulting a child but has denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denies child assault offences.

Patients who attend the vaccine centre are also being offered the option of a flu vaccine Image: Getty ImagesByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  Oct | comments As Professor Jonathan Van-Tam issues a rallying cry to the nation over fears of a killer flu season, we answer six key questions.Modelling suggests as many as , people could die from flu this winter as natural immunity has been weakened due to successive lockdowns. Modelling from the Academy of Medical Sciences predicts between , and , flu deaths and million Brits are set to be offered a free jab. But who can get it, and the Covid- booster as well  Can you catch both viruses together, and would that make the prospect of death more likely  For answers to those questions and more, read on... Who can get the flu jab  The flu jab has now been expanded to include all school-age children on top of those aged two to three.  All over s can get a free jab as well as health and care workers, unpaid carers, people living in long-stay residential care, pregnant women and anyone who lives with someone with a condition that makes them susceptible to infection. Under s who don’t qualy for a free flu jab can buy one privately from a pharmacist for around £. Who can get a Covid- booster  They are being offered to over-s and people with certain underlying health conditions.  Frontline healthcare workers, social care workers and unpaid carers will also be eligible. These groups will be offered a third dose at least six months after their second, as soon as local NHS stocks allow. Will I get one in each arm  The NHS is advised to administer both doses at the same appointmentstocks allow. Clinical trials have shown this is safe and both vaccines are just as effective when injected at the same time.  Howeveronly one is available the NHS will offer that straight away rather than delaying vaccine protection. Most people will be offered the jabs in separate appointments. Can you get flu and Covid- at the same time  It is rare but still possible to catch two respiratory viruses at once. Covid- is still relatively new so it is unclear how likely it is to develop alongside a flu infection. Are you more likely to diethat happens  This winter will be the first time both flu and the SARS-CoV- virus, that causes Covid- disease, will be circulating widely. The possibility of being hit by two at once - or one when you have not yet fully recovered from the other - is a concern. Experts fear it could make hospitalisation and death more likely.  How do you get your jabs  People can book their free NHS flu vaccine via pharmacies or they can wait for their GP surgery to contact them.Those eligible for a coronavirus booster jab are being told to wait until they are contacted, although health and social care workers can book one online via the NHS website.Comment MORE ON NHSFluCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kate Marlow, from Bridgend, Wales, said her home has flooded four times in less than two years, causing more than £, worth of damage. The -year-old said the problems started when Storm Dennis struck in February last year, WalesOnline reports. Water poured into the home, which she shares with her mum, brother and five dogs, ruining everything apart from the top floor.She said: We moved into our house in August  and all was fine until Storm Dennis arrived in early . All this water came running down the mountain road opposite and went right through the garage and into our home - the bottom two floors of which are technically below ground level because the house is built on a gradient.  She added that everything other than the top floor was ruined - furniture destroyed, ceilings put through - and the family were forced to move into temporary accommodation while the clean-up and repair work took place.Unfortunately, because of our dogs, the closest pet-friendly place we could find was in Barry - nearly  miles away - and the arrival of Covid restrictions meant we ended up stuck there for  months, she added. However, an initial council review deemed the incident a one-off, attributable to the freak conditions brought about by the storm.  But,  days later, the same thing happened again - and then for a third time in January . On that occasion Iaposd driven back from Barry to let the painters and decorators in, only to find inside was soaking wet, said Kate.And now itaposs happened for a fourth time following that awful weather we had earlier this week.That said, none of our neighbours ever seem to be affected - they canapost work out why it keeps happening and neither can we.  Bank worker Kate said her home is the only property on the road that is repeatedly hit by flood water whenever thereaposs heavy rainfall. Thereaposs just farm land above us, along with an old quarry from which any excess water would drain away in dferent directions, she said. Maybe somethingaposs changed to alter the route of that run-off, I just donapost know. Weaposve had a look around and none of the nearby culverts seem to be blocked or anything.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter What I am sure of though is that itaposs like living at the bottom of a water slide and whenever it starts raining heavily any hope of being able to sleep at night goes out the window. Itaposs so stressful. Weaposve reached out to the council for help but, after being told theyaposd look into it, weaposve heard nothing. Our last contact with them was back in February. And while our insurance company has been very good so far, thereaposs a limit to how often theyaposll be willing to pay out. I just canapost bear the idea of losing everything yet again. A spokesperson from Bridgend County Borough Council said, We have maintained contact with the residents at this address and visited the property as recently as this week. A great deal of work has been carried out to try and determine the source of the flooding. While it appears to occur during exceptionally heavy rainfall, the cause is not linked to the council-maintained drainage network.  He added that following investigations and discussions with local private landowners a scheme has been developed which would enable inlet headwalls - small retaining structures placed at the entrance of storm water pipes or culverts - to be improved on a nearby private road. During severe weather, this would seek to mitigate excess water from running down the road and affecting the property in the event that the sheer volume proves to be too much for the inlets to cope with, the spokesman said.However, this work requires both landowner approval and funding from Welsh Government before it can be implemented. While it is progressing, we are looking at other options for capturing surface water run-off in the area, and have contacted local landowners to discuss issues such as clearing debris from existing inlet grids, their rights and responsibilities around water courses and more.

The siblings aged ,  and  are currently sharing one double room in the Southwark home. Georgie Hodges, , has lived at the property since  with her parents, Pascale and Jimmy Hodges and her three siblings. “When we first moved here we had come from a property which had extensive disrepair and was completely inhabitable, she said. “It was so bad that my brother was hospitalised due to the conditions of the last place.”She said her mother, Pascale, had been on the housing list for  years prior to that, reports MyLondon. “My siblings and I were younger when we first moved into this property so overcrowding wasn’t an issue but now we are teenagers and young adults we can’t continue to live like this, she added.  According to Georgie, the council says that they are not deemed to be overcrowded as they consider their living room as a bedroom despite it being an open-plan kitchen. She told MyLondon: “We absolutely can’t use our living room as a bedroom, it’s essentially a kitchen. Sleeping or not sleeping, it’s not suitable. “How do they expect someone to sleep in the same room someone is cooking  “We’re literally living on top of each other, we don’t have any privacy and some of us are young adults now. “During lockdown, we were all sheltering which brought tensions and anxieties to an all-time high.” A home is considered to be overcrowded, or statutory overcrowdedtwo people of the same sex have to sleep in the same room, over the age of . The family has a number of medical needs including chromosome deletion which is exacerbated by the overcrowding. “One of my siblings has quite severe mental health and the council is aware of this and they ignore the direct impact that our living situation is having on that, she claims. Our chromosome deletion means we’re quite prone to severe levels of mental health, we’re prone to things like schizophreniawe get high levels of stress and nobody is acknowledging the impact the overcrowding is having on us. Despite numerous attempts to explain this to the council, they are told that they do not meet the threshold. The family is currently disputing the council’s decision to place them on band  of the housing list, where they are deemed low risk.  They are trying to be moved into band  on medical grounds but say this is proving dficult. Georgie said: “We’ve literally got a huge ring bind folder of evidence that we’ve collected and submitted but every time we talk to the council we get someone new who doesn’t understand our case and we have to go through the whole thing again which can be quite traumatic.” Councillor Stephanie Cryan, cabinet member for council homes and homelessness said: “Council housing is in very high demand and very short supply in central London, despite our council home-building programme and exemplary service in preventing homelessness. Not every family we see will be able to move to a larger home when they wish. We always carry out a fair and detailed assessment of families’ needs. In this case, the family has a three bedroomed property with an extra room which could be used as a bedroom, making it large enough for over seven people. As such, we do not believe the family is overcrowded but we will continue to support them in resolving their housing situation, and the adult children can apply for an inidual housing assessment.” The family say their living situation is further strained by anti-social behaviour such as people kicking their door down, lying in front of the front door so they have to step over them and even screaming at all hours. Georgie added: “In the last year, it’s escalated really badly. We had a fire which was suspected arson but was never investigated further which of course drives everyoneaposs anxiety up even more.” The family say that Peabody, their housing association, are aware of the issues but have failed to provide any solution yet. “Nothing is ever followed up and nothing changes, Georgie said. They actually closed a case and marked it as resolved without actually resolving it.” A Peabody spokesperson said: “We have been managing the situation at Jacobs Island House and are aware of the current issues that they have been having at the residence. “There is a signicant demand for homes, and it is dficult to move residents into bigger properties. We have recommended the Next Steps Accommodation Programme to them, which supports iniduals to move into long-term accommodation. We understand that they have registered for this programme. We are continuing to investigate this and will keep the family informed of progress. “We take any antisocial behaviour complaints from our residents seriously. We are aware of the issues the family have been having with their neighbours. We have been actively managing this situation and will be reaching out to the family for further information.” Comment MORE ON Homelessnessproperty news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However it has been swamped with TripAdvisor complaints from guests bemoaning uncontrollable refugee children, while a flurry of one-star reviews have seen it currently ranked as the worst hotel in the seaside town.It comes after the venue found itself at the centre of a bomb hoax this week in which guests were evacuated while police stormed the area, Teesside Live.Anti-refugee leaflets were also posted around the town, dubbed reprehensible by local councillor David Chance, who claimed they were methods designed to undermine efforts to help the families. Two women who planned on visiting the hotel later this month said they have now been told they will not be able to claim a refund from National Holidays for the £ they paid each.  One of the women, who both asked not to be named, said: Our concern is about safety and leaving things in our room, because of what we read about theft and kids running wild. By no means are we racist - Iaposve worked with refugees, and it is not their fault. It is just the predicament that they are in. I totally agree they should have got out the country, but my concern is the company didnapost inform us what the Grand Hotel was doing. They claim when they contacted the firm, they were effectively told they wouldnapost get a penny of their £ back, with the booking having no cancellation policy. They further claimed they were told they could present evidence that the hotel was being used to house refugees, but that any complaint may not be dealt with until after their break.  They are basically saying thatwe get to the hotel and donapost feel safe, then that is our problem - but it it is their problem, as they should have notied us, said the woman, who claims she only found out about the other guests on social media. As a customer they should be informing all of the paying guests what is going on there. The hotel found itself at the centre of a bomb hoax this week in which guests were evacuated while police stormed the area. Mondayaposs hoax, as well as anti-refugee leaflets being posted around the town, were later reportedly dubbed reprehensible by local councillor David Chance, who claimed they were methods designed to undermine efforts to help the families.And defending the hotelaposs temporary tenants, he told Examiner Live: If you go on holiday you will always have a bit of boisterousness. Thereaposs no doubt about that. Our kids abroad can be just as bad. I have experienced it myself.My point of view is that we should be helping them as much as we can and I find it reprehensible that people are trying to undermine them. The same people trying to have a problem will no doubt not have done much for our armed forces. Around  refugees are reportedly staying at Scarborough hotels, including the -year-old Victorian venue, which is owned by Britannia Hotels.They are among the thousands flown to Britain earlier this year following the Talibanaposs resurgence, in what was one of the biggest ever evacuation operations. A National Holidays spokesperson said: “We appreciatesharing their concerns with us, and do understand that news cycles during challenging times can cause heightened concern and confusion. However, rest assured that we are in constant contact with the hotel, which is operating as normal, and has been welcoming National Holidays guests for many years.” Comment MORE ON TripadvisorNorth Yorkshire PoliceTalibanBritannia Hotels Ltd.Grand Hotel AS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Then she rang her boss and we could hear her having a go at her boss, saying aposIaposm over my time now, Iaposm going to have to let everybody off the busyou donapost send another driver down here, because Iaposve done five hours overtimeapos. She was basically shouting down the bus that her boss, who was on the phone at the time to her, and she said aposmy boss has just said to me that we have to vacate the bus because theyaposre not sending another driver outapos.  I said to the female driver, aposThataposs not on really, I have a daughter in a wheelchair, I cannot physically push her in a wheelchair, all the way homeapos but basically, she was not bothered. She said, aposWell, Iaposm sorry about that, but Iaposm over my hours and you have to vacate the bus, because my boss is not going to send another driver out to replace me.apos My daughter was very anxious. She was cold and tired. And there was also no heating on the bus, either. Speaking to the BBC on Tuesday, Ben Gilligan of East Yorkshire buses said of their current driver shortage: We have a lot of interviews going on at the moment and driving assessments.  But we do expect, certainly between now and Christmas, we donapost think weaposll be able to run a full service, but we will be expecting that we can run our temporary reduced timetables. The bus driver shortages have become a hot political issue in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Liberal Democrat councillor Dennis Healy has urged the council to take action on the current bus service issues. The council needs to take a clear lead in tackling the current bus service problems and holding our transport partners to account on behalf of our residents, Councillor Healy added.

Margaret McDonald has been waiting since  to have the op done and claims she was the same weight - around -and-a-half stone - when she had surgery seven years ago on her other knee. The -year-old, from Anniesland, Glasgow, has osteoarthritis and said the pain is so severe in her knee she was prescribed morphine doses similar to someone dying from cancer. Sheaposs been presented for surgery by her GP multiple times in five years but each time a pre-op assessment at the Scottish cityaposs Queen Elizabeth Hospital has led to her being told she is too heavy. And despite attending reduced mobility exercise classes designed for OAPs seeing her lose over a stone, Margaret was still told her body mass index needs to come down.Have you had a similar issue to Margaret  Let us know at webnews@mirror A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde told the Mirror a BMI limit of  and under is a clinical requirement for this type of procedure. With Margaretaposs height of ftin, her BMI is around , meaning she just misses the cut off. NHS guidance also states while morbidly obese patients should not normally be listed for such an op, there can be exceptions when all reasonable attempts have been made to reduce weight and there are compelling circumstances. After doing her own research, Margaret said patients in similar circumstances have found some private orthopaedic surgeons will operate beyond the  threshold. She said each exercise class has left her bedridden for a day after due to knee inflammation, while a side-effect of the chronic depression medication she takes is weight gain. Margaretaposs psychiatrist has even been slowly reducing her dosage in an effort to help her sht the pounds - but she said losing a substantial amount in her condition is not possible. The grandmother-of-three said her le is like a permanent lockdown, and she even had to have her beloved dog Bruno re-homed because she couldnapost take him on walks.  I’ve lost my voluntary work that I used to do. I’ve lost doing things with my family, taking part in my grandkids’ activities. The impact it’s had on me has been incredible, she said. I’ve been presented for surgery three or four times but every time I was told no, BMI is too high. When you’re immobile and nothing much you can do regarding exercise what are you meant to do  I don’t just sit and eat my face off all day and not care about my weight. I just can’t sustain [any physical activities] because of pain and immobility. The impact on everyday le is just horrendous. Getting dressed, doing day-to-day things that you take for granted. Anytime I need anything I have to go online because I can’t even walk around the supermarket or go to a park, there’s nothing I can do. It’s like being in lockdown for five years. You’re just existing, that’s about it - it’s a horrible existence, she added. Margaretaposs daughter is her certied carer but has three young sons to look after as well and lives where. Prior to her mobility issues she said she was far more active and even taught first aid as a volunteer. She previously worked for the City of Glasgow College for  years and has been volunteering for the Scottish Police Authority, which she has been able to continue from home in the pandemic. An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokesman said: While we cannot comment on inidual patients, a BMI limit of  and under is a clinical requirement for us to proceed with procedures of this nature. We have every sympathy with patients who may struggle with their weight and provide advice and support to help reduce weight before surgery. Once BMI has been reduced, patients are reassessed with a view to progressing treatment. We are in touch with Ms McDonald and will work with her to achieve a positive outcome.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSHospitalsMental healthArthritisFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

ISS, who offer hospitality and catering management, has told the  schools it cooks meals for that it is having issues with the “sourcing, packing and distribution” of food supplies. The company added that “the problem will get worse and is likely to continue until at least February.In an email seen by ITV News, staff in ISS school kitchens have been urged to “top up on long le, dried, tinned and frozen products to ensure that there will always be some form of food available in a worse case scenario.”Schools are advised that ISS “is confident that their supply team will be able to provide product throughout.  However, they have been warned that menus could be changed at short notice because of the issues. ITV reported that jacket potatoes, which are easier to source, are the contingency plan as fish fingers are proving harder to source.

To celebrate the launch of Zinger Popcorn Bucket - available for a limited time only - we decided to champion people who like to spice things up, including Hannah Murphy, . When she reached a career crossroads in , Hannah struck out on a new adventurous course, and almost a decade on has no regrets about her bold decision. When I was made redundant from my eight-year career as a flight attendant, flying both domestically and between the UK and Japan, I saw it as an opportunity set myself a new challenge, and have new adventures, says Hannah who lives in Southampton with her husband and three children, Angelina, , Archie,  and Adriana, five. At the time I was a single mum of one after my previous relationship ended, and the ‘sensible’ decision would have been to take a - desk job, something stable but didnapost challenge me. That’s just not me though, I have to love what I do and find joy in it every day. Instead, Hannah trained as a fitness instructor and began to incorporate a hula hoop into her training. It wasn’t just a useful exercise tool, great for toning and core strength, it was so much fun. The moment I started hula hooping, I was transported back to my childhood, it was really liberating. As word got out about Hannah’s hula hooping prowess, friends and family began to ask for lessons, followed by requests from local schools for Hannah to come in and teach children how to hula hoop.  It snowballed and before I knew it, I had so much interest in hula hooping fitness classes, I had to train other instructors to help me. I went on to create a training programme called Globe Fit and today I have teachers all around the world, from Australia to America, all teaching my programme. I love teaching hula hooping, particularly adults, because they might start off a bit self-conscious and inhibited but soon their inner child is released and they just go for it! I’ve taught people aged from teenagers to eighty-year-olds. Last year, I hosted the first ever world hula hooping championship, which will be taking place again later this year. After launching the UKaposs first hula hooping championship in , which took place in Fareham, Hampshire, Hannah decided to go global in . Not even a pandemic could stop her with the event going virtual and around twenty-five competitors, women and men of all ages and abilities, taking part from as far afield as India, America and Australia. I had a  of four judges, including John Parnell aka Hoop Guy who appeared on Britainaposs Got Talent in . Competitors submitted videos of themselves performing with their hoop, and were marked on everything from skill to tricks they could do, with the  judging the videos.  The second world championship will take place in December this year, again virtually, and I hope to have even more people taking part. It’s amazing to be a part of people experiencing something new and fun, it doesn’t feel like work! Hannah’s story is a great example of how le can get better when you try something new, soyou already love Popcorn chicken - tasty pops of  per cent chicken breast, perfect to nibble on by themselves or as a side - then itaposs time to turn up the heat.

Ilayda Tomes, , who had been drinking in a restaurant, said she had offered two men a lt home to avoid them getting caught up in a fight outside with three women. But police spotted her silver C Class AMG vehicle clipping a kerb whilst being driven at mph in a mph zone. Tomes was stopped at the scene near her home in Wilmslow, Cheshire and found to be almost twice the alcohol limit.  At Stockport Magistratesapos Court, Tomes, a former art historian who helped assist special needs children at a school in Holmes Chapel, wept as she admitted driving with excess alcohol. She was banned from driving for  months and fined £ with £ costs. She is now working as a dental receptionist. The court heard how the incident occurred after Tomes, formerly of Antalya, Turkey, had been pressured into drinking alcohol by friends during an evening out. Her lawyer Stuart Thomson said: She had been out at a restaurant for a meal with friends but does not usually drink for religious reasons.  Her friends have pressured her into drinking and she has had drank two glasses of wine. She did not feel any dferent and thought she would be okay to drive. She felt no dferent than what she normally would. She went to get into her vehicle when she saw two men and three women arguing physically and verbally. She intervened because she is a previous victim of domestic violence and offered to give the males a lt, so they did not follow the three females. That is why she was driving at that speed. She had only driven around . miles. The only time she has drank previously was at her graduation some years ago. She has not drunk since this incident. She is now working as a receptionist at a dental surgery for the last two months.  She did have a job she was due to start on  September as a teaching assistant however, because she had been arrested for this matter, she had now lost that job as a teaching assistant. That has now gone because of this offence.She is of previous good character and is visibly upset in court today. She is remorseful and is very unlikely to ever drink again. This defendant has no previous convictions and was not on bail for any other matter. She is absolutely devastated and upset that she is here today. Earlier prosecutor Gareth Hughes said: At .am on Aug  police were on patrol when they spotted a silver Mercedes. The police were stationary at the time but they saw this defendant turn onto a roundabout before clipping a kerb. She was travelling at  mph in a  mph zone. Police pulled up along side the vehicle at a junction. They have then spoken to the driver and conducted a road side test where she has then given a positive reading. Tests showed Tomes had  micrograms of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit is mg. Sentencing, JP Mayor Shah told Tomes: It is your first time in court, do not worry, we are not going to lock you up.

Temperatures will remain fine in the south through the weekend, rivalling destinations that are usually sunnier and warmer at this time of year. But western Scotland is under a yellow warning for rain, where as much as ins could fall over higher ground through Friday and into Saturday morning.Brits should make the most of the unseasonably warm October weather - the long-term forecast calls for things to turn colder and snow to fall over higher ground in the UK as the month moves into November. Temperatures are predicted to hit at least C in a number of places in England and Wales on Friday, with some towns or cities nearing C. Barcelona and Los Angeles are both expected to hit highs of about C. Brighter skies and warm weather are set to be maintained until at least Sunday as sub-tropical is drawn in from the South West. But downpours are forecast for parts of Scotland and Wales. The heaviest showers are expected in western Scotland, where a yellow warning is in effect.On Friday, there could be some fog or low cloud in the morning, which will clear to allow for some warm sunshine for many, though it will stay cloudier in the South East, the Met Office said. Met Office five-day weather forecast Friday Rain continuing in the northwest but tending to ease, and clearing from Northern Ireland.

Crook, , shocked drivers over the course of five miles at around .am on October ,  as she reached speeds of almost mph. Chris Hopkins, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court that passing drivers used their lights and horns in a bid to get the attention of Crook.  Crook was seen driving westbound on the East Lancashire Road as she passed through Windle Island in St Helens. At the junction with Moorgate Road she entered the lane to turn right, only to continue straight and drive into oncoming traffic on the wrong side of the barrier separating the carriageways. Crook then turned down the M slip road, almost hitting a lorry head on before joining the motorway and driving at traffic heading in the opposite direction. The court heard the vehicle in front of Ms Kingdonaposs Honda Jazz swerved to get out of Crookaposs way, leaving the -year-old with no opportunity to avoid a crash. Shortly before the crash, one witness said: He could see her hands on the steering wheel. She was looking forward and appeared to be driving in a determined manner. Mr Hopkins said Crookaposs intentions remained unclear, but added: All of the evidence indicates this was a deliberate act and the only sensible conclusion that can be drawn is that the defendant was trying to harm herself.  Ms Kingdon and Crook both had to be cut out of their vehicles and taken to Aintree Hospital. Crook, of Cheviot Avenue in St Helens, spent time in a critical condition but survived. When interviewed by police, Crook said she had no recollection of the incident and suggested she had taken a wrong turn and panicked. Mr Hopkins said: The fact that that explanation is maintained by the defendant is something which has caused great distress to family members of the victim. The court heard Crook could offer no reason for a collection of photographs of motorway junctions, bridges and crash scenes that were recovered from her mobile phone. Mr Hopkins read a powerful statement on behalf of Stephen Sharples, the brother of Ms Kingdon. He detailed the compassion his sister displayed and the positive impact she had on so many lives through her work in education.  Ms Kingdon was from Merseyside but lived in Sheffield and had been the headteacher of Westfield Infants School, near Chesterfield, in Derbyshire. She was killed while she was driving home after visiting her Kirkby-based father-in-law, who she helped care for several days a week, and after having seen Liverpool FC play. Mr Sharples said: After a le time of devoting herself to others, Paula deserved the chance to enjoy her retirement... it is heartbreaking to me that Paula had this opportunity for a new chapter in her le taken away by the senseless actions of this stranger. Sarah Grfin, defending, said her client had previously been a woman of positive good character who had worked all her le, who is clearly dedicated to her children and is someone who could regularly be found helping family, friends and neighbours. Ms Grfin said Crook had not driven since the crash, and planned to never drive again.Judge Garrett Byrne addressed Ms Kingdonaposs family as he told the court: No sentence can restore Paula and no sentence can possibly compensate for her loss.The judge told Crook: The manner of your driving was such that it is dficult to think of a more serious case.He said: In my view the collision can be properly characterised as a deliberate act. You must have realised at the time that your driving was bound to cause someone at least serious harm,not their death. A letter written to Judge Byrne by Crook ended with her claiming she had no explanation for her actions. Highlighting the evidence that Crook made no attempt to avoid a crash, he concluded it was not a case of taking a wrong turn and then panicking, it was a deliberate course of conduct. The judge added that,it had been Crookaposs intention to harm herself, it was a profoundly selfish one because you were prepared to injure or kill others in achieving that goal. Crook admitted one count of causing death by dangerous driving. She was sentenced to four years and eight months and disqualied from driving for three years after her release.

The image was shared online with the caption: “I shouldn’t laugh, but I’m going to…”A photo of the note was shared on Reddit and Instagram where many people presumed it to be a joke and found it hilarious.Many people seemed to presume the note was a joke, with one person commenting: “There’s a Jesus take the wheel joke in this somewhere”. Another pointed out: “Jesus has never driven a car before so he might actually park like that”. And another Reddit user cheekily said: “The Church of England wants a word”.It comes just days after a pair of furious sistersvoiced their angerat having notes stuck to their windscreens with glue and silicone after parking on a residential street.Ellie Newman, , and sister Jordana Timeyin, , park their matching Range Rover Velars on a street close to where they work in Manchester - but said they were shocked by the criminal damage. The sisters, who both work at nearby Loan Agency Bridgewater Acceptances, say their cars have repeatedly been targeted. On Thursday Ellie claims she discovered a note stuck with silicone to the windscreen of her black Range Rover after she finished work. The note in black felt tip pen read: Please stop using this street as a car park. Residents are coming home from work shopping and can not park on their own street!! But Ellie said she and sister Jordana are perfectly within their rights to park there, as they both pay tax. She said: There are no yellow lines. We work in the area and this is what we pay road tax for. Our offices have been there  years. This has happened about four times. We have had our car scratched and around four notes left, stuck on with super glue, gaffer tape and now silicone. This is criminal damage.  According to the official RAC parking guide: It is perfectly legal to park outside someone’s house, unless the vehicle is blocking a driveway or a wheel is over a dropped kerb. Other situations in which parking isn’t permitted include streets governed by residents’ parking permits or any of the restrictions outlined above, i.e. double yellow lines. Ellie says she has logged the incident to the police online.

He didnapost even sit he just started going around shaking guests hands and handing them small cards which turned out to be his wedding invitations. I was upset but couldnapost interrupt the ceremony but obviously people were distracted which was awful. The ceremony was over and he was still handing out his wedding invitations and talking about how his wedding will look like from the atmosphere, the venue, etc - basically putting my wedding down in every way he could. I walked straight up to him and asked what he was doing. The men then got into an argument and the brother-in-law began hurling insults, before being asked to leave. The groom continued: I lost it on him and told him to leave immediately. His fiancee and my mother-in-law came and tried to get me to drop it but I told him to leave right then.

The tri-coloured pup held her poorly paw off the ground as her mum asked: “Your leg’s broken ” The shepherd nearly gives the game away as she leaps up to greet her owner and hops around the kitchen wagging her tail.  Her owner, a dog trainer and breeder from Massachusetts, asks the dog: “Shade, do you think you’re gonna make it  Are you dead ” Shade dramatically flops onto her back, and plays ‘dead’, but quickly lets her owner know she was only joking, and just wants a treat.Thevideo- posted to the @telltaleaussie account - has been viewed , times in  hours, with over a thousand comments who can’t believe how dedicated she was to her acting role.One said: “That’s a death dropever I’ve seen one.”Fetch.

from throughout Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire to take part in its online Mock COP project on October .Mirroring the format of the real-le event, which will run from October  to November , the project will task the children with taking part in discussions, negotiations, and votes on important climate issues.The children will be ided into small teams, and each one will represent a body, or “actor”, that will be at COP, for example a country, a special interest group, or a corporation.It is hoped that by getting involved in the pretend event, the pupils will gain insight into the complexities and importance of climate change negotiations before the real-le conference starts a few days later.Professor David Burslem, from the university’s School of Biological Sciences, has been involved in organising the Mock COP initiative.He said: “COP is a hugely signicant event, particularly as it is taking place in Scotland, and we want to ensure that we maximise the opportunities for our students, staff and the wider community here in the north-east of Scotland.“Getting young people excited by and engaged with COP is our main priority, which is why we are holding a Mock COP for local school pupils, helping them gain an insight as to what is happening in the negotiations and taking them on an important journey through climate change negotiations, the actors involved, and the problems faced.”Aberdeen University also plans to place a time capsule in its Cruickshank Botanic Gardens which will contain, along with other items, messages from primary school kids about their hopes for the environment.It will be put in place on November , the final day of COP, and reopened in .The university will also be carrying out a number of initiatives with its staff and students to encourage them to engage with COP such as an online “Hackathon” where students will share ideas to tackle climate change.Online seminars hosted by experts in their fields exploring topics like renewable energy, transport, climate change and the push for net zero will also be held.Karl Leydecker, vice-principal at the university, said: “Academically, we are world leaders in climate science and energy transition, and it is important that the university is visible in discussions and activities around COP that seek to engage our students, staff, and the wider community.”For as little as £. a month

wins against Austria and Moldova.His most recent outing was at the start of last month’s triple-header when he was substituted at half-time in the - defeat against Denmark in Copenhagen.With Grant Hanley suspended for the visit of Israel, McKenna hopes he can force his way back into the line-up but the former Don knows competition for places is fierce.The -year-old said: “It might open things up but Scott McTominay is back and we have Liam Cooper, Jack Hendry and Kieran Tierney.“There are lots of options for the manager to pick from.“I have always said it is far better having competition than lads playing because that is all that is there.“There are five or six players fighting for those two positions and it means the team will be in a better position because of that.”McKenna admits he had little complaints with being left out of the team for the wins against Austria and Moldova.He said: “The boys have been excellent in the last two games.“We’ve had two clean sheets and I wouldn’t expect too much change.“If I am asked to play I will be ready.“I know the boys who have come in have done well and I fully understand it.“Even when you are away from the camp you know the manager or somebody will be watching for him.“Even at club level you have to keep doing what you can to show him what you can do.“The fact we kept a clean sheet at the weekend and stopped conceding as many goals at club level should help the manager put a bit more faith in me.”McKenna is on  caps for his country and would love to make it to the -cap milestone during this international window with Scotland heading to the Faroe Islands on Tuesday following their home match against Israel.He said: “I am only a couple away from that.“It would be a great achievement to reach  caps but I am not too fussed when that comes.“I would rather it was sooner than later but I would rather be in a winning squad, with everyone doing well than just focusing on myself.”McKenna is delighted to see his former Aberdeen teammate Lewis Ferguson in the squad and felt the former Hamilton Accies player, who was the subject of a transfer bid from English Premier League side Watford in the summer, was always destined to be a Scotland international.He said: “Fergie has been excellent at Aberdeen for a number of years now.“It was only ever a matter of time before he got called up.“Centre midfield has been a strong area for the national team but he’s fully deserving of being in the squad.”Scotland sit second in Group F with  points from their opening six games following last month’s win in Austria with Israel only a point behind.But McKenna hopes a sold-out Hampden can help the national team take a step closer to a second place finish that would guarantee a World Cup play-off spot.mdash Scotland National TeamOctober , He said: “On the back of the Austra result, we still have that buzz and we want to carry that into this game now.“A full house at Hampden is exciting.“I remember when we played there against Israel in the Nations League and how empty it was that night.“It’s a sign of how far we’ve come as a squad and a team that Hampden is now sold out for this one.“So this will be special andwe can get a positive result it’ll put us in control of the group ahead of the Faroes trip and then Moldova.“So hopefully we can get the business done.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

The P  team drew six tries-all and the P- team won by six tries to four.Next they played Kintyre with the P s losing by five tries to two and the P s winning again four tries to three.The last game for both teams came against Oban and this time the P  team won by three tries to one and the superb P  team won by five tries to three to complete a clean sweep on the day.Lee Buckley of Mid Argyll RFC said: #The coaches at Mid Argyll would like to thank two under- players, Donald Self and William Wilson, who came along on the day and refereed all the games.#I think the boys were surprised by the quality of the rugby and the speed of some of the mini players, as they tried to keep up with them.#During the day Argyll and Bute rugby development officer Andrew Johnston took all the girl players aside to record a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team who took on Spain the following day in a crucial world cup qualying match.The message must have done the trick as Scotland ran out  #  victors to keep their world cup dream alive.If any young people would like to play rugby either as a ing player or a complete novice, training sessions for all primary age children and S- high school girls is at pm on Tuesdays on the rugby pitch at the joint campus in Lochgilphead.High School training for S- boys and girls is held on Thursdays at pm at the joint campus.For any ing ex-players or novice adults, men and women who want to give rugby a try for the first time, have a look on Mid Argyll Rugby Club#s Facebook page for details of when the #old-timers# touch rugby sessions are being held.This week#s Dalriada festival on September  is being hosted by Oban Lorne RFC.Players should arrive at Oban Rugby Club no later than .am for a noon start.PICS:Mid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllMid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllDonald and William refereed the games. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllThe girls had a great day # and even recorded a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllAction from the P  match between Mid Argyll and Etive Vikings, which Mid Argyll won by six tries to four.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn. Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces, and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is Heuchera.Native to north America, Heuchera were originally grown for their flowers # dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and wpring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"glendaruel hosts tighnabruaich open","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowGlendaruel and Colintraive Gun Club hosted the Tighnabruaich Open on September , the first club competition to be held since March .The High Gun of the day, after a three-way shoot off, was Ted Blakeway.In second was Alan Brown third, Paul Chalmers and fourth equal were Martin Young,  Gordon Grfiths and Eric McAllister.The ladies prize went to Jessica Young.

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn.Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent

The card had superior artistic merit and I wanted to make use of it in the book, which was to include a number of old cards by the celebrated North Berwick postcard artist Reginald Phillimore.The problem, however, was that no information was forthcoming where this obscure cottage had been or how it had earnt sufficient fame to be depicted by Phillimore.The book was published in  without lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo being featured.The purchase of another Edwardian postcard belatedly solved the mystery in August : it turned out that the careless Phillimore had got the name wrong, since it was not lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo but lsquoCleikimin Tollrsquo!And indeed, inquiries demonstrated that this turnpike and tollhouse had been standing at the cross between the road from Dunbar to Spott and the road from Broxburn to Belton. It is likely there were two turnpikes, one on each road. The tollhouse was said to be very old, quite possibly constructed in the first half of the th century.In early Victorian times, the tollgate system kept flourishing all over Britain. In rural west Wales, there were full-scale riots in  after a number of novel turnpikes had been erected, something the locals disapproved of. Men dressed as women attacked the turnpikes and beat up the tollkeepers, and it was only with dficulty they could be pacied.Cleikimin Toll was spared such indignities, however: it was still operational at the time of the Ordnance Survey of -. The name-book of this survey [OS    ] refers to it as a ldquoA Toll Bar at a junction of roads situated about half a mile south of the town of Dunbar.A note explains Cleikimin as a name usually applied to a cheap public house, where a Cleik [Scottish for fish-hook] was supposed to have been made use of to pull the customers inside.The arrival of the railways did much damage to the old tollgate system all over Britain: as a result, the road toll revenue plummeted and the tollkeepers grumbled incessantly.The Scottish municipal authorities realised the old-fashioned turnpikes were on the way out, and by  they were all gone.The tollhouse at Cleikimin Toll stood well into Edwardian times, being admired as a quaint relic of olden days.

That is simply not the case. Reduced emissions are achieved by changing company strategy, government policy and inidual choices. The fund is concentrating on real world decarbonisation outcomes, not virtue signalling.\"The spokesman also pointed out that the fund owns a higher percentage of assets in renewables than it does in traditional fossil fuel energy companies.ldquoWhat we know about the transition is that it will be long and complex. Fossil fuels will, in fact, be required in signicant quantity to effect the transition that we all want,\" the fund said.Fund chief exectuiveDavid Vallery said:ldquoWe support the transition to a carbon free economy and at LPF we are confident we are doing our part. We use ourinvestments and engage with companies seeking positivechange and invest in wind, solar and hydro to provide renewable alternatives.The Lothian Pension Fund is the second largest local government pension scheme in Scotland and administers the pension funds of over , members from The City of Edinburgh Council and three other local authorities in the Lothians. It also manages the pensions of  employers, including Scottish Water, Edinburgh Napier University, Lothian Buses and Heriot Watt University.The study carried out by Friends of the Earth Scotland checked the fund for investments against the Carbon Underground  - a list of the largest owners of carbon reserves.Iain Struthers from Divest Lothian said: \"It is deeply inconsistent and morally unjustiable that Edinburgh City Council is positioning itself to be a zero-carbon city by , but with no mention of esting its interests in fossil fuels.\"Stakeholder engagement will never change the core business model of polluting companies.

Proposals also include “active travel” routes, e-bike chargers and welcome facilities, alongside coach permits and charging at some car parks.The programme is being funded with joint investment of up to £. million from the Scottish Government and UK Government, as part of the Islands Growth Deal — a ten-year investment programme jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments, the three island councils and their partners from the public, academic and business sectors.During the in-person sessions, due to take place next Tuesday and Wednesday, attendees will be guided through proposals with representatives from project partners.OIC leader, Councillor James Stockan, said: “The Islands Deal commitment we have from the Scottish and UK Governments to support the Orkney Gateway is hugely gratying and reflects the position our World Heritage Site holds as one of the jewels in Scotland’s and indeed the UK’s tourism crown — not to mention the global archaeological signicance of the site.“But we must remember that at the core of this is a landscape and series of monuments which for many Orcadians is a direct, mysterious and powerful link to their past.

Safety is paramount and although the vehicle used will be capable of driving itself, a driver will be present at all times to take controlrequired.Widespread use of self-driving vehicles is expected by next decade and the findings of the project will be used to determine how countries across Europe can effectively implement them # including considering how they fit in with green transport and spatial planning strategies, as well as likely socio-economic impacts.Representatives from the project partners will be in attendance including HITRANS , More Work Less Carbon — a company based in Utrecht, Netherlands, who will supply the AVs — and Robert Gordon University.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4140772.jpg--.jpg?1633611240000\n","title":"children in school bus collision traumatised parent","story":"A parent of youngsters who were travelling on the school bus caught up in a serious traffic collision this morning on the Cullybackey Road says he fears that a number of children will have been traumatised by the incident.

The Chief Medical Officer, Professor Sir Michael McBride, and Chief Pharmaceutical Officer, Cathy Harrison, recently officially launched this year’s community pharmacy flu vaccination programme and have received their flu jab in Belfast.The seasonal influenza programme officially began on October , ,and this year the programme is being expanded to help protect the most vulnerable people in our society and to relieve the winter pressures being faced by the health service during the ongoing COVID- pandemic.The rollout of the seasonal flu vaccination programme in Northern Ireland will be supported by community pharmacies across the province who will be offering the vaccine to: All adults aged  years and over as well as all HSC workers.Speaking at Balmoral Pharmacy, the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Sir Michael McBride, said: “The COVID- pandemic continues to place signicant demands and pressures on our Health Service and we expect that there will be circulation of both flu and COVID- this winter, which will inevitably add further pressures on our already fragile health care system.“As a result of the low flu activity last winter we expect reduced levels of population immunity against the virus this winter.“In the situation where social mixing and social contacttowards pre-pandemic norms, it is expected that this winter will be the first winter in the UK when seasonal flu and other respiratory viruses such as RSV in children will circulate alongside COVID-.“Modelling indicates the   flu season in the UK could be up to % larger than typically seen and it is also possible that the  to  influenza season will begin earlier than usual. Influenza vaccination is therefore an important priority this coming autumn to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with influenza, and to reduce hospitalisations during a time when the health service may also be managing signicant winter outbreaks of COVID-. Please keep following the public advice to reduce the transmission of flu and COVID-, please get the vaccines and protect yourself, those that matter to you and the health service.”The extension of the community pharmacy role in the   flu vaccination programme will offer an additional route to vaccination for all HSC workers and for all those aged  and over, complimenting existing Occupational Health services and GP services, in order to maximise uptake of the flu vaccine.Chief Pharmaceutical Officer, Mrs Cathy Harrison, said: “Community pharmacists are highly trained healthcare professionals and have continued to play a pivotal role delivering health services to communities in Northern Ireland during the pandemic.“I am delighted to welcome this expanded role for community pharmacy teams, which builds on the success of last year’s community pharmacy flu vaccination service and the COVID- vaccination programme, which has seen over , doses of COVID- vaccine administered in community pharmacies all across Northern Ireland.“This service will complement the already strong arrangements for delivering the flu vaccination programme in Trusts and general practice. And will use the skills of community pharmacy teams to provide much needed additional capacity across the healthcare system to deliver the largest flu vaccination programme ever at the same time as the COVID- booster vaccination programme and maintaining provision of other essential HSC services.”Chief Executive of Community Pharmacy NI, Gerard Greene, said: “Community pharmacies across Northern Ireland welcome the expansion of the Community Pharmacy flu vaccination service, it gives the public the option of getting their flu vaccine at a convenient, accessible location with a local pharmacist they know and trust.

Credit: PAWhat about mask wearing The Executive did not make any specic changes to the current rules around mask wearing in certain indoor settings such as public transport.The requirement to wear face coverings in certain settings is being retained as part of the Executive’s winter contingency plans.There is no indication as yet though how this requirement will operate when hospitality settings fully reopen at the end of this month, with the latest rules from the Executive specying the requirement to wear one will be retained in “certain settings, such as in shops, shopping centres and public transport”.What about vaccine certicates The Executive did not make the use of a vaccine certicate mandatory for people to access hospitality venues at the end of this month.Instead, they will ask event organisers and venues to voluntarily introduce entry systems requiring patrons to either prove full vaccination or a negative lateral flow test, or evidence of a Covid infection within the previous six months.During the meeting, it is understood ministers were told by officials that indoor seated venues that have introduced vaccine test proof entry requirements in recent weeks have seen a % compliance rate among patrons.Ministers did confirm that the option of having a certication system is being considered as part of potential winter contingency planscases begin to rise.They said plans to have a Covid vaccine certicate “in certain settings” are being considered as part of those contingencies.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said she does not “want to go down the mandatory route”.First Minister Paul Givan said he hopes a voluntary arrangement with the hospitality industry “will work”.Read MoreLeaders rule out mandatory jab passportsWhat the political leaders said:Speaking to the media after the announcement of the changes, First Minister Paul Givan said he was “pleased” about the changes agreed.There will be three areas left that will be the wearing of face coverings in some limited areas, when it comes to the retention of risk assessments and also the retention of data around visitors to venues and hospitality,” he said.They will be low-level mitigation measures which will stay in law, there will be guidance when it comes to a lot of the sectors that are operating across our society and economy that will remain in place in a voluntary guidance format.By the end of October we will have moved to the point where there are three areas that we will continue to look at over the course of the winter and will likely remain as low-level regulatory interventions.On October  we will have changes in terms of numbers around the domestic settings and tourist accommodation. That will be limited still in respect of house parties and raves. That will happen on October  and the remaining areas then at the end of October.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill referenced the progress that has been made but sounded a note of caution on the months ahead.There are measures which we don#t want to be in a place to introduce but we have to be ready for that just in case we get to that point,” she said.We#re in for an uncertain period ahead and we have to work our way through that as best we can.We#re going to do everything we can to avoid getting to that point.”Most ReadTop Northern Ireland hotel sold in £m deal to US investment giantFamily’s grief after Belfast dad of four is electrocuted in work accident… we recalls last time they spokeEssex lorry deaths: How ancient phone battery nailed Northern Ireland gang responsible for loss of  migrantsGeorge Best family won’t allow footballer’s name to be used for Belfast hotelArlene’s new job: women’s magazine columnistTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: Man sets himself on fire at City Hall, Belfast WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENTPlaySeven travellers brought Covid to Northern Ireland, says QUB studyLatest CoronavirusLeaders rule out mandatory jab passportsCoronavirus NI: Ending social distancing will help hospitality ‘bounce back’Coronavirus NI: Social distancing to be dropped for pubs and restaurants with nightclubs set to reopenMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageIreland rugby’s % Covid vaccine impact puts Northern Ireland and Republic football in spotlightLatestAlf McCrearyOpinionWhy there’s hope for Christianity in Ireland‘The one where they say I do’: Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid to bring Friends to Derry weddingBelfast Giants won#t hide behind excuses for dropping points, insists defenceman Sam RuoppJohn Schofield believes Under-s are primed to tear up away day scriptOne in six unable to buy essential food items due to shortages, research finds,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

city centre projectExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDevelopment: The site of the George Best Hotel in Belfast city centre FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDevelopment: The site of the George Best Hotel in Belfast city centreAllan PrestonTwitterEmailOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe family of George Best have withdrawn permission for developers to name a Belfast hotel after the Manchester United and Northern Ireland football legend from the east of the city.It follows an announcement in July that local businessmen were working to finish the troubled project which had been hit by financial delays.Work on the George Best Hotel in the historic Scottish Mutual Building at Donegall Square stalled in April  when the owners, Bedford Hotels Ltd, a subsidiary of Liverpool-based Signature Living Hotels Ltd, went bankrupt, leaving investors owed millions.In July, a -strong group of investors announced they would collaborate with Signature Living’s owner, Lawrence Kenwright, to save the development and their investments.However, on Wednesday night, the directors of the George Best company, the late footballer’s family, said they wanted to clary their position, and said that they were not among those investors.“The family terminated all connections with Signature Living earlier this year and in fact are in amongst the creditors currently being handled by the official receiver,” they said in a statement.“Furthermore they have not and will not be committing George’s name to any proposed redevelopment of the site as may have been construed in the article referred to above.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The family added that they “maintain their belief” in the ultimate potential of a hotel “and desire to see a successful scheme completed in the city”.In July, Mr Kenwright said he invited the new group of investors to become part of the George Best Hotel property company, hoping their combined weight would make it easier to get funding to complete the hotel.The group is now chaired by Co Antrim businessman Stephen Kearney, who will now oversee refinancing and development, with Mr Kenwright taking on the role of CEO.After originally investing in the hotel in , he admitted in July that it had been “a turbulent journey” for Signature Living but there was now hope the matter could be resolved with the George Best Hotel administration.The GB Hotel group is also being advised by another Northern Irish businessman, Thomas Scullion, who is himself a Signature Living investor. He is the chair of the UK Accommodation Group , which he set up with fellow investors to restructure Signature Living#s operations last September.Mr Kearney had said that UKAG had “mobilised the vast majority of unsecured investors in supporting Lawrence Kenwright and have worked diligently on a recovery plan”, and said that “crucially Lawrence has handed over control” of operations.Mr Kenwright had admitted he was “ceding controland giving them final say in decisions”. He added: “We have faced a unique set of circumstances in trying to finish the George Best Hotel and I am extremely grateful for this support.”Signature Living did not respond to a request for comment by time of going to press on Wednesday night..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and

Seventeen elected members voted in favour, from the DUP, the PUP and the UUP, while  Alliance members abstained.The decision went against recommendations from council officers, who advised the council should give the £, to the Confucius Institute.The council’s Director of Economic Development told a committee the institute had been “working closely with those NI councils that are engaged in activity within China, and had greatly assisted Belfast City Council in its work with sister city Shenyang since ”.The director said the institute “had engaged with the council to explore the potential to enter into a memorandum of understanding in order to formalise the support services and agree an outline activity plan” and “considered that this approach would help them manage resources more effectively”.Councillor Lyons told the chamber: “In appreciating Chinese culture I do not appreciate bits of it being eroded to suit the political agenda of the organisation that finances this institute.”He said: “This is about creating a memorandum of understanding about formalised support services – I don’t know what that means. To agree on an activity of events – what are these events, and what are the aims of these events  What is the content of them  The report doesn’t go into any of this.”He added: “And I won’t take lessons on needless snubs from the DUP – lessons on needlessly insulting our international family, as well as brothers and sisters from a dferent city. I find that a bit hypocritical.”SDLP Councillor Seamus De Faoite told the council there had been concerns raised “on the issue of espionage.” He said: “I will quote the MP Fiona Bruce directly when she says there are “serious concerns about the presence of the Confucius Institute on university campuses within the UK”.“That follows on from concerns from the US state department regarding the Confucius Institute and their role in universities there, in terms of suppressing freedom of speech and effectively propagating the institutions of the Chinese Communist party in other countries.“We cannot orce our international relations and connections of this city from any of the issues around human rights abuses and concerns we have in relation to China, or in fact any other country.”He added: “I think it is very important we orce the idea of the Chinese government being representative of the Chinese people. Similarly for other people around the world – they are not necessarily represented by the government of the jurisdiction in which they live.“I think it is also very important we don’t confuse those issues, in an attempt to suggest any opposition to the Confucius Institute and its presence in Belfast is in any way some kind of latent racism.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadTop Northern Ireland hotel sold in £m deal to US investment giantFamily’s grief after Belfast dad of four is electrocuted in work accident… we recalls last time they spokeEssex lorry deaths: How ancient phone battery nailed Northern Ireland gang responsible for loss of  migrantsGeorge Best family won’t allow footballer’s name to be used for Belfast hotelArlene’s new job: women’s magazine columnistTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: Man sets himself on fire at City Hall, Belfast WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENTPlaySeven travellers brought Covid to Northern Ireland, says QUB studyLatest News HeadlinesExecutive publishes y report on actions taken over RHI scandalDay for the ducks in Derry as it’s named wettest place in UKCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three deaths and , new positive casesToday#s headlines: Ex-spook bids to uncover Troubles secrets, PSNI#s response to Everard case and end of era for French bistroTributes as much-loved vet Maurice King passes awayLatest‘The one where they say I do’: Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid to bring Friends to Derry weddingBelfast Giants won#t hide behind excuses for dropping points, insists defenceman Sam RuoppIreland finalise their -man squad for the Twenty World CupGiant panda cubs at Tokyo zoo given names ahead of public debutGMB presenter Charlotte Hawkins discusses her symptoms of long Covid,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mothers, fathers, farmers waking up and beginning their day. A young man going out on his morning run.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Children with Down’s Syndrome eating breakfast with their family. We see a teacher, a baker, a florist, a taxi-driver, a greengrocer, a shelf-stacker, a working mum — baby in her arms — as the day progresses.It all moves along to an upbeat song specially commissioned for the party. This is “Eurovision meets unionism”, as the commentator David McCann quipped. It’s utterly inclusive and the positive vibe is infectious.Even the opposition was impressed. Alliance’s Belfast Lord Mayor, Kate Nicholl, watched it with her two-year-old son. “He started crying when it stopped so we had to watch it again,” she tweeted.Doug Beattie has put clear red, white and blue water between himself and the DUP and TUV.The video is meant to reflect his ‘Union of the people’. Not unionists as they’re often represented in the media or by some politicians — always angry, negative, and fearful — but as ordinary folk living their lives the same as everyone . There is no single stereotype that fits.The mood in the broadcast is a million miles from that of angry protesters on the streets lambasting the protocol or those wanting to turn the clock back to another century.It’s grounded in Northern Ireland , and it’s forward looking. Never has a political leader in Northern Ireland altered the image of his party so rapidly.Beattie is just four months in the job, and the pace of change is phenomenal.There have been new, high-profile recruits an Assembly candidate from a working-class nationalist background and a drive to bring in more women, although the party has a long way to go on the journey to gender equality.Beattie will address his first annual conference in Belfast tomorrow. The most welcome guest will be hope.In just four months, the new leader appears on course to do what has eluded his predecessors over almost two decades — reverse the UUP’s decline.It has long been on the back foot. Despite Red Sky, RHI and the alphabet soup of scandals that have hit its rival, it has never been able to land a blow on the DUP.For the first time in a long time, there is excitement and confidence in the party’s ranks.The UUP is up from % to % in LucidTalk opinion polls since he took up the reins. That helps the new leader hugely. Success breeds success winning becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.But there are dangers too. Some observers believe the ‘Beattie bounce’ is over-hyped. It’s one thing changing the party’s image and making gains in the polls. Transforming its fortunes by securing votes in an actual election is a trickier matter.The weight of expectation now lies on Beattie’s shoulders. He certainly can’t be accused of playing it safe. Every unionist leader at one point or another talks of the need to change, few have followed through.There are risks involved. How will the latest party broadcast go down with traditional UUP members in rural areas Beattie’s views don’t always chime with conservative grassroots members, although his personal popularity, military background and those positive poll results help him with that section of the party.But a good Assembly election result next May is crucial for his leadership. The UUP must win more seats in Stormont. The boldest, bravest party broadcasts, with the catchiest tunes, need to deliver votes to succeed..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsDoug BeattieUlster Unionist PartyAlliance PartyMore On Doug BeattieWatch: UUP broadcast video features girl playing with hurling stick in appeal beyond traditional voter base PremiumUUP’s Doug Beattie: Why I wouldn’t have posed with Hutchings PremiumUlster Unionists must improve its gender imbalance, says leader Doug Beattie PremiumGail WalkerOpinionJoint statement by unionist leaders was signicant... the smart move now would be to open a Dublin office PremiumJon TongeOpinionWhy a unionist pact is as likely as a merger of the Blues and the GlensMost ReadTop Northern Ireland hotel sold in £m deal to US investment giantFamily’s grief after Belfast dad of four is electrocuted in work accident… we recalls last time they spokeEssex lorry deaths: How ancient phone battery nailed Northern Ireland gang responsible for loss of  migrantsGeorge Best family won’t allow footballer’s name to be used for Belfast hotelArlene’s new job: women’s magazine columnistTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: Man sets himself on fire at City Hall, Belfast WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENTPlaySeven travellers brought Covid to Northern Ireland, says QUB studyLatest Northern Ireland‘The one where they say I do’: Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid to bring Friends to Derry weddingGlenavon can slam brakes on Coleraine’s winning run: Stephen LowryDavid Jeffrey admits he is in the middle of his toughest fight as Ballymena bossUlster Unionist Party video features girl playing hurling in appeal beyond traditional voter baseNI traffic alerts: British Road, Aldergrove closed after crash and A Belfast to Dublin road reopenedLatest‘The one where they say I do’: Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid to bring Friends to Derry weddingJournalists handed Nobel Peace Prize for fight for freedom of expressionMystery remains over cause of Calornia oil pipeline leakCalornia fires may have killed hundreds of giant sequoiasBrighton Pier owner settles £m pandemic insurance claims,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:n When you need the moneyn How long you want it to last for, andn How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing. Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

It started with  pupils in a scout centre.  In this article the Principal of Oakgrove Integrated College, Katrina Crilly, explains why she is so passionate about her school and about its founding principles that, she says, are all about teaching pupils respect for the ersity that’s out there... googletag.cmd.push  As many of you probably know, integrated education here has been around for a long time. This year it’s celebrating its ruby anniversary - it’s  years since Lagan College was established in Belfast. Last week we celebrated this by inviting the Mayor and MP for Foyle to unveil our banner. Surprisingly, despite recent media coverage about the founding of Lagan, it would seem that integration is still largely misunderstood. Here in Northern Ireland  North of Ireland, it’s taken to mean a school where Catholic and Protestant children are educated together. It’s much, much more than that. In today’s global world, we’re confronted with a whole host of ersity: dferent cultures, dferent religions, dferent skin colours. Here at our school, Oakgrove College, we prepare our students to meet and deal with that ersity by providing a learning environment where children and young people from all faiths and none can learn with, about and most importantly from each other. Acceptance and respect for all are key concepts in everything we do. Our desire for every child who joins the Oakgrove family is the promotion of equality, and that must include the forging good relations with everyone in the school and their families regardless of their religious, cultural, social or other background. Integrated education is, at its core, value-driven and child centred. It is delivered through a holistic approach.     Our world, as I have pointed out, is full of ersity that’s the natural law, and so children deserve the opportunity to flourish in that erse environment both at school and in wider society. How  are children supposed to learn about other cultures and backgrounds enough that they understand and accept dference as a natural part of le  We are about preparing children for le and work, providing children with a very real experience of living and working successfully alongside people from dferent backgrounds and beliefs. Many believe that all schools are integrated, but what they actually mean is that they are “mixed”. The two are very dferent. Dferent backgrounds Many schools accept children from dferent faiths and backgrounds and, yes, they are educated alongside each other and under one roof. However, the school does not change its ethos or identity for that child, there is an understanding that the child can attend however the school’s religious ethos remains the same and the child “fits in”. In some respects, the child sacrices their identity to attend the school. In an integrated school, no child has to sacrice their identity to attend, as all backgrounds and faiths, and all our dferences are celebrated and nurtured. At an integrated school no child has to deny his her culture, background or religion. Imagine a place where you can honestly be yourself, where your dference is celebrated as the norm, and where you grow in the knowledge and understanding that we are all equal. This is on top of achieving high academic outcomes and successful career paths. That place doesn’t have to be imagined: it is here – in an integrated school. It is certainly true that all schools provide the NI curriculum and will provide broadly the same extra-curricular activities, but an integrated school will give this and more. Only in an integrated school will children see what is familiar from their background but also learn what is unfamiliar to them, but “the norm” for others in the class. It’s a fact that this is the only place in the world where parents set up their own schools. They did so because of a passionate belief that, after years of conflict, we could only help to solve the communal ides in this society by bringing people together. In September,  Lagan College opened its doors.  years on can we say we are truly the mixed society they wanted us to be  We have, I would suggest, still some road to travel! But the journey is worth the effort. And as Principal of Oakgrove Integrated College, I can say we are committed to making our contribution. Within our school, there is real excitement amongst staff and pupils about learning, and excitement about learning from and with each other. Integrated education brings people together as children, and keeps people together for le.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Mohamad Ali, who runs the Maiden Heaven cafe in Waterloo Place, said his shops logo bears a “a striking resemblance” to the Parachute Regiment’s. On Bloody Sunday, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were responsible for killing  innocent civilians in the city, another man died from his injuries months later. googletag.cmd.push Since then the Parachute Regiment and its flag has proven to be a contentious issue in the city. Flags can seen displayed in loyalist ares of the city in support of Solider F, who had been charged with the murder of Bloody Sunday victims William McKinney and James Wray. At an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when theymarched through the city wearing the insignia with the letter F underneath. The flag has also been burned on bonfires in nationalist ares of the city. Mr Ali said he would never have used the logo, featuring an ice cream cone and wings, had he realised the similarity between it and the insignia the regiment. The shops barriers at its outdoor seated area also features the similar maroon colouring to berets worn by Parachute Regiment soldiers and flags featuring its insignia of an open parachute with wings. In a post on Facebook, owner Mr Ali, apologised for the logo and said that he’s “working to change it”. He said: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.     “Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would NEVER have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years. I am working now to change this. And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and color, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner.

Donna McLenaghan, who lives in Smiths Falls, Ontario, is hoping to find out more about the family of her great great grandparents who left County Derry for Perth, Canada in the s. googletag.cmd.push Charles McLenaghan and his we Annboth lived in the Dungiven area prior to emigrating.  “My ancestors were originally from Derry, Ireland. They lived around Dungiven before emigrating to Canada,” explained Donna. “The family name is McLenaghan and my great great grandmother who married into the family was an Osbourne and the Osbournes owned an estate called Altmover.” Donna says, according to parish records, the McLenaghans lived in a tract known as Boveva on lands they leased from a family named Carey. They lived there for many generations, which is proved by a lease from Captain Arthur Carey, dated , to Robert McLenaghan of Ballycargan, of the whole townland of Ballycargan Manor of Pellipan for  years. Records also show that many of the McLenaghan clan were schoolmasters and generally were people of superior education. The Osbourne family, whom were also prominent in the district, were originally English, coming from Leeds.  Their estate in County Derry was called Altmover and they were squires and landlords of the neighbourhood. Altmover remained in their possession until the twentieth century, the estate being broken up in .     Ann Osbourne, who was a daughter of the family and heiress to the estate, married Charles McLenaghan. They went on to have a son, named Nathaniel, who married a woman called Jane Morris from County Wexford.  The family then emigrated to Canada. Donna says another of her ancestors, Mary McLenaghanalso emigrated to Canada with their five sons. One of her sons was called Robert Meighan, who married the sister of George Stephen, the first president of Canadian Pacic Railway. She says Robert worked with his brother-in-law to negotiate rail lines between Perth, Ontario and Toronto.  He was also involved in other business and went on to buy a renaissance mansion from his brother-in-law which was called George Stephen House, also referred to as Mount Stephen Club. It has been used by ious Hollywood stars for shooting period films. Donna is now keen to piece together her family tree and hopes to reconnect with others in the area who may have connections to her ancestors. “I decided to trace my family roots out of a very keen desire to find out more about my family roots and possibly connect with relatives that may still be living in the area. “Im also very interested in my great great grandmother Ann Osbournes family as theres mention of it being the same name as the Dukes of Leeds and I wondershe was related to them.” Donna says she hopes to travel to Ireland soon and intends to make a visit to County Derry to visit the area where her ancestors were born. “I havent visited the area although I was hoping to while on a trip to England in  and have had the desire to for many years and hope to do so in the very near future. I feel such a closeness to Ireland as well as the UK since this is the region that my ancestors are from.”  Consultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride  Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon has announced the move.

The window when the sporting acumen of the local community was dissected with a fine tooth comb. The reserves took the field at two oclock in front of one man and a dog. And by the time the game headed for the final furlong, cars would be trickling in the lane for the senior game. Elbows on the wire, the elder statesmen of the club would surmise who the best reserve players were. googletag.cmd.push “Yer man would need to take a look at Johnny,” one might offer. “Hes lording it out there.” There would be a nod back. Sport is all about opinion. With more people filing into the ground, the noise level will go up. Enter the club time-bomb. We all know them. The sort who would argue a black cat white. The man from the opposing club, who was acting as linesman, would have his line ball decision questioned. And all of a sudden chests would be pumped out and a mouthful of choice words exchanged. Often, it sets the tone for the senior game. But the double header gives reserve players an identity. Some will stay togged out for the seniors. Others will get the disco shoes and the hair gel slapped on for the few scoops down the pub later. Some will huff and puff that the senior manager doesnt rate them. A few weeks back, I was in Owenbeg for Newbridges win over Coleraine. Being early, I mixed typing up a few match reports with watching the reserve game. Alan Nash let it flow from end to end, with the senior managers looking on before taking their squad away to prepare for the main event.     There was just that united feel to it all. A group of players who trained on Tuesday and Thursday night, went to the gym together, slagged each other in the same Whats App group during the week, they were all on an even keel. Give or take a man or two, Newbridge have a senior reserve  of  training most nights. Coleraines  sits around the  or  bracket. Its the most theyve had in ages offers Ryan McGeough, their affable two-time championship winning goalkeeper who has now stepped into the role as club Chairman. Mathematically, double headers are not a problem here. But it makes for a juggling act. Newbridge manager Killian Conlan offers the conundrum of how many players to hold off reserve duty. Most clubs are the same. Who am I Iikely to use in the senior game  And its not an exact science. It brings me back to the days of watching Sunday double headers. Being taken off in the reserve game was an elevation in status. “I told ye....Johnnymust be in the senior managers plans,” offers the club stalwart. This is the problem with being the fringe player. Youre caught between two stools. Half a game here, five or ten minutes there. Formation changes, injuries, black cards and poor performance all need to be thought through. The players caught in the middle can miss out on action. The four Newbridge senior subswere held off reserve duty, including Mickey ONeill who came on with minutes to go in a game that was decided while he was on the pitch. His chasing back helped force a turnover on the way to the Bridges winning point In a scenario like Newbridge, moving up the pecking order in the Derry club scene is their mantra. Men caught in the middle just have to ride it out and push like mad for a senior place. Odhran McGlones brief was to put Sean Leo McGoldrick on the back foot, which he did with four points in an all-action  minute performance before his fuel light began to flash and PJ ONeill came in to keep them ticking towards the finish line. The Bridge were the only team guaranteed to finish top of their group before a ball was kicked at the weekend. Would they have got over the line against Coleraine without fresh legs  Thats debatable. The previous night, Sean Cassidy came on in the th minute of Slaughtneils defeat to Lavey. Having played in the reserve game, he was back in action again and fisted over a point within minutes of coming on. Every clubs circumstances are dferent. There are dual clubs, there are suspensions and there is Covid. Its all rosyyou have the numbers. Sideline View conducted a mini poll of club senior  sizes, not counting short-term injuries or any Covid- related unavailability. With the exception of Claudys  of , the other  Division A clubs have a senior  capable to fielding senior and reserve teams on the same day. Of the  responses,  squads had  players or more to fuel a senior and reserve team. A further three were in the middle bracket –  to . At junior and the lower end of intermediate level, the story is totally dferent. The remaining  clubs, were under the  number required to field two teams in one day, without needing to coax a few retired players back to fill out the team to ensure everybody gets football. Concessions dominate the results pages. Of the  intermediate reserve championship group games fixed, only four were played. Four. It has been really sore on clubs who have the numbers. On top of their senior squad of , Steelstown have a reserve  of . With the need to grow GAA in the city, not having a reserve championship game leaves it very dficult to maintain player retention. Why stay when other sports can offer more. Castledawson, Faughanvale, Glenullin and Drumsurn are other intermediate teams who didnt get their full compliment of games. Intermediate champions Greenlough had a recent in-house  versus  game, with nine substitutes. Their reserves have had a in one game in almost nine weeks. In many cases, clubs cannot field a senior and reserve team on the same night. Midweek reserve fixtures at . leave it impossible for some to get home from work on time, taking the numbers even lower again. The reserve and senior double headers of old at the weekend give the best chance toto the status quo. As this column has alluded to in the past, Saturday evening would be a better option. But it doesnt suit everyone. With a fluid situation, there needs to be a look at the future of reserve football and where it fits. Clubs should only enter a teamthey can fulfil their games and allow the CCC to restructure. For example, Desertmartin seniors are playing in the junior ranks, yet have a squad of  and traditionally were always very successful at intermediate reserve championship level. Clubs could be asked for their input into how everything could fit together. Senior managers, with input from their club committees, should look into – and be accommodated by the CCC – moving their reserve game to a dferent night, possibly a training night. One of the management team could take charge of the reserves and everyone  trains. When Ronan Rocks was in charge of Desertmartin, he phoned ahead every week to request a Friday reserve fixture. It was almost always accepted. Stephen Barker, the CCC Chairman at the time, was only too glad to accommodate it and inform the referee of the revised fixture. It takes a bit of give and take between clubs, but overall it would be a step in the right direction. Andone club fails to agree a move, then the fixture remains as it is. The days of two and half three on a Sunday have gone forever in certain quarters. The next step is to make sure the level of conceded reserve games disappears until everyone is playing on a regular basis. That has to be the goal, for the long-term future of clubs.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Earlier this year, Clanmil had successfully appealed the decision by Derry City  Strabane District Council not to grant them permission to build on the Victoria Street site. googletag.cmd.push That green-light to Clanmil came to the dismay of Into The West who saw the prospect of the dry rail line on the site being dug up to make way for the planned new flats thereby putting a spanner in the works of the rail lobby groups hopes of having passenger trains run from Derry to the south and west of Ireland. Steven Bradley met with the Councils Governance  Strategic Planning Committee to discuss rail expansion from Derry. Cllr Sean Mooneyraised the following point to him. He said: “There seems to a pressing matter that could prevent any progress on this is the one of Clanmil and the possible development on the Victoria Road.” He proceeded to ask Mr Bradley: “In your view,that goes ahead and is built, is that game over for any future prospects of a rail review. Because when you look at the map, Derry is the end of the rail line when it comes in from Belfast. How  would you address a rail line going from Derry to Donegal or Strabane ”     Mr Bradley replied: “Personally speaking, I suspect it will . “If you start with the principle of a single, central station for the city – the Waterside – andyou accept that you cant cross north of the river over the Craigavon Bridge, because the space and angles arent there, the only way youre going to get rail south to Tyrone and then west to Donegal, is to pass through the Clanmil site. “So the other options involve putting s over the River Foyle, Bearing in mind that rail is heavy, youll be getting into big engineering solutions that are very costly. The economic viability of doing this will be blown out of the water. “Thats why I cant see it being viableClanmil build their structure. “Weve met with Clanmil and had discussions with the DfI . “Everything is in Clanmils court. The have planning permission to build that structure. They could start work on it tomorrow and nothing could be done to strip them unless the will is there to compulsory purchase it – which isnt there from the DfI and I suspect is not there from the Council either. “What were trying to do is to negotiate a solution whereby one of two alternatives happen. Either Clanmil can re-design their building and leave a strip clear between that building and the river so that rail in the future could run along there. “The second alternative were pushing for is for Clanmil to find an alternative site that they could transfer their ambitions onto and wed be very keen for the Council to assist them in that. “Otherwise I cannot see how youre going to get rail going south from Waterside towards Tyrone, Fermanagh and Donegal without going through that Clanmil site.” Clonmil Housing have been approached for comment. Earlier in the meeting, Mr Bradley outlined the inequalities of the current rail network in Northern Ireland by illustrating how everything appears to be geared in favour towards rail stations east of the River Bann.  How the rail network west and south from Derry might look in the future  He said: “We have fty-four railway stations in Northern Ireland of which only three are west of the River Bann. Belfast in greatly rich in rail provision compared to what we have here. “An all-Ireland map of the rail network never fails to shock. Its like someone took a pair of scissors and cut out the railways of a very important corner of the island – the North West. We are lobbying to see that situation changed. “Theres a very clear east-west disparity in terms of rail provisions. We have a six to fix list and so far only one of those has been fixed – the option to buy a ticket online from Derry that will get you to a station in Dublin without having to buy two separate tickets and having to pay extra for that. “It used to be that every station east of Coleraine could do that but we in Derry couldnt. That was fixed in Spring of last year so were grateful for that. “However, were still in the situation whereby Northern Irelands second biggest city – Derry – has only one train that gets people to Belfast before nine am in the morning. “Whether it be for studying or working, there is only one train – leaving at twelve minutes past six in the morning – that will get you in on time. “Coleraine on the other hand, has four trains that get you to Belfast before nine am. Even Portrush, a seaside villagehas two services that do that – one more than Derry. “When you look at peak hours, between four and six pm, theres a half-hourly service that runs from Belfast all the way to Coleraine and then stops there. We in Derry only have hourly services compared to all stations east of Coleraine. “Another fix is the Saturday night service. If you want to go to a concert or an evening out in Belfast, you have to leave before nine o clock at night because the last train that will get you back to Derry on a Saturday evening leaves at ten past nine. “Which means you will have to leave your dinner table or get out of the gig around half past eight in order to catch the train on time. “However,you lived in Coleraine, your last train back from Belfast leaves at twenty to eleven which is plenty of time to fully enjoy at night out in Belfast. “Sundays are a particular bug-bear. There are only six trains on a Sunday between Derry and Belfast – thats one every two hours. If you miss one, youre snookered and have to wait two hours for the next train. “Whereas every other station from Coleraine and eastwards, has a train going to Belfast every hour and has thirteen services in total. “Theres no rationale to have a dferent quality of service on a Sunday because people still need to go and visit people, still need to go to university in Coleraine, Derry or Belfast and people need to catch flights – all things that are done on a Sunday. “Even with the network we currently have, Derry is very much the second-class relation in terms of rail provision.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Fred chose Chupacandra Wizard Bull, bred by Helena Mudrova, as the top female Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Derry canine judge, Fred Jones flew out to the Czech Republic last week to cast his expert eye in selecting who would be the Worlds top dog. Fred, , who is also a self-employed joiner, has been part of the dog show scene for close to two decades, both in the capacity of showing dogs at competitions as well as judging them. googletag.cmd.push The breed he specialises in are Staffordshire Bull Terriers which he passes judgement over using strict Kennel Club criteria. Last week he was at the World Dog Show in Brno, Czech Republic, where he had to pick a winner from  entrants in the female Staffordshire Bull Terrier category. The one he picked was a Stafford named, Chupacandra Wizard Bull, who is owned by Czech breeder, Helena Mudrova. Fred enjoys his role as a dog judge but said its a long process before you can get to cover World shows as he does. He said: “You become a dog judge through your peers. Basically, you start off showing dogs and eventually, after a few years, somebody will invite you to judge at lower level competitions. “Once you do that, theres Kennel Club exams, seminars and certain criteria you have to meet. Its a progressive thing as it takes many years to work your way up to becoming a championship show judge. “From showing to judging my first ever low-level competition took me about four years. That was in . “In , I judged my first Irish championship. Ive travelled a bit now and Ive been to thirteen countries to judge. The World Show was a very prestigious one to get.     “All dogs are judged on their breed standard as laid down by the Kennel Club which all those showing the dogs have to adhere to. Thats basically covers everything about the dog. “I judged the female Staffordshire Bulls in the World show in Brno which had a total of ninety-nine entrants. “You had dferent classes as well such as Intermediate, Junior class, Open class and winners get a ticket towards an International Beauty title show – of which a dog needs three.” Fred knows what is required for a dog to win a competition having showed dogs himself at the highest level.  Fred Jones with his legendary champion dog, Lackyle Diabhal Og in  He added: “I have showed dogs myself in both Ireland and the UK extensively. There was a dog, named Lackyle Diabhal Og, that I owned that became UK, Irish and International champion. “Hes sadly no longer with us. He was a very famous dog – he produced more champions than any other Stafford in the history of breeding in Ireland. He was also top Terrier stud dog in the UK in . “Two years ago, I showed the grandson of that dog, named Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, which somebody in Scotland owns and he became a champion. He won a Reserve CCat Crufts. “I bought my first Staffordshire bull terrier as a school boy in . I joined my local Staffordshire bull terrier club in  I first became secretary of the club in  held many positions since then including secretary for the second time for the last ten years. “My first judging appointment was in  my first overseas appointment was the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of Queensland Australia in . “I have now judged my breed on twenty eight occasions in twelve countries, nineteen of these were breed club appointed shows and I also awarded CACIBin Italy in .”  Fred with Lackyles grandson, Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, who was one of the winners at Crufts in  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Fred chose Chupacandra Wizard Bull, bred by Helena Mudrova, as the top female Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Derry canine judge, Fred Jones flew out to the Czech Republic last week to cast his expert eye in selecting who would be the Worlds top dog. Fred, , who is also a self-employed joiner, has been part of the dog show scene for close to two decades, both in the capacity of showing dogs at competitions as well as judging them. googletag.cmd.push The breed he specialises in are Staffordshire Bull Terriers which he passes judgement over using strict Kennel Club criteria. Last week he was at the World Dog Show in Brno, Czech Republic, where he had to pick a winner from  entrants in the female Staffordshire Bull Terrier category. The one he picked was a Stafford named, Chupacandra Wizard Bull, who is owned by Czech breeder, Helena Mudrova. Fred enjoys his role as a dog judge but said its a long process before you can get to cover World shows as he does. He said: “You become a dog judge through your peers. Basically, you start off showing dogs and eventually, after a few years, somebody will invite you to judge at lower level competitions. “Once you do that, theres Kennel Club exams, seminars and certain criteria you have to meet. Its a progressive thing as it takes many years to work your way up to becoming a championship show judge. “From showing to judging my first ever low-level competition took me about four years. That was in . “In , I judged my first Irish championship. Ive travelled a bit now and Ive been to thirteen countries to judge. The World Show was a very prestigious one to get.     “All dogs are judged on their breed standard as laid down by the Kennel Club which all those showing the dogs have to adhere to. Thats basically covers everything about the dog. “I judged the female Staffordshire Bulls in the World show in Brno which had a total of ninety-nine entrants. “You had dferent classes as well such as Intermediate, Junior class, Open class and winners get a ticket towards an International Beauty title show – of which a dog needs three.” Fred knows what is required for a dog to win a competition having showed dogs himself at the highest level.  Fred Jones with his legendary champion dog, Lackyle Diabhal Og in  He added: “I have showed dogs myself in both Ireland and the UK extensively. There was a dog, named Lackyle Diabhal Og, that I owned that became UK, Irish and International champion. “Hes sadly no longer with us. He was a very famous dog – he produced more champions than any other Stafford in the history of breeding in Ireland. He was also top Terrier stud dog in the UK in . “Two years ago, I showed the grandson of that dog, named Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, which somebody in Scotland owns and he became a champion. He won a Reserve CCat Crufts. “I bought my first Staffordshire bull terrier as a school boy in . I joined my local Staffordshire bull terrier club in  I first became secretary of the club in  held many positions since then including secretary for the second time for the last ten years. “My first judging appointment was in  my first overseas appointment was the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of Queensland Australia in . “I have now judged my breed on twenty eight occasions in twelve countries, nineteen of these were breed club appointed shows and I also awarded CACIBin Italy in .”  Fred with Lackyles grandson, Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, who was one of the winners at Crufts in  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

The cross-border cycle path and walkway looked to have been halted in its tracks back in June when planning permission for the first phase of the project had been rejected.

She said “This greenway route is part of the North West Greenway Network Scheme which collectively will deliver .km of shared pedestrian and cycle paths on a cross border basis. “We need to reduce our reliance on petrol and diesel vehicles and for people to be able to make the choice to use more sustainable forms of transport. Infrastructure like this needs to be in place. “This application should be viewed alongside a similar application that is being worked on by Donegal Council that will eventually bring the greenway from St Columbs College right through to Buncrana.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Councillors on Causeway Coast and Glens Leisure and Development Committee approved a date and location for the International Air Show event to be held in . googletag.cmd.push The event is set to take place on the weekend of September  and , with the flight path to be centred between the towns of Portstewart and Portrush. However, Sinn Feacutein raised concerns over an absence of budget projections on a report presented to the Committee, and during an ill-tempered spat among councillors, proposed a further report be brought. Cllr Leanne Peacock Ballymoney Sinn Feacutein councillor Leanne Peacock said the council had shown a dereliction of duty. “Weve got to this stage, agreeing specic details of this project, but were yet to have a single estimate provided to this council for what it will cost us,” she told the council. “As custodians of the public purse, its a complete dereliction of our duty to proceed without a single estimate of what this will cost our rate payers. “We have seen where such reckless decision-making has got us in the past. This council has spent thousands on consultancy fees a year before the event. “Its outrageous that members are not being provided with the most basic detail to make decisions the cost, which is usually the starting point.”     Cllr Peacock proposed a report be brought back to the Leisure and Development Committee with costings included, along with details of affordability checks carried out on the proposal. Council Mayor Richard Holmes pointed out a report with costings was already due to come back to the Committee, before opening the floor to speakers. Council officer Richard Baker said the event was still in the early stages of planning. “What weve done is set the foundation of the event the date and the location.

Mr Colhoun, who lives at Somme Park near Altnagelvin, scooped the prize – awarded by Clanmil Housing Group – for his and the rest of his six-strong gardening teams work on the housing schemes garden. The annual Clanmil in Bloom competition highlights the hard work that goes into making the gardens at Clanmil housing schemes look pristine. googletag.cmd.push It recognises people who take a keen interest in keeping the green spaces around their homes looking the very best they can and gives green-fingered tenants a chance to showcase their handiwork. Mr Colhoun, a tenant at Somme Park, was presented with his award by Paul Fiddaman, Chair of Clanmil Housing, at a special celebration at The Clayton Hotel in Belfast. John is one of a team of six keen gardeners who tend the Somme Park site. He described accepting the award on their behalf as “a great privilege.” He said: “We love watching Monty Don on Gardener’s World and the Cha Flower Show to get tips and ideas – like planting strips of wildflowers instead of having all grass. Our fuchsia is doing very well this year.” As well as growing flowers at Somme Park, the gardeners have also created raised beds where they grow vegetables and have created pathways to make them wheelchair accessible for other tenants. John added: “We have peas, potatoes, gooseberries, red currants, courgettes and peppers.” “We even had a vine growing, but the wee birds and robins ate all the grapes.” John, who used to be a beekeeper, has always had an interest in gardening. He described how important getting out into the garden was to him during the lockdown.     He continued: “I find gardening very therapeutic, and it is a social thing too. The lockdown was a real hard time, and it was important to get to know your neighbours and check in with them to seethey were OK. “At Somme Park everyone looks out for each other, and we all have a bit of craic now in the common room.” Claire Darby, Senior Engagement Officer said, People who live in Clanmil homes love spending time in their gardens and many people across our schemes have spent a lot of time during lockdown in their outside spaces. “The Clanmil in Bloom awards event allows us to celebrate all their achievements and to recognise the great work they have done towards creating that special outdoor place.” Clare McCarty, Group Chief Executive at Clanmil, added: “Credit is due to all the participants, the judges and to Greentown Environmental – our grounds maintenance contractors – who helped sponsor the competition. “The pride and passion that Clanmil people have for their homes and neighbourhoods is clear to see. “Congratulations to everyone who took part, and especially to all the winners.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Mr Colhoun, who lives at Somme Park near Altnagelvin, scooped the prize – awarded by Clanmil Housing Group – for his and the rest of his six-strong gardening teams work on the housing schemes garden. The annual Clanmil in Bloom competition highlights the hard work that goes into making the gardens at Clanmil housing schemes look pristine. googletag.cmd.push It recognises people who take a keen interest in keeping the green spaces around their homes looking the very best they can and gives green-fingered tenants a chance to showcase their handiwork. Mr Colhoun, a tenant at Somme Park, was presented with his award by Paul Fiddaman, Chair of Clanmil Housing, at a special celebration at The Clayton Hotel in Belfast. John is one of a team of six keen gardeners who tend the Somme Park site. He described accepting the award on their behalf as “a great privilege.” He said: “We love watching Monty Don on Gardener’s World and the Cha Flower Show to get tips and ideas – like planting strips of wildflowers instead of having all grass. Our fuchsia is doing very well this year.” As well as growing flowers at Somme Park, the gardeners have also created raised beds where they grow vegetables and have created pathways to make them wheelchair accessible for other tenants. John added: “We have peas, potatoes, gooseberries, red currants, courgettes and peppers.” “We even had a vine growing, but the wee birds and robins ate all the grapes.” John, who used to be a beekeeper, has always had an interest in gardening. He described how important getting out into the garden was to him during the lockdown.     He continued: “I find gardening very therapeutic, and it is a social thing too. The lockdown was a real hard time, and it was important to get to know your neighbours and check in with them to seethey were OK. “At Somme Park everyone looks out for each other, and we all have a bit of craic now in the common room.” Claire Darby, Senior Engagement Officer said, People who live in Clanmil homes love spending time in their gardens and many people across our schemes have spent a lot of time during lockdown in their outside spaces. “The Clanmil in Bloom awards event allows us to celebrate all their achievements and to recognise the great work they have done towards creating that special outdoor place.” Clare McCarty, Group Chief Executive at Clanmil, added: “Credit is due to all the participants, the judges and to Greentown Environmental – our grounds maintenance contractors – who helped sponsor the competition. “The pride and passion that Clanmil people have for their homes and neighbourhoods is clear to see. “Congratulations to everyone who took part, and especially to all the winners.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

When asked for a reason for his stance, Robinson said: “I wouldn’t force people to do it, it’s your choice and your body.” googletag.cmd.push Ireland manager Stephen Kenny has defended his decision to pick the striker to play in Saturdays game saying it would be extremely radical to punish players with international exclusion for refusing to be vaccinated. I think for inidual associations to just come together to decide not to select any player that hasn’t got it would create as many problems,” added Kenny. “They’re problems we don’t need to have.” Joe Duffy opened the conversation on his show Liveline today which seemed to snowball into an argument between pro and anti vaxxers, with some callers slamming Joe for bullying the  year old Robinson. Shocking stuff from @joeliveline beretating Callum Robinson for not taking a covid vaccine. The HSE clearly state the longterm effects information are limited. No one should be hounded in to taking any medication-especially a still on trial one! #liveline — Karen Luby October ,     While others felt that Robinson shouldnt be allowed to play in Saturdays game. If you are not vaccinated you shouldn’t be playing for Ireland, unless you have proper medical reasons. #liveline — Cllr Declan Meenagh ️♿ #StayHomeSaveLives October ,     Commenters on Twitter were also quick to point out that since Callum Robinson has had Covid twice, he would surely have stronger immunity towards the virus. Joe is a dummy .. imagine covering this topic and not knowing that the player is recovered from covid and has more protection now than somebody vaccinated . Luke O Neill should be interviewed on the show to shut up those who don’t follow the science of natural immunity #Liveline          — samryan October ,     The FAI has since released the following statement: The Football Association of Ireland can confirm that all players and staff are tested for COVID- before reporting for international duty with Republic of Ireland teams and are tested repeatedly in camp in line with FAI and UEFA protocols. We have encouraged all our players at all levels of the game to be vaccinated but we respect and must accept the right of all iniduals to make a personal choice on COVID- vaccination. The Association will continue to exercise the highest standards for the safety of all our stakeholders. Our COVID- testing protocols for all players and staff on international duty strictly follow UEFA protocolsand are compliant with all Irish Government guidelines. The FAI reconfirms our support for all Government, UEFA and FIFA protocols during the COVID- pandemic. We thank all our stakeholders for their ongoing exemplary compliance with Government guidelines over the last  months.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArgumentative County Derry man broke Covid regulations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  FeaturesCanadian woman hoping to trace familys roots in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

A source close to the country star has said It becomes a big story for Garthhe gets the five nights at Croke Park he was denied before. Three nights won’t be enough. googletag.cmd.push He wants his full five shows at leasthe is ever toto Ireland. Hundreds of residents in the Croke Park area met beside the venue last week with stadium management and Aiken Promotions with concerns over the amount of concerts being planned. Residents are outraged that there could be seven potential concerts held next year and it could go to the High Court, but Dublin City Council could still refuse as they did back in . As it stands under restrictions, only three gigs can take place in Croke Park in a calendar year between January and February. As there has not been a live show in Croke Park since July , Aiken Promotions have been hoping that this would allow them room to negotiate for more gigs in . Garth Brooks May Move Gigs To Aviva If  Croker Nights Falls Through - https:t.co JfNXSWs pic qjsWujjA — Radio Nova  October ,     Pending this decision, insiders say that Brooks is willing to move some of his shows to the Aviva Stadium,hes request for five nights at Croker is denied. “But Garth could do three nights in Croke Park then another three concerts in the Aviva Stadium”,the source continued.     “He could do what Ed Sheeran did in  and add in even more concerts around the regions. This is also causing issues as Sheeran himself has booked two concerts in April . Research has shown that each Brooks gig could possibly generate €million to the local economy. Another study also showed that one concert ticket sold for a Brooks concert would provide € spent in the local area. “They remained steadfast before, and there’s no reason to think they’ll cave in to Garth this time”. “DCC are more into bicycles than heavy lorries so it doesn’t take much imagination to get their view on a fleet of heavy artics rolling in and out of Croke Park for an unprecedented numbers of concerts, added the source. The country singeris already pencilled in to perform in Croke Park for September ,  and  in .Applications have already been lodged to get two extra dates added to this.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district. It is time these areas saw the delivery of much needed housing, the councillor insisted.ldquoAs a Sinn Feacutein representative, the delivery of new, affordable,and social homes for those in need is one of my priorities.ldquoHousing is one of the most fundamental human needs. It provides basic shelter, comfort and security. A home also affords personal dignity, a space for privacy and a foundation for family le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Best wishes to Knockevin staff  ","story":"SLIEVE Croob councillors Cathy Mason and Roiacutesiacuten Howell paid a recent visit to the new Knockevin senior school in Castlewellan.Located on the site of the former Castlewellan Primary School in the town, the councillors welcomed staff and students and hope that they will be very happy and will be warmly welcomed by the wider community.Cllr Howell said the global pandemic had ldquosignicantly disrupted the education of the special school pupils and impacted on their learning, communication and mental health.She extended best wishes to school principal Sarah Liddell and senior department leader Gillian Rea.ldquoWhilst the children have been on the premises from September, there are still issues that I and Cllr Mason will be working closely with the school, the Education Authority and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ensure that staff and pupils have the best all round experience on their newly refurbished site, added Cllr Howell.Cllr Mason said Knockevin caters for pupils with severe and profound learning dficulties aged between  and  and aims to provide a supportive educational environment where they feel secure, at their ease and thrive both educationally, socially and spiritually.She said the main school is located in Downpatrick, with an Early Years Centre in Dundrum.ldquoNow we have the senior school in Castlewellan which will seek to help pupils achieve their maximum level of independence in preparation for le when their education finishes, said Cllr Mason.She added: ldquoHaving visited the Downpatrick site in recent months I have seen first hand how happy and content the children are in school..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_bid.jpg","title":"Bid to save St Mary’s school from closure  ","story":"GOVERNORS and staff have pledged to try and save a primary school in Saintfield from closure.St Maryrsquos Primary School is earmarked to close by August  next year due to low pupil numbers.The Education Authority last week published the closure proposal seeking any objections or support to be lodged by November .The proposal was made by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the schoolrsquos trustees.It states enrolment to the  year-old school on the Old Grand Jury Road has dwindled to  pupils for this academic year, with the majority in the Primary  and  classes.The proposal claims there is currently only one pupil in the schoolrsquos Primary ,  and  classes, two pupils in Primary  and no pupils in Primary .A spokesperson for CCMS said: ldquoCCMS has carried out initial consultation on the closure of St Maryrsquos Primary School in Saintfield, which is a Down and Connor diocesan school. Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms. These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges. CCMS believes that the proposal to discontinue provision at St Maryrsquos PS would not impact signicantly on other schools.It lists other Catholic primary schools in the area mdash St Caolanrsquos in Darragh Cross, St Josephrsquos in Crossgar, and St Patrickrsquos in Ballynahinch mdash as being between less than four to seven miles away from St Maryrsquos and which could take its pupils.The proposal also said closure plans had been put back for a year due to the Covid- pandemic.The SDLP councillor for the area, Cllr Terry Andrews, said he shared the concerns of parents and staff.ldquoSt Maryrsquos has provided first-class education to the community for many, many years and the staff are to be commended for their dedication to generations of families who have sent their children there, he said.ldquoI would encourage all local people to take part in the consultation to the EA and make them aware of their strong feelings to the proposal..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Business owners urged to engage over town future  ","story":"THE Downpatrick business community has been urged to play a full part in the consultation exercise on the continued economic regeneration of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is spearheading the initiative and local councillor Dermot Curran appealing to businesses to get involved.While a number of politicians are in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, local authority officials are not keen. However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address. Revitalising the town centre is crucial.Cllr Curran mdash who is in favour of appointing a town centre manager mdash believes that Downpatrick should also have a vibrant body to represent tradersrsquo interests, one that could play a key role in helping attract investment and new business to the area.He said as one of the provincersquos county towns, it is disappointing that traders do not have a dedicated body to not only represent them, but articulate their views.ldquoAs we move out of lockdown and look forward to a post-Covid world, businesses will have an increasingly important role to play, suggested Cllr Curran.ldquoPutting the needs of the business community front and centre is essential and attracting additional footfall has the potential to benefit a signicant number of traders. Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others. I hope that this vision can be realised..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_conor.jpg","title":"Conor shines in final  ","story":"DROMARA travelled to Ballykinlar to take on a fancied Drumaness side in the county U- Football Shield final last Sunday evening.The game started well for Drumaness with two quick points on the board from Niall Flanagan and Ben Cassidy in the first few minutes, but soon Dromara were awarded a penalty after Thomas McKey was fouled in the box.Thomas took the penalty himself, but it was well saved by lsquokeeper Reece Rogan.Dromara did get on the scoresheet after a foul on Odhraacuten McCann was converted by Jon Rodgers.Both defences dictated play over the next period with Dromararsquos Elliot Harris, Sam Warwick and James Furphy keeping the mobile Drumaness forwards at bay.Dromararsquos fortunes took a hit when forward Odhraacuten McCann suffered a nasty shoulder injury and had to be replaced.Just before the water-break, Drumaness rattled off two excellent long range scores from Conor Armstrong with Dromara replying with an equally great score from Joe McAllister.Dromara were finding the physicality of the Drumaness full back line of Leo Madine, Ben Miskelly and Philip Gladysz dficult to penetrate.Drumaness finished the quarter with a point from Conor Murphy leaving them ahead by three points.The second quarter started off with another cracking point from Conor Armstrong and within minutes Drumaness took control of the game.Shea Quinn got on the end of a long ball and bagged a goal and a minute later Conor Armstrong hit a second goal.Dromara rallied with good points from Thomas McKey and Jon Rodgers but once again Drumaness replied with a point from a free from Conor Murphy and two further points from the unstoppable Conor Armstrong.Drumaness half backs Jaiden Murdock and Conn OrsquoHagan were delivering quality balls to their forwards and Dromararsquos half backs Aidan OrsquoHare and Ryan Gates had to work very hard to stem the relentless attacks.Young Lorcan McNeill scored a great inidual goal to offer Dromara some hope, but, as ever, the Blues hit straight back with scores from Jake Madine and another from Conor Armstrong.The half ended with a fine point for Dromara from the energetic Joe McAllister to leave Drumaness leading by nine points. Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final.

I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage. His mother is vice-principal at St Patrickrsquos.Cormac hopes to major in Government and graduate in , but has taken the opportunity to get involved in other activities such as being admitted to the John F Kennedy Junior Forum.Cormac was one of  people accepted out of  applications.ldquoItrsquos really competitive to get into to so I threw my hat into the ring not expecting to get it so I was completely blown away when I did. he said.ldquoThe group organises heads of states, politicians and leaders in business to visit campus where we moderate discussions and debates with them and a student audience.ldquoWhile Irsquom on the digital marketing team helping to promote the events, I could also find myself on stage later this year with Nancy Pelosi, the serving Speaker of the House of Representatives, which is completely mind-blowing.Cormac has suggested inviting Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission mdash a sign of his continuing interest in all things European.He met President Joe Biden when he was  after an opportunistic letter to him turned out to be beneficial.ldquoI was a massive Biden fan long before he ran for President and Irsquom still very proud that I predicted his presidency four years ago. I wrote a letter at  and saidI would like to meet himhe was ever in Ireland. My parents and I got the chance to meet him in Dublin the day after the Brexit vote.ldquoIrsquom more likely to ask him nowhersquos going over to Ireland, would he give me a lt on Air Force One, he joked.Cormac is still not behind the door connecting with famous people with his red hair helping him engage with TV host and producer mdash and fellow redhead mdash Conan OrsquoBrien when the former Hard student gave an address to new students.ldquoThe rest of the guys suggested we get a picture together as we look alike but he was great fun. The best thing was that I was wearing my Red High GAA shirt, said Cormac.While he has taken Hard and the US to his heart, Cormac retains his real love for his home.ldquoIrsquove really loved the adventure of having to adapt to the American culture and my three best friends here are all Americans.

The alternative is to face the unfortunate consequences of their actions which I donrsquot think is something anyone would want to see.Cllr Trainor said ongoing anti-social behaviour has not only impacted on the coronavirus testing centre, but work to provide a new walking track around the perimeter of the town centre park.ldquoThe recent spate of anti-social behaviour threatens to damage the positive work which has been accomplished in the area over recent times and this must not be allowed to happen.ldquoThis has been such a dficult year for everyone and we continue to emerge from Covid, more resilient and ready to see more delivered in our local communities for the better. Part of this includes the new walking path.Cllr Trainor said the work to provide the new path is ongoing with people already taking an interest in it.He added: ldquoI appeal to those responsible for a series of incidents at Dunleath Park to stop what they are doing and realise the consequences of their actions. The testing centre in particular is a key asset in the ongoing fight against coronavirus.ldquoThe excellent frontline staff who work there deserve to be allowed to get on with the job free from threats of any kind.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table. He had entered London Marathon for spring in a bid to cut his previous time of . set there in . Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances. She had to pull out in the middle of the Lecale Ultra last month due to injury but she sensibly rested enough to get back on her feet and Kevin carried on his mission with his usual understated approach.Come race day they ran well literally taking it in their stride. They finished in the same time of . which is a personal best for Clare by three minutes and four minutes for Kevin. A job well done.Jim Erskine has done a few marathons in his time, having completed his first way back in , but this time he entered at the request of his daughter, Ellen, who was making her debut.The duo followed the training schedule together keeping each other motivated in the long runs. They lined up knowing that Ellen would have the upper hand in both youth and speed but she was glad that her dad was there to keep her pacing on track. His experience paid off in spades.When they parted company at  miles, Ellen had enough reserves to finish strongly and Jim knew that he would complete at his own pace. Ellen posted a time of . ndash commendable to break four hours on her first attempt.Jim finished in . just as delighted with Ellenrsquos performance as his own.Marathons are not always about going as quickly as you can. For some, simply getting to the end is a great result as it proves that you have the determination to achieve your goal.Sam Anderson has come on literally leaps and bounds in her running. She has been a keen attender at training and while she would admit that she is not a leader in terms of pace, she is a great inspiration to others.She went under the radar and took on the Great Manchester Run recently. She didnrsquot spread the word as this was all part of her plan to do the marathon without making a drama out of her intentions.While this was not her first time doing a full marathon, it was in her words ldquothe first in a long time.She took to the roads with the masses and then set her own rhythm. She had to dig deep as the miles went on and was very grateful to meet up with a friend who then encouraged her for the latter half.Her time was immaterial mdash crossing the line, and knowing that she had done what she set out to do, was her sweet reward. A big congratulations to her for this.Not every runner on Sunday in Belfast was out to do the full route. A popular addition to the marathon is the relay event.Rachel Madine, Martin Willcox, Mark OrsquoConnor with the addition of Wayne and Daniel Giles made up a team with each of them doing a section of ying .Patrick Smith was involved in a team raising money for the Anthony Nolan Trust. They all enjoyed being part of the bigger picture and I suspect some of them might be thinking that a full marathon could be on the cards in the future. It is an addictive pastime.Janine Murray had won an entry into London Marathon at the EDAC draw in December . When her name was pulled out of the hat, she was concerned as to whether she would be ready in time. Little did she know how long she would have to train.She did complete two virtual marathons close to home but finally  months later she arrived in London for the live event.London has all the glamour and the pizzazz with , runners strung along the spectator lined course.The iconic landmarks that form the back are a sight to behold and those who have ran this marathon see it as a bucket list event.Janine had been training hard and set off with the goal of breaking four hours  minutes but also to enjoy the atmosphere to the full.She was buzzing with excitement at the finish from the run alone but when she saw her time of ., she was over the moon. She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions. He was very content with his finish timeand also delighted that he was able to complete his th marathon in such spectacular surroundings.We as a club are based in Downpatrick but we have some members who live in other parts of the world and we love to keep in touch with them.Hannah Somanitook part in London. She ran an impeccably paced race with splits barely wavering beyond a couple of seconds per mile.This metronomic performance earned her a . finish, well within her . aim and placed th out of the female finishers. Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds. He hopes that this will be something that he repeats next year.Wendy Findlay set off to the remote location of Loch Ness for her marathon. She loved the pipers and the Baxterrsquos soup at the finish but the monster hill at mile  wasnrsquot so welcome.She described the route as undulating but scenic and the weather, as you would expect in Autumn in the highlands, as fresh but damp.The marshals were friendly, reaching the start was easy and all in all she had a great day out. She finished in . after reaching half way in . setting a negative split in her enthusiasm to reach the finish.She mentioned that her husband Johntook part in the Festival of Running laid on for the supporters and said that this would be another reason to recommend the event to anyone considering an entry in the future.With all the talk of mileage, we mustnrsquot forget that challenges come in many dferent forms.Neil McCartan is highly unlikely to do a marathon as for him speed is king. He sticks to the track with m his preferred event with races up to K the norm. After leading out the EDAC team at the Road Relay Champs in style, he ed to Victoria Park in Belfast for the weekly parkrun.These events are not races but timed runs open to anyone who registers. Neil was taking part as a training exercise in his group coached by Mark Kirk.He lead the pack in with a super slick . for the k which was reported later as being the third quickest parkrun time recorded at any of the weekend parkruns throughout the UK.We donrsquot normally report on parkrun as it is impossible to keep on top of all the activity, but this one is worth a mention. Well done for putting EDAC on the map.We are always open to new senior members and have acquired quite a few recently who are glad that they have taken the plunge.We are an all rounder club with members chasing speed, distance and the challenges but we also have a main body who come to training to keep fit and enjoy the good company.If you are interested, please email Donal at membership@eastdownac for details..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie.jpg","title":"Francie builds boat with recycled material  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK man is realising his dream of building a river boat by using recycled materials such as wood pallets and aluminium.Instead of costing around pound, for a new boat of the same size and specication, Francie Morgan aims to finish his ft boat on a budget of pound,.The  year-old intends to launch the four-berth boat from Carrybridge in Upper Lough Erne in Co Fermanagh next May, with the help and support of his family and many friends.But before that, he would love to enter it as a float in next yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick.While the main structure is complete, Francie will be working over the winter and spring to fit out the inside.The father-of-seven began to build the boat last year during lockdown and scoured scrape-yards and recycled materials yards to get items which either cost him a fraction of their original price or where the owners were only too happy to get rid of them.ldquoTherersquos men who are only too happy to see me coming to take away some pallets. It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

mdash A major new drive has been launched to attract private investment in a planned multi-million pound facelt for Newcastle.Down Council is targeting a host of major private firms in a bid to interest them in investing in a major redevelopment of the entire seafront of the town, from the Slieve Donard to Newcastle harbour.A new brochure detailing the councilrsquos plans for the town has been produced and is being circulated to a large number of firms, other funding sources and statutory agencies.Blueprints for the improvement scheme, which has received support from both the council and the Newcastle  group, were revealed last year.The plan consists of three stages mdash from the Downs Road car park to Castle Bridge, between the Newcastle Centre and Pattons Bridge and the third section which involves creating a new promenade to the harbour.The document outlines plans to regenerate Newcastle and make it a top tourist destination.DOWNPATRICK mdash The development of a new multi-screen cinema in Downpatrick would provide the perfect kick-start to a major economic regeneration initiative in the town, it has been claimed.Downpatrick councillor, Peter Craig, who has been one of the driving forces behind the push for a new cinema made his comments three weeks after plans to develop a new cinema at Dunleath Park were abandoned by Down Council.The local authority admitted the ambitious proposal earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre had fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, it hopes the multi-million pound complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Firefighters tackled a blaze at a farmyard on the outskirts of Castlewellan last week.The blaze, at Wood Road, was discovered at around .am last Friday when a passing postman alerted the farmer that one of his barns was on fire.Two crews of firemen from Newcastle and a third from Rathfriland were called to the scene and fought the fire in the barn, which contained  round bales of straw.A second adjoining shed, which had  tonnes of silage stored in it, also went on fire and although the first barn was destroyed, the structure of the second was saved.Station officer Nevin Donaghy explained that although no animals or humans were hurt, their efforts at fighting the fire were hampered as the nearest hydrant was over one mile away from the farmyard.CROSSGAR mdash No toys, few clothes and little food ndash local schoolchildren yesterday discovered first hand what le is like in a community with nothing.From a world that is void of any luxuries and running short on basic necessities, African visitors from Malawi, brought their gt of song to St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar.Nine representatives from a primary school, a hospital and a church of the Embangweni Station sang Malawian songs and shared stories about their home with the pupils.With the aim of the visit to share cultures the visitors were offered Irish stew and watched the pupils perform Irish dancing.The school children were amazed to hear how their guests had never been on a plane, boat or train before and how they only earn around pound a year.School principal, Mr Harry Murray, said he was delighted to have the visitors at the school so his students could hear for themselves just how dficult le is for people across the world.DRUMANESS mdash Local politicians have this week been accused of portraying a negative image of the district and hampering future inward investment.The damning claim has been made by Rowallane councillor Eddie Rea, who secured a seat on the local authority just over three months ago.Mr Rea believes recent comments by some politicians about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative image of the area.He claimed both councillors asked for a decision to approve expansion work at the plant to be deferred on ldquohearsay evidence and suggested they never checked what he described as the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a petition containing , signatures in support of the controversial development at the Gocean.The plan to develop a -acre site, including a new marina, has split public opinion in the town, but local community worker Billy Walker said he believes an increasing number of people are now backing what is one of the biggest ever private investment schemes in the district.In March, planning officials confirmed a public inquiry would not be ordered into the project being spearheaded by Ravenblack Developments, which is also proposing to provide a new cafe, craft and chandlery shop and a mill house.It is understood local planners, who are currently examining the detail of the plan, could make their decision before the end of the year.The developers say they are confident the scheme will signicantly raise the profile of Killyleagh as a tourist destination and add support to existing town facilities such as shops, entertainment, recreational facilities, schools and churches.SAINTFIELD mdash Dozens of brides arrived at Second Saintfield Presbyterian Church Hall on Thursday evening for a girlsrsquo night out.There was a distinct absence of grooms as women and girls filled the hall for a wedding dress fashion show to raise money for the cancer research.Tables were decorated and guests were seated, as  models went backstage to get ready for a show.As the brides made their way along the catwalk, wedding tales recalling generations of local brides emerged.The compere told the story of one local woman who had left her husband waiting at the altar for half-an-hour because her cat was having kittens, while other young women, modelling their mothersrsquo and grandmothersrsquo dresses, told their own family tales.DERRYBOYE mdash Managing a successful PR consultancy and travelling to the far side of the world to adopt her ldquolittle angel, has helped to make a Derryboye womanrsquos le complete.Rosemary Hamilton seems to thrive off her busy lestyle and the fact she and her husband, Terry Graham, adopted a baby girl from China three years ago.Rosemary, who is the co-founder and now chairman of Holywood-based Future Image PR consultancy firm, and her husband were one of the first families from Northern Ireland to adopt a child from China.As Rosemary explained, she has had a long love affair with China and its people, ever since she heard a woman recite the Lordrsquos Prayer in Chinese when she was at Sunday School.Her fondness of the country continued into her adult years, she travelled quite a bit throughout China and Asia, and when she and Terry married they automatically thought of adopting a child from the country..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_mands.jpg","title":"M%26S hotly tipped to open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

A number of children have to cross the road on their way to school and it is essential that it is safe to do so, he continued.ldquoA pelican crossing can help achieve that and I hope that the roads minister will look favourably upon my request. This is a critically important issue that must be addressed.Cllr Curran said it is his understanding that the recent incident involving a child at the Downpatrick Road ldquocould have been quite serious and hopes that action will be taken to prevent any kind of repeat.He said pupils who attend the busy primary range in age from  to  and in addition to his request to Mrs Mallon, he would be keen to meet meet with roads officials on site.ldquoIt is a very serious situation when drivers are not obeying the speed limit, declared Cllr Curran.ldquoA new pelican crossing would require drivers to come to a complete stop to allow children to cross safely..Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe recent incident involving a child has reinforced the need for a dedicated road crossing and I hope that the Department for Infrastructure will respond positively to my request.

Supporters of both clubs were robbed of the pulsating midfield clash witnessed in the league meetings between these sides of Brea McKee versus Aimee Greene.St Johnrsquos star McKee has been instrumental for the Black and Whites this year, but Emily Stewart and Cara McEvoy still ensured a fine tussle in the middle sector against Greene and Lauren McGivern.The St Kevinrsquos full back line of Casement, Noade and Ferris had to be alert to the quick passes being drilled towards Aoe Stewart, Catherine McKey and Dervla McNeill.Maria Gilchristrsquosmeant that once turn-overs were made, play could be swtly transitioned directly into Rhona Gordon, Laura Carville and Kate Fitzsimons.Goalkeeper Orlagh Rice was impressive for the away side. The former Poacutec Fhaacuteda runner up, has the strongest re-starts in Division , and she launched numerous attacks, drilling accurately into the paths of Catherine McKay, Leanne Kelly and Claire Marie McCann.Her one delivery that went astray, was collected by Gordon in the th minute, who superbly struck over the bar from the tightest of angles.Jenny Greene had a good battle throughout with Cara Doyle, as did young Anna McVarnock with Niamh McEvoy.McVarnock played a superb crossfield ball into the path of Ryan, just before half time, who finished emphatically to the net, giving the Kevinrsquos a healthy eleven point lead at the break with a half time score of - to -.The second half provided further evidence of the intelligent structured game that Kevinrsquos are increasingly playing.Better combination and link-up play, especially between defence and attack, is leading to improved performance levels. The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13082707.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There can also be pus and some may have the condition for weeks or even months.What are chilblains and how does this dfer from Covid toes Chilblains are small, itchy, red patches that can appear after you have been in the cold.Chilblains usually appear a few hours after you have been in the cold and you mostly get them on your fingers and toes, but can also get them on your face and legs.They usually clear up on their own in two to three weeks, but you may need to see a GPthey do not go away.What causes Covid toes A new study - published in the British Journal of Dermatology - has found that Covid toes could be a side effect of the immune systemrsquos response to coronavirusResearchers behind the study examined  participants with Covid toes and  with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic.The study found that one mechanism behind both types of the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies, which mistakenly target and react with a personrsquos own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus.     Researchers also found an overlap with type I interferon, which is a key protein in the antiviral response.Cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains.Senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition.He said: ldquoThe epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved.ldquoOur study provides new insights. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “Adam has proven himself as an outstanding local representative since being elected to Fermanagh and Omagh District Council. He’s shown real passion to improve the lives of people in his local community and across the council area. “As a science teacher he understands the reform that’s needed in our education system. He also recognises the dire need for immediate action to tackle the climate crisis to safeguard this place for future generations. “Adam is part of an ambitious SDLP team in Fermanagh and South Tyrone delivering for local people. People want to see action to address waiting lists for housing and healthcare, but they won’t get it from the status quo. We need people to choose change and vote for candidates like Adam Gannon to build a better future for everyone across the North. Mr Gannon said: “It has been a real honour to represent my local community as a councillor over the past few years and I’m delighted to have been endorsed by the SDLP as our candidate for Fermanagh and South Tyrone in the Assembly election. Since being elected I have worked to help people on a wide range of issues, both big and small, and would love the opportunity to bring the voice of local people into the Assembly chamber. “I’ve lived in this area all my le and am proud to call it home. Unfortunately, local people have been badly let down by their politicians in recent years. We have seen businesses close, the decimation of our town centres and the abandonment of our rural communities. We deserve so much better than this. “The SDLP has a strategy to transform the North and I want to be part of it. The politics of ision may suit the DUP and Sinn Feacutein but it has delivered nothing for people here. We need real action to ensure that everyone can get the medical treatment they need without having to wait years for it, that everyone has a home that meets their needs, a radical overhaul of our crumbling education system and a real commitment to tackling the climate crisis.
