The idea is simple. First press seven iconic tracks onto 7” vinyl, each limited to 100 copies. Then ask for open submissions from artists to design one-off sleeves, before putting the 700 one-off disc sleeves on display for art aficionados and music fans to ogle, before a public sale. The project is run by Kevin King and Jordan Stokes, who run experiential agency Goodness together.Contributors in previous years include Peter Blake, Yoko Ono and the Chapman Brothers, but the bidder only finds out whether their sleeve is by a world-renowned artist or a talented newcomer once they’ve made the purchase. That’s the secret part. Some are easier to guess than others. A watercolour by Antony Gormley for Massive Attack’s Karmacoma in 2014 echoed the artist’s sculptures, whilst David Shrigley’s scratchy portrait of The Cure’s Robert Smith for the first edition couldn’t have been the work of anyone else.This year’s music selection s 54 years of Columbia Records’ back catalogue, from Aretha Franklin’s One Step Ahead to 2018 singles by The Internet and Koffee.

Ending on the seventh year, feels wonderfully apt.” Augusta PownallThe final Secret 7” exhibition and sale is held 4 - 13 September 2020In their mid-century heyday, John and Sylvia Reid were one of Britain’s most prolific design partnerships. Like their post-war peers, the couple, who met as architecture students in 1941, believed good design should be accessible to all. During the 50s and 60s, their futuristic lighting and pared-back furniture brought a gleam of modernity to semis and bedsits across the country. The low-key Reids never courted publicity and now their work is largely unknown. But their eldest son, Dominic, an architect, has set out to restore his parents’ reputation by reissuing some of their key pieces of furniture. The ‘S’ range, originally produced by UK manufacturer Stag between 1959-1960, epitomises their knack for understatement: modular sideboards with a discrete flash of inlay a bench floats on V-shaped legs. The new range is made by Nick Radford, whose parents originally owned Stag, and last year the new S230 chair was awarded a Design Guild Mark.Through their work for the Festival of Britain the Reids met and mingled with design luminaries such as Arne Jacobsen, Charles and Ray Eames and Lucienne and Robin Day. Unlike their more vocal contemporaries, says Dominic, “there was a puritanical streak to Dad. He felt that talking about design was bluster. In his mind, design was about coming up with real solutions to problems. Because they never wrote about their work I felt it was important to tell the story of how they fitted in to the landscape of mid-century design.”Their output was huge: cookware and office furniture, pubs, university common rooms and restaurants. They did everything “right down to the carpets or door handles”. In those heady years, awards – from the Council of Industrial Design or judges at the Milan Triennale – were frequent. Innovation lighting was another Reidian speciality. Their Atlas kitchen light, designed in 1958, was the first domestic fitting that could be used without a transformer. Six million were sold. Original Reid lighting is now sought after, which has inspired Dominic to consider re-issuing some of their rarer designs. The challenge, he says, will be to replicate the quality at an affordable price. “One day I’d like to see John and Sylvia Reid back on the high street, where they belong.” Serena FokschanerGiorgio Armani’s knack for furnishing a space gave him his start in the fashion world. After university and military service, Armani worked as a window dresser at the upmarket La Rinascente department store in Milan in 1957 before becoming a menswear designer and eventually launching his label in 1975. Though he is now the most successful Italian designer in history, the love of furniture persisted, and ArmaniCasa homeware celebrates its 20th anniversary this year.“I wanted to create a complete Armani lifestyle which reflected my ideas and which could be applied to various areas of daily life and not just fashion,” he says. Over the years, ArmaniCasa has expanded to an international interior design company which can supply everything from your teaspoons to your bed. But Mr Armani still loves the first homeware piece he ever created: the Logo Lamp. “It was my first design, created in 1982. It bears witness to this interest of mine, this striving.”2020 has been an unusual year for everyone due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and Giorgio Armani was the first designer in Milan Fashion Week to hold his show behind closed doors as lockdown started across Italy in February. All of his Italian factories made medical overalls during the pandemic. The designer counts the community spirit forged by the fight against the coronavirus as a great achievement. “I successfully and independently led a company that gradually expanded into sectors beyond fashion to offer my all-embracing philosophy of lifestyle,” he says. “I can say this is an enormous achievement. But it’s the public support and feedback at the early and most dramatic stages of the current crisis that fill me with pride, as they demonstrate a solid relationship built over time.”Though anniversaries are typically a time to look back, the designer’s continuing pleasure in the achievements of ArmaniCasa is clear: “Today, ArmaniCasa turns 20, but for me it’s still the wonderful opportunity it was at the beginning in 2000, when I launched my first collection. It’s a stimulating space for creativity.” Alice Fisher“What does this smell remind you of?” asks Tasha Marks. The food historian and artist is discussing her latest olfactory artwork – a perforated bronze sculpture with a scented core, a collaboration with the sculptor Robert Erskine. First: a waft of Play-Doh. Then, top notes of freshly washed babygrows. Am I right? Almost, says Marks. The smell is, in fact, breast milk.This piece was commissioned by the Wellcome Collection in London. “My challenge was to make a pleasing human smell that celebrated the microbiology of the body.” After consulting academics at the Wellcome, she hit on breast milk. It took two years of olfactory research to refine the aroma, which was made by a fragrance house.Marks uses smell to tell stories. To evoke food writer Elizabeth David’s friendship with interior designer Anthony Denney, she used ceramics scented with orange and bay leaf, which enveloped visitors, to an exhibition at the National Trust’s Rainham Hall in London. For an event at the Fashion Space Gallery, she made a Last Supper from chocolate to spark debate about the ephemerality of art. When Kensington Palace put on a show about Queen Victoria and colonialism, Marks infused busts of the monarch with tobacco, tea and curry. “The smell is the tip of the iceberg the rest is research,” she says.Marks studied art history at the University of Sussex. When she wrote her dissertation on jelly, it drew her to the world of food and scent. “Food and fragrance go hand in hand. If you’re attuned to taste, you’re attuned to smell,” says Marks, who also trained as a chocolatier while setting up her business AVM Curiosities in 2011.Now that galleries are looking at different ways to entice visitors, she thinks that scent events will become increasingly popular. “As more of our lives are lived in the digital sphere, we crave live experiences. I’m not a fan of audience participation, but I like the idea of an immersive experience, which you can do collectively with others. It’s opening up a new way to enjoy art.” SFLong-time housebound, we’re all looking for small pleasures. These new ‘Symbols’ handles fit the bill. Prolific young designer Adam Nathanial Furman has designed this collection of small geometric handles for fledgling British firm Swarf, which specialises in handcrafted hardware for the home. Mutual Instagram followers, Swarf co-founder Kate Worthington contacted Furman after he expressed a desire to collaborate with emerging brands. ‘We’ve been fans of his work for a while and felt we shared a similar sense of playfulness,’ she says, ‘So we asked Adam to design a modular series of handles, to fit with the approach we’ve used in other ranges.’ The resulting seven shapes can be used horizontally or vertically – mixed and matched into various handle compositions and shades. ‘Symbols is a little celebration of ersity in the home,’ says Furman, ‘like a set of beautifully crafted geometric emojis.’ Bethan RyderSymbols is available in satin or polished brass, four power-coated RAL colours from £30 each, bespoke colours also possibleIssey Miyake has always insisted that his work is design not fashion. Throughout his career – he’s now 82 – he’s embraced craft, technology and more recently recycling. He’s worked with paper, innovative fabrics and reused bottle tops to create clothing that is unisex and sculptural. While other designers started trends or made It bags, Miyake is known as the uniform of choice for creatives. Steve Jobs’ black turtleneck was Miyake. The designer has such a close relationship to ceramicist Lucie Rie that she left him her button collection when she died. Zaha Hadid was a fan of his oeuvre: one of her favourites was a padded kimono jacket that she preferred to wear upside down. She also liked to carry a Bao Bao bag.The Bao Bao is the school bag of the creative industries. First and foremost, it is an amazing piece of engineering. Created from a mesh fabric layered with small triangles of polyvinyl, as it’s filled with items and then meets the body it’s transformed into a myriad of shapes. The first iteration of the bag was introduced in 2000, Miyake named it the Bilbao as a homage to the Guggenheim Museum that had opened there in 1997. That building – by Frank Gehry – became an instant architectural icon. It seemed to explode from the ground in the same way that Miyake’s clothing often appeared to take shape once put on to a human body.The Bao Bao Issey Miyake bag was then launched in 2010 as a separate line, and has gone through many tweaks, in size and form and colour, but in its 20 years, has never been swept up by the It bag hype. Not quite expensive enough (the average Bao Bao is around £300-£400) and too clever by half, though a thing of beauty it’s more brain than arm candy. The V\u0026ampA’s exhibition “Bags: Inside Out” (opening September) will feature a Bao Bao Lucent Metallic Tote.The miniature Hello Bao Bao bag collection is available from Selfridges in AugustGrowing up in Soweto, Johannesburg, 23-year-old Lindelani Nedoboni remembers entire afternoons playing classic games such as Street Fighter and Pac-Man on “big old black arcade boxes” at local spaza shops. A spaza or tuck shop is an informal store that used to be found on every corner in townships, selling everyday essentials at cheap prices. They were also community meeting places.But with the commercialisation of Soweto, spaza shops are no longer social spaces, and the arcade machines no longer have a home.“This project is about reviving that whole culture and nostalgia,” says Nedoboni, who founded Masidlale Gaming to bring the township game experience to young people.Last year, Masidlale collaborated with the Fak’ugesi African Digital Innovation festival to create the Arcade Box project, creating spaces inspired by the design of houses in Soweto to act as portable arcades and showcase games by local designers. “The design was about representing the space we are from,” says Nedoboni.The boxes are flatpack and lightweight so they can tour. Tegan Bristow, the director of Fak’ugesi, says they flew an Arcade Box to a festival in Maputo, Mozambique. “Next we want to see the box going into rural areas in South Africa,” she says.The local gaming industry is independent and lacks investment. So, as well as exposing communities to locally designed games, Arcade Box also wants to generate discussion about African gaming.“As an artist it really helps to tell your own story,” says 22-year-old game designer and animator Thabo Plingo Tsolo, whose game Taxi Wheels is hosted on Arcade Box. Like Nedoboni, Tsolo grew up playing video games in Soweto. He noticed the games he played as a kid bore no relation to his culture. “I saw this gap as an opportunity,” he adds.Taxi Wheels is a 2D platformer game set in Bara, a well-known minibus taxi rank in Soweto. Minibus taxis are “basically the backbone of South Africa’s economy,” adds the designer, who says the game is for “whoever wants to play a local game with a local story, a local environment and a local aesthetic”.Tsolo hopes to tap into the wider sub-Saharan African market in the future. “There are more than a billion people in Africa but no one representing us, no one telling our stories. We’re the only people who can do that.” Alice McCoolSocial distancing isn’t going anywhere for the foreseeable and, according to research from the Bartlett School of Architecture at UCL at least two thirds of London’s pavements – so let’s assume much of the UK – aren’t wide enough to enable us to observe the two-metre rule. Applied, a global wayfinding agency, has recently worked on a new pedestrian-led city plan for Seattle and redesigned Toronto’s transit system. Now the agency is looking at how wayfinding can offer manageable solutions for navigating the next stages of lockdown.Applied founder Tim Fendley, who recently created (pro-bono) a new system in Bath that enables NHS workers unfamiliar with the city to travel to the Royal United Hospital, more easily, is examining how this might work on a national scale.“Because everything has changed, we can change how cities work overnight,” he says. “From part-time working to giving more road space to walkers, people are adapting to this new normal quickly. For example, Vilnius has closed streets to cars to make way for outdoor cafés in Berlin, temporary cycle lanes have been painted on roads to encourage cycling.”Fendley’s studio has also looked into social distancing on public transport. “There are simple ways we can help people feel confident about moving around in public again,” he says. “Using clear signage to encourage people to wear masks, and indicate when and where this is most important. Educating people on what two metres feels like.”He suggests using coloured face masks to identify the most vulnerable and green wrist tags for the service industry, so that hairdressers and waiters can clearly identify they have been recently tested. “The realistic view is that inoculation and herd immunity is between 12 and 18 months away. We have to choreograph a dance between the virus and the economy.” Becky SunshineFor most of us, the first stop on a city tour might be a museum. For industrial designers Liang-Jung Chen and Shuei-Yuan Yang, it is the local hardware store. The designers, based in London and the Netherlands respectively, find that the items on these shelves tell them more about the culture, climate and habits of a place than a gallery show.The pair come from rural South Taiwan, and the make-do spirit of people in their hometowns has inspired their work. When they went to Taipei to study, they started poking around local stores . “In the countryside they use hardware the wrong way, but in a creative one,” says Chen. “We thought we could learn from that.” So they set about creating new purposes for items on sale, with the addition of a few basic materials and a sense of humour.The resulting project is The Misused, which the pair describe as “a geeky study in how to use metal hardware wrong”. Then they moved to Europe, and found local hardware equally baffling – and great inspiration for a second collection. So, a nailplate punched through a cork base becomes a candlestick, a flagpole holder set inside a simple acrylic box becomes a vase, and bird spikes set in a concrete base are reinvented as a Brutalist dish rack.Their designs are pleasingly minimalistand inventive and wouldn’t look out of place in a high-end concept store. The anonymity, though, is part of the appeal. “You have designer chairs, but you don’t have designer hardware,” Chen points out. They will soon open their own web store, allowing those of us without the knack of seeing a jewel box in a butt hinge to get in on the action. APDesigner Anthony Dickens has worked with many big brands over the years – Anglepoise, Audi, Unilever – but now he wants to focus on fixing life’s small annoyances. His LittleSolves homeware line aims to make the everyday better. The first product exemplifies this idea nicely. The Quiet Glass is a tumbler in a colourful silcone sleeve. This tough base deadens the sound as the glass hits a table, improves grip and protects the vessel from smashing if you drop it. “We want our products to add a little enhancement to someone’s day, every time they use them,” says Dickens. We’ll drink to that.

Branches of Primark and Sports Direct were among those attracting large numbers of customers before they opened.In Liverpool, the queue for Primark stretched around the shop and along a street behind, before the retailer opened its doors at 7.20am.The retailer does not have an online shop and had lost £650m a month in sales while shops were closed across Europe.Mia Melia, 20, told PA Media that she had arrived at the Liverpool branch just after 8am. “I needed pyjamas and all sorts really,” she said.“I have done some shopping online during lockdown but when things arrive they don’t always fit. It did feel a bit weird in there because it has been months since anyone has been in.”Shoppers heading for the high street will have to get used to new rules before and after they enter stores.The queues were partly explained by retailers placing restrictions on the number of people who can be inside at any one time. Stock has been spread out to allow physical distancing and some items can no longer be handled by browsers.John Lewis, which on Monday opened only two stores, is using disposable covers for customers who want to test furniture and asking people to wear disposable socks before they try on shoes.It said the top sellers at its Kingston branch had included buttons, designer face masks, egg cups and china sets, while in Poole shoppers snapped up towels, sofas, bedding, TVs and printer cartridges.Apple, which opened stores in London and Northern Ireland, is taking customers’ temperatures and supplying them with face masks before they enter.In Sunderland, the Northern Echo reported a mile-long queue outside Sports Direct and there were similar scenes at some of the retailer’s other branches.A queue of people also waited outside Nike Town on Oxford Street in London, two hours before the store’s opening at 11am.Ricky Young, who was there to buy trainers, said it felt like a return to some kind of normality. He said he had not expected it to be busy when he arrived.“I actually thought people might have been sleeping or didn’t want to go out,” he said. “But the doors are open again, it’s back to almost normal, back to business – but we just have to line up.”Springboard said the weather had “undoubtedly helped high streets”, as shoppers were content to queue outside when it was warm and sunny.“Footfall is likely to increase further by early afternoon as people come out later in the day and during their lunch hours.” The government has urged people to get out and spend money to prop up an economy damaged by three months of lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0048ed6ff784b916aee8faec2909e4dc35d0233/0_0_4641_3094/master/4641.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641e43b9a6670e2fa1472c984063b41d 700w","title":"british economy cash rishi sunak","story":"Rishi Sunak needs to think radically by introducing a universal basic income until this crisis passesMy local high street has refitted itself for today’s reopening of non-essential shops, enabling customers to stay 2 metres apart. Businesses have spent thousands in a frantic attempt to stave off imminent bankruptcy. Yet within a week that money may have to be spent again, as Boris Johnson teases that he may change the distancing rule from 2 metres to 1 metre.This is toy-town government. Nowhere else in Europe seems to be behaving in this way. The image is of toffs in secure jobs playing maths with other people’s lives.Shopkeepers are victims not of any disease but of a panicked political response to disease, to deprive them of trade. Plenty of other countries, among them Japan, Sweden and South Korea, did not close their retail sectors. With scientists refusing to take sides on the 2-metre rule, the block seems to lie with ministers who so inflated people’s fear they now dare not return to normality.Everything must be done to restore earning and spending. This week a further £150bn is expected to be added to the £645bn of the Treasury’s quantitative easing. But this is money going mostly in the form of debt into the banking system, including schemes to help businesses through the crisis. The official estimate is that direct government spending will rise by £337bn, but of this only half will go straight into people’s pockets through the furlough scheme.Nine million people – a quarter of all employees – may be getting paid not to work by the government, but this will tail off in August, leading unemployment to soar, possibly past a staggering three million. With large chunks of the economy still in lockdown, as the chancellor himself has admitted, this will be suicidal. To the OECD, it will be the worst outcome of any western economy.Rishi Sunak must think radically. There is no point in saddling iniduals, companies or future generations with soaring debt. The British economy needs customers, not debtors. It needs cash. So-called “printing money” is what governments have done in emergencies throughout history. They are doing it now. Germany is distributing €300 cash to every child and €6,000 rebates for buying low-carbon cars. The US is proposing to hand out $1,200 to (most) adult citizens. China, Australia, Japan and France have all gone down the handout route. This is the quickest of economic blood transfusions. Above all, it does not have to wait on banks. It is recovery led from the ground up, from the market place.Who pays for this money? No one, unless government defines it as “borrowed” from itself. Of course cash handouts can, under reckless regimes, veer into rampant inflation and disaster. Britain is not reckless, and inflation is close to zero. But with a soaring unemployment rate and capacity lying idle, the one thing the economy needs is the cash of which its government, if with the best of intentions, starved it three months ago.Sunak should slash VAT and extend his direct payments to all who need it for the remainder of the year. The government owes all Britons a universal basic income until this crisis passes. As for the cost, it should be written off. Let the bankers howl."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ea6178ec48ae9413685ee5cc1aac108a950007c/0_120_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4af432c98a959a5eac93e7ee5d824cfb","title":"2m children in uk have done almost no school work in lockdown","story":"Private school pupils five times as likely to get near-full-time teaching during crisis, study findsPrivate school pupils are five times more likely to get near-full-time teaching online during lockdown as those at state schools, according to research that suggests far less school work is being done at home than previously thought.Prof Francis Green, the lead author of the study, said its findings painted a gloomy picture of lost schooling and low amounts of schoolwork at home.He said: “The closure of schools, and their only-partial reopening, constitute a potential threat to the educational development of a generation of children.“Everyone is losing out in this generation, some much more than others. Better home schoolwork provision, and better still an early safe return to school for as many as possible, should now become a top priority for government.”The findings, published by the LLAKES Centre for Research on Learning and Life Chances, are based on data collected in the last two weeks of April from a survey covering more than 4,500 children aged five and upwards from households across the UK.“The private schools’ spending per pupil – at least three times those of state schools – enable them to gain better academic grades in normal times,” said Green. “Their resources and parental pressure have ensured that many more private schools have delivered a proper home schooling alternative.”The findings came as secondary school pupils who are due to sit exams next summer began to return to class for some face-to-face time ahead of the summer holiday.

In December 2018, a natural landslide had caused large chunks of rock to fall from the steep canyon walls that hem in the northern sections of British Columbia’s Fraser River.The crashing boulders – 75,000 cubic metres of rock – created an impassable barrier. But because of the remote location, the damage wasn’t discovered until the following June: just as millions of wild Pacific salmon were beginning to spawn up the river.“When I saw it, I realised what we were up against,” said Sterritt. “The magnitude was just … awe-inspiring. And not in a good way.”The fallout from the rock slide could not have come at a worse time. Wild Pacific salmon populations had already suffered steep and seemingly irreversible declines over the years biologists openly muse about a future without the fish.Government work crews, aided by local First Nations, sprang into action, deploying nets, trucks, drones and dynamite in a frantic effort to help the salmon pass through the barrier.Working through the dry summer heat at the site of the slide, known as Big Bar, as many as 100 people laboured from early morning until dusk, clearing debris and rescuing stranded – and incredibly weak – fish. Helicopters were brought in to airlift as many over the waterfall as possible.Chinook, the hardiest type of salmon, made it through the frothy falls first, taking shelter in eddies to regain their strength before hurling their bodies into and over rocks. As crews cleared more space in the river, sockeye and pink salmon began clearing the barriers. In all, nearly 250,000 salmon successfully traversed the landslide area – with another 30,000 flown in by helicopter – a long way off the millions that normally make the journey.Almost a year later, as the salmon return once more for their annual spawn, significant debris remains in the river.“We knew from the start that this is a very difficult place to work and there’s a massive amount of material that has landed in this river,” Fisheries and Oceans Canada project leader Gwil Roberts said recently.There are glimmers of hope in the protracted rescue mission: a pneumatic tube – called a Whooshh Passage Portal and nicknamed the “salmon cannon” – will soon be installed along the canyon walls to help move fish over the debris. A concrete fish ladder, constructed from hundreds of cement blocks, will also make the journey easier. And a convoy of trucks will be on standby to shuttle the fish over the barrier if things do not go as planned.In some ways, the sustained effort by workers to save the fish, drawing on all possible resources, is dwarfed by the journey many salmon undergo at the end of their lives.As their biological clock kicks in, salmon begin an exhausting journey from the Pacific coast to the rivers and streams of their birth – sometimes travelling more than 1,000km (600 miles). They are guided by magnetic fields and their keen sense of smell.For a brief period, even the smallest streams are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of fish, transforming the tranquil bodies of water into a flurry of life.“They’re splashing around, they’re chasing each other. It feels like the river is just pulsing with life,” said the Vancouver-based salmon researcher Vanessa Minke-Martin. “It’s a really magical thing to see.”But the journey has a devastating impact on their bodies. From the moment they first enter fresh water, they stop eating and their bodies begin to decay and weaken. If they make it to a calm location in a stream, they reproduce and await their inevitable death within days.Even reaching the site of the Big Bar landslide is a miracle: the fish need to travel more than 200 miles from the mouth of the Fraser River, running against the current the whole way. Some continue for another 400 miles to reach the streams where they were born.Because of their unique life – born in fresh water, migrating to the ocean and living for years in the salty waters, only to return home to reproduce and die where they hatched  – salmon have a deep integration with nearly everything they interact with. First Nations have long understood the importance of that interaction. Indigenous communities that thrived nearly always did so because of their proximity to coveted salmon rivers.“We used to hear stories of people walking across the river on the backs of fish there were so many,” said Sterritt, of the legendary bounty, harvested and smoked for the winter or traded with other communities.Bears and wolves prowling the banks of rivers feast on the flesh of spawning fish, discarding the carcasses for eagles to scavenge. “Even trees in the forest take nutrients from the decomposing carcasses,” said Minke-Martin, a reference to a study that found trees growing on the banks laden with nitrogen-rich salmon remains grow much larger than on streams with no salmon.With ecosystems relying heavily on the presence of salmon each year, the collapse of populations has been devastating. Southern resident killer whales off the coast of British Columbia – which rely on an abundance of chinook – are teetering towards extinction. Last summer, emaciated grizzlies wandered aimlessly, searching for migrating salmon that were nowhere to be found. The starving bears only survived because of the generosity of local First Nations, who deposited hundreds of salmon on the banks of the inlet.It was clear by winter that the mission to rescue the salmon in Fraser had not gone to plan. Many were in poor health from the prolonged fight against the falls, government biologists said, calling into question their ability to finish the long journey home.Near Prince George, only a single female chinook returned. “She swam back and forth and eventually died all by herself,” Dustin Snyder of the Spruce City Wildlife Association, told CBC news in December.A number of streams in the area had no salmon return – and for those that did, the numbers were small. “They were battering themselves and getting stressed,” said Roberts. “This year we have the plan in place to move the salmon to ensure they can get across the slide site and we are very hopeful we will have very, very low mortality.”The fish ladder and salmon cannon have brought much-needed hope to the operation this year. The terraced concrete ladder is being constructed to allow salmon to travel through channels of water that are flowing slower than the river – enabling them to bypass obstacles. Ladders are already a common sight at dams, which prevent salmon from naturally completing their spawning runs.“Fish will sense the existence of flowing water coming down the ladder, move up the ladder, come around into a holding pen,” said Roberts. They will then be guided into the Whooshh Passage Portal – a series of six 150-metre pneumatic tubes running alongside the cliff face.The fish will move 19 metres per second for 20 seconds. The Seattle-based company that produces the device, Whooshh Innovations, says the transported salmon will then be gently deposited back into the water, past the boulders in the river.On the advice of the Yinka Dene Alliance, a coalition of six First Nations affected by the slide, the government has also bought itself time in the event none of the strategies work: a handful of eggs from the most vulnerable salmon runs – early stuart chinook – were sent to a hatchery, which Roberts says gives officials the opportunity of reviving the population if needed.But significant rock debris remains in the river and costs paid to a private company tasked with removing boulders have continued to balloon, from an estimated US $12.3m (£9.7m) to nearly $38m.While it initially appeared to be an isolated incident in a remote pocket of the province, the landslide has instead forced a reckoning about the trajectory of vulnerable salmon, raising the troubling prospect that the rescue mission – and any other efforts – might have been too little, too late.“Losing wild salmon is going to affect everything. The bears and the eagles. It’s going to affect everything that people find amazing,” said Sterritt. “We’re not gonna see that any more. We’re not going to have those animal species – and our forests – flourishing.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8188eaab0998673fd51d79d9eb9e6a927f15cb9/0_272_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6d1ff2ea7863810ffbe354590d3054f4","title":"london fashion week goes digital seven things we learned","story":"The menswear shows went digital for the first time last weekend. But did it work? The fashion desk takes a look at this unique event A video conversation between the London mayor and editor-in-chief of British Vogue was a twofold affair, as they discussed George Floyd and systemic racism alongside Covid19 and its effect on the British fashion industry. But it was as candid and it was crucial – who suffers the most in a recession? What is the impact of pre-existing structural inequality in society? How do we prevent unemployment in the fashion sector? And why do we need to wear masks?With regards fashion, they talked about the need to promote the contribution made by the fashion industry during the pandemic, from the economy (one in six jobs British jobs are within the fashion industry, said Khan, it is “our golden egg”) and the people that work in “the pipelines” to the industry’s mass production of PPE and the future of creative graduates. As Khan said: “we don’t want creative talent leaving to go to countries that will better support them than ours.” MFLockdown forced Fletcher to rethink his collection, resulting in a streamlined more sustainable 12 look edit that utilised the fabrics he already had in his London studio. He worked directly with a network of seamstresses he has employed on previously. “This collection is a testament to the skill and hard work of these amazing women: I dedicate this collection to them.” Less is most definitely more. HSBefore George Floyd’s murder, London-based designer Charles Jeffrey had planned to throw a virtual party during digital fashion week, promoting a capsule quarantine-produced collection in the process. Instead, he gave the platform to a handful of POC creatives, creating a digital ‘happening’ to raise money for UK Black Pride.Its stars were MC Miss Jason of Jason’s Closet dancer and choreographer Malij Nashad Sharpe singer-songwriter Rachel Chinouriri and spoken word poet Kai Isaiah Jamal. University of Westminster graduates Catherine Hudson and Halina Edwards designed clothes and spoke about their work in accompanying videos.Hudson said that her “Cool Rasta” collection was designed to distort “the male form to reflect internalized micro-aggressions” Edwards explained that she was researching the Black Curriculum alongside her fashion work “I’m just so passionate to share the wealth of education there is.” It was a powerful and exuberant half hour on the internet - and underlined the importance of ‘passing the mike,’ as Miss Jason described it, in creative professions, a development we very much hope outlasts the pandemic. HMSaturday morning’s three way zoom call between menswear designer Bianca Saunders, photographer Joshua Woods and modelwriter Jess Cole to talk about their artpoetryfashion collaboration provided food for the soul. Although at the top Saunders said that the work “didn’t have much to do with the current climate,” it was hard not to see their zine as a timely statement of lyrical black beauty and the energy that occurs when black creatives work together. “If we’re constantly seeing white narrative in front of us,” said Woods, “it becomes liberating to see narratives around black lives.”Featuring male-female twin couples dressing in Saunders’ archive collections from Spring Summer 19 and Autumn Winter 19, the photos by Woods had a nostalgic and rich feeling about them. They highlighted the gendered dichotomy of Saunders clothes which combined a feminine softness with masculine lines and fabrics like leather and denim. “My work is based around finding the similarities between each other,” said Saunders.The designer hinted that her next collection SS21 which she’s working on in lockdown would feature a sunny outlook. “I want to inject the idea that joy is really important,” she said. PEMarques Almeida – a brand set up in London by Portugese couple Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida in 2011 – have always been about community, with erse street casting a big part of their MO. But it was the arrival of two daughters, Maria and Alice, that inspired reM’Ade, a new in-house brand to use the deadstock of various factories in Portugal - as this sweet video details. Available for pre-order only, see biker jackets made from prints, and striped frilled skirts, with each piece potentially unique. It is a way to think about a new way of working, and to, as Almeida says “start by tidying up the house, and work with what you have.” LCIn the same way Priya Ahluwalia weaves strands of her dual Indian and Nigerian heritage into her sustainable patchwork designs, her presentation for London Fashion Week, explores her roots and traces what it means to be a young, mixed heritage person living in London.The presentation was shown alongside her second book, Jalebi, a digital 3D exhibition and photography book focused on a series of images taken by photographer Laurence Ellis,a loving portrayal of Southall in west London, Britain’s first Punjabi community. The images flit ‘back and forth between the imagined and real’, from shots of fanciful cars draped in beautiful patchwork blankets, to portraits of local iniduals living their everyday lives.The designer also included images of her own family, who have been a great inspiration to her since she founded her eponymous brand, and places them alongside quotes from her ‘Nana’ which illustrate the family’s experience living between India and Britain. While the exhibition is a celebration of ersity and immigration, it does not shy away from the difficulties of living in an immigrant community, and includes photographs from the 2019 Memorial march in remembrance of Gurdip Singh Chaggar who was murdered by National Front racists in 1976. All profits from Jalebi, along with the photographic print sales, will be donated to the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust and to Southall Black Sisters. Available online for £35 at ahluwaliastudio. PBDaley’s AW20 show, originally staged in January, was a highlight of LFWM. So it’s a pleasure to see a video of it, which focuses on both the clothes and the musicians - including drummer Kwake Bass - that Daley collaborated with on a site-specific composition. Daley is a big music fan and this collection has both Jimi Hendrix and the Art Ensemble of Chicago on the moodboard - along with the dreamy paintings of Guyanese artist, Frank Bowling.The Abstract Truth perhaps brings the idea of afrofuturism to style. Or, as Daley says, it shows “everything has been interconnected and continues my own creative journey connecting fashion, music and culture.” LC"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443aea372785b794b7c1d4076e28efea19a03a4a/0_950_8031_4820/master/8031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7eed5d9d1fee3df5981fd05fb8a6783","title":"rachel roddy recipe for green beans in cream with roast chicken","story":"The last days of lockdown and the early summer brings a gradual awakening to the trattoria of Rome, and the welcome return of a favourite dish of seasonal green beansHis hands on his hips, Andrea walked down the middle of the room, counting.\u0026nbspIt was the day before restaurants and trattorie could, if they adhered to a series of conditions, reopen in Rome. I happened to be walking by and noticed the metal shutters half rolled up, like sleepy eyes after two months of induced coma, so put my head round the door and shouted hello into the cavernous dimness. “That’s 72, 76, 82, plus the tables outside … 108 covers”, Andrea summed, before sitting at a table and signalling for me to join. No doubt he knows the number of covers as well as he knows the arches and velveteen seats of his father’s restaurant, the place he grew up in. He was counting in order to ide the number in two: removing half the tables and carving up the room with space is one of the regional conditions for reopening.Like his father negotiating with the fishmonger, the vein in Andrea’s neck bulged as he told me of the failure of the furlough system and read me the rest of the conditions. Clean cloths for every table, hand sanitiser at the door and for wiping down plasticised menus, masks and gloves for staff, just masks for customers until the point of eating (at no point are they to be placed on the table), no coats on hooks, no shared condiments or jars of toothpicks, no unnecessary movements or proximity, or wandering children, or lingering near the door. The list, with the exception of the cloths, reads like a roll call against the nature of a Roman family restaurant the antithesis of everything that makes them what they are. This, he summed, coupled with fear and the fact so many have so little money, meant no one would come.But they did, the next night. An older couple with their daughter and her tiny dog, three couples and two groups of four, us three, all seated on the well-spaced tables outside, the warm breeze flapping the cloths. Now it was the turn of the father’s vein to throb as he passed from table to table, each welcome filled with worry, for his staff that can’t come to work yet, that we minded the masks and the conditions. It was our turn to reassure him that we are so used to masks, we don’t even notice them and, if we do, it is because they are leopardprint that we were simply glad to be back with our legs under the thick cloths, holding heavy glasses filled with house wine and eating foil packets of salted crackers while we waited for fried anchovies, spaghetti tangled round clams and – the sign that summer is here – plates of green beans. It was the beans I enjoyed most, for their almost waxy, buttery bite, but also because they were tailed, boiled and put on a white plate with half a lemon and a slick of olive oil, then landed on the table by Augusto with a worried judder – and because they are what I always have.\u0026nbspNow it is their season, and they are plentiful and a good price, we cook greens beans at home, too, boiling them in well-salted water until they don’t squeak, then tossing them in salt, olive oil and lemon while they are still warm – all’agro. Other times I braise them with tomato, toss them with toasted hazelnuts and batons of bacon, or follow a recipe from the summer section in Margaret Costa’s Four Seasons Cookery Book and bake them with soured cream and breadcrumbs.Sitting at a spaced-out table, it is an insistent thought for me that Roman family restaurants and trattoria remind me of my Granny’s pub in Oldham. The same direct intimacy and fulfilment of a need, a familiarly and sociability (even if you are in a solitary mood) and immutability, even in the face of 12 regulations and plough lines of space and, for so many, reassurance in the face of so much uncertainty.These beans go with many things, but especially well with roast chicken, cooked the way you like best – which for me is Simon Hopkinson’s way: the chicken is ripped, rather than carved, and tossed in its own buttery juices.1.6-1.8kg chickenButter and olive oil450g green beans250ml soured creamSalt and black pepperNutmeg1 pinch caraway or dill seeds40g soft white breadcrumbs40g butter, melted, plus more for dishHeat the oven to 230C (210 fan)gas 8.

Roast for a further 50 minutes, basting twice more.While the chicken is roasting, tail the beans, cook them in boiling salted water for six minutes, then drain.\u0026nbspPut the cream in bowl, season with salt, black pepper, nutmeg and caraway or dill seeds, then add the beans and toss until coated. Tip the beans into an ovenproof dish and use a spatula to scrape in the cream.\u0026nbspMelt the butter, pull from the heat, add the breadcrumbs, stir, then tip over the beans.\u0026nbspFor the last 15 minutes of roasting, put the beans in the oven alongside the chicken, and bake until the crumbs are golden and the edges bubbling. By this stage, the bird should be golden brown all over with a crisp skin and nut-brown juices should ahve gathered in the bottom of the tin.Remove the beans from the oven and keep warm. Turn off the oven, leaving the door ajar, and leave the chicken to rest for at least 15 minutes before pulling apart and serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2756c860c272213168ba2bbf190f4965aac074e2/0_2675_5745_3447/master/5745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4411fe6a67b09b22c7d9ceb8ce32e959","title":"thomasina miers coronation chicken salad recipe","story":"Spiced roast coronation chicken thighs smothered in a yoghurt dressingThe thwack of a racket on a tennis ball, the gentle buzzing of bees, the bustle of a summer party … coronation chicken conjures up all this and more, and makes me feel all the more nostalgic given the current restrictions of life.

In the final second before it began again, with 22 men back in position after 98 days away, a voice among them gave one last instruction. “Play as if there were fans,” it said, but there were none.In Sevilla, Granada, Valencia, Barcelona, Vigo, Palma, Bilbao, Madrid and San Sebastián, stadiums stood virtually silent. In the Spanish city hit hardest by the coronavirus it was quiet too, just birdsong and the sound of the ball, players shouting and the occasional siren from the fire station behind the stand. There should have been 11,454 people at Butarque for Leganés’ vital relegation clash with Valladolid on Saturday evening. There were 247.Santiago had been a season ticket holder for 52 years but he wasn’t there and nor were Candido, Félix, Manuel, Francisco, José, Jonas, Emilia, Andrés, Pedro Antonio, Ignacio, Antonio, Francisco, Eulalio, Mariano, Saturnino, Antonio or Rafael. The other 10,282 Leganés season ticket holders weren’t either, but they hope to be back one day. Those 18 will not: all of them passed away since the last time their team played.As football returned without them and so many others this weekend, the first round of games since early March offering a vague glimpse of normality and hope, their club released a video: “if Leganés has to suffer again,” it pleaded, “let it be because of the football team.” No city in Spain registered as many coronavirus cases as Leganés, nor had an infection rate so high. The health system virtually collapsed.Severo Ochoa, the city’s biggest hospital, trebled the size of its intensive care unit and was still overwhelmed. Patients lay on floors in hospital corridors. Over 600 people died, almost 300 in a single week in late March. Hospital staff suggested the daily rate was peaking at over 10 times the normal. Police could not keep up, nor could funeral services.As the crisis began, the club rang every member over the age of 60. The fitness coach, Pol Lorente, led daily online sessions for players and the population. An appeal was opened for Severo Ochoa, raising over €250,000. They bought and delivered an ambulance. And Leganés announced that all season ticket holders will go free next year.Just in front of one of those shirts were the Leganés substitutes, all 12 of them sitting in the stand, four seats apart in their kit, gloves and masks. On the other side of the main stand, the Valladolid subs. At each end, spread out, a handful of photographers. A pitchside reporter with a microphone on a stick. Four board members per club. Half-a-dozen staff. Four ball boys, ready to wipe every ball. Six police officers. Six journalists too. And two women spraying seats and surfaces with disinfectant.La Liga was back and like every other ground, Butarque had been disinfected the night before, before two buses turned up for each team – players are not allowed to sit next to each other. Referees arrived through a different entrance. At the gate in the corner, temperatures were taken before being allowed in. Rucksacks were disinfected and bags handed out containing gloves, mask and wipes.Before kick-off, everyone is escorted to their seats, wearing bibs. As the players warm up, there is music (ACDC’s Thunderstruck) but it doesn’t last long. The teams are read out to no one in particular. A couple of players even get a cheer. They go in, come out, the anthem plays, there is a minute’s silence and then they’re ready. Or not.It takes less than 100 seconds for Valladolid to lead, and it’s a gift. Leganés Chidozie Awaziem heads a nothing ball past his own goalkeeper, Pichu Cuéllar, who isn’t in his goal – and Enes Ünal runs it in. “God!” screams the keeper, heard from the stands. “Carry on, carry on, it’s OK,” someone up there says, but everything has changed already.Leganés had planned a long, physical game, their five changes to be employed later on, but now they trail. “That first goal was a hammer blow it left us groggy,” Javier Aguirre says after the game. What he says during the game is a steady stream of instructions: hold, wait, make it, don’t touch him. A few metres away, Valladolid coach Sergio González wants two lines, he says. Behind them both, the subs are talking too, a lot.It doesn’t feel like chance: they clap, cajole, cheer, instruct and appeal anything and everything, like a mini supporters’ club conscious of the void they’re trying to fill. “In training we tried to simulate the scenario as much as we could, including the fact that there’s no fans,” Sergio says. “They all had a part to play: players, staff, doctors, players in the stands. When you see them sitting up there helping their teammates, correcting then, it makes you proud.”Mostly, the shouts are standard enough, the soundtrack of any given park on any given Sunday. But then there’s the ball: hit so much harder, cleaner, every contact loud. Football looks different at professional level as it turns out, it sounds a bit different too. Close your eyes and you can hear some passes, the variety: tac or thump or whatever the move requires. Headers thud like their skulls are made of granite.And yet at the same time, when it’s like this, stripped of supporters, noise and some of its meaning, football doesn’t feel so far off the game everyone plays. Football without fans is not football, people say. But it is. It’s only football, the game and nothing else. Until, that is, someone whacks the music on full blast at half-time.The second half starts and Sergio wants control, calm. Aguirre starts to move, unable to be still, talking to anyone who will listen and many who won’t: the linesman nearest him probably isn’t enjoying this much. “Don’t e in,” he says, so his defenders don’t, but Óscar Plano escapes just in front of him, runs into the area, clips the ball across and Raúl Carnero has his shot blocked. The rebound comes to Rubén Alcaráz who smashes it into the net and Valladolid’s substitutes leap up, cheering and clapping. The birds sing. With just over 35 minutes to go it’s 2-0, the match, maybe even the first ision, slipping from Leganés’s grasp.There’s a foul. Aguirre hammers the top of the bench, fist on metal. “What a son of a bitch,” he says, repeatedly. The pace quickens, although it’s not a great game in truth. Replaced, Roque Mesa directs play from the stands, ice strapped to his thigh. Leganés get a penalty and Óscar scores with six minutes left. The home substitutes, long since on their feet, come further down the stand, drawn towards the match below them. They shout for a handball. The Valladolid players shout back, no way. Roger Assalé goes down and they scream for the referee to have a look, but he doesn’t.There’s another appeal, louder this time, a shout of handball. The referee pauses then continues. It’s obvious, they say, but he doesn’t agree. The final seconds slip away. Launch it into the area, someone shouts. Another satisfying thud and it’s headed out again, the final whistle going. Valladolid are lifted seven points clear, Leganés are left three from safety.Aguirre and Sergio bump fists and disappear immediately down the tunnel, with no one to wave at or applaud. The journalists leave, sitting in cars from where they connect remotely to a press conference taking place barely 50 metres away, their faces appearing on a screen set up in front of the manager, each question preceded, like every other conversation during lockdown, by a query: “Can you hear me?”The home manager is wearing blue gloves and a serious look. “I showed the players a lovely video the fans did to encourage them and we couldn’t have been better motivated. This is an opportunity lost, but we’ll keep fighting: there’s no time for laments,” he says. Then he gets ups and walks out, leaving an empty press room behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bdf5e9ffccff98747a663bd8a1a5131d499dc31/0_382_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=669560bfcc8c2f6ac04df89e0142863a","title":"being online has helped us survive how e commerce can kickstart your small business in lockdown and beyond","story":"Many SMEs have had to ramp up their digital activity in response to the challenges of Covid-19, learning as they go. Here, three businesses share what they’ve discoveredGiven the way that we shop is changing, it has never been more important for retailers to get online. In a survey for the website builder GoDaddy, a fifth of micro businesses said they had gone online for the first time during lockdown and nearly half that their use of digital and social media tools had increased.For some, e-commerce has always been part of the plan. The artisan hot chocolate company Knoops opened its first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013, and went on to open a London store in February this year, with more planned. But head of marketing Anna Chapman says that having an online presence was always a key part of the company’s strategy. “Chocolate has a broad appeal, and we wanted to be able to reach people in their homes, especially those who didn’t live near our stores,” she says.\u0026nbspThe company’s website centres around its hot chocolate maker, the Knoopifier, with owners getting access to online subscriptions for pouches of “Knoopifier” chocolate buttons delivered to their home. The website has always been an important part of the company’s strategy, but Chapman says that lockdown emphasised this further.\u0026nbsp“While our doors were closed, it was obviously the only way we could take any revenue at all, and we were able to focus our efforts entirely on our website and social media channels,” she says. “This importance will remain – the majority of retailers now accept that an omnichannel approach is vital. Our current situation has been an extremely stark reminder of its importance.”For other SMEs, while a website may have been part of their business, using it to sell is a recent addition. Rob Wilson, “chief toaster” at Toast Ale, a craft beer brewer that uses bread which would otherwise be wasted, says that despite having an online presence, it wasn’t really part of the business’s strategy.\u0026nbspBut when those sales channels were cut off during lockdown, Toast Ale, which donates its profits to sustainability charities, was forced to shift its sales online. “We started to rebuild our website and have far more focus on a more functional online shop. It has massively transformed our business and helped us survive – it’s become a huge opportunity to reach a whole new audience. We just hadn’t thought about it as a sales channel and now we’ve suddenly realised its potential.”Similarly, Chris Fryer, founder of the vegan pie business Magpye, hadn’t really explored e-commerce, instead selling pies from his converted horse box at events and supplying local pubs in the north of England. “We had a full calendar of events booked. We were supplying pubs with pies and had just expanded, dropping off to four or five pubs twice a week. Then our income stopped – it was a cliff-edge.”\u0026nbspLike Wilson at Toast Ale, Fryer realised quickly that he would have to shift to e-commerce and has been similarly amazed by the effect it has had.\u0026nbsp“At the moment we’re just doing local deliveries across the north east but we’re looking into expanding. Our plan potentially is to sell our horsebox and become a web-based pie shop,” he says.When it comes to setting up an e-commerce site, there is an increasingly wide range of tools available to business owners from a range of sources. They include web hosting companies such as GoDaddy, which has created Open We Stand – a portal of resources for small businesses during lockdown. Fryer says that while he has some experience building websites, it was quicker and easier to turn to readymade tools with GoDaddy.“I had the domain registered with GoDaddy but had done nothing with it. Once it became clear we would have to move online I started looking into it. I could have gone down the route of coding it from scratch but it would have taken a week or two, especially things like payment options. With the GoDaddy tools it took half a day, then I spent a day or two testing and it was ready to go. Although we didn’t use the option, I knew GoDaddy would build the site for you for free if you needed,” he says.“They do a free three-month trial, so there’s really nothing to lose by having a go. The admin side, monitoring it, doing the orders is all quite simple, so even if you’ve got no skills whatsoever I don’t think many people would struggle with it.”At Toast Ale, the switch was led by COO Louisa Ziane, who has experience of managing websites. Wilson is adamant that the work has paid off, with e-commerce proving an “amazing opportunity”, not just now but, he believes, in the future. “I would say that at current rates we’re looking at probably half a million pounds of revenue coming from our online shop. Last year as a business we took around £1m in total, so that shows that it is very quickly becoming a significant part of our business.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed. Over 50 companies have joined the cause, including Slack, Salesforce, PayPal, and more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc1f8e50fd583471a0543292c6ccdd1e916ae1a4/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b11342e3fbe1321d9b47bccc4bad13d","title":"lockdown shopping have you ordered items that werent what you expected","story":"Whether you ordered the wrong item or it it wasn’t quite what you expected, we’d like to hear from youWith around 50,000 new businesses signing up to eBay UK in April, more people appear to be buying online due to lockdown.If you have ordered an item that was not quite what you expected, we want to hear from you.What did you buy and why was it unexpected?

They live in Perth, Australia, and are expecting their first babyJana Ďoubalova was on her way to a remote part of Iceland for a hiking trip with a friend when she bumped into Chris Curnow at Reykjavik airport in July 2017. “I was off to join a crew on a tall ship that was sailing to Greenland,” he says. “I was looking out for crew members when I spotted Jana.”To kickstart conversation, Chris asked if she was part of the sailing trip. “I was happily single at the time, but as soon as we met I suddenly thought it might be worth reconsidering,” says Jana. They were on the same flight to Ísafjörður, from where Chris’s ship departed. It was delayed, so they had plenty of time to chat in the airport. “I was immediately taken by her intelligence. We were smiling and laughing together. I was spellbound.”When they arrived, he invited Jana and her friend to join him and his crewmates at a pub. “Due to the seating arrangement, I didn’t get much chance to speak to her.” They swapped numbers, but, as he was from Australia and she lived in the Czech Republic, they assumed they would never see each other again. Jana left for her hike around the Hornstrandir peninsula. “I did send her a text message, but she was out of signal,” says Chris.He then set sail, but the ship’s captain decided another night in the fjords was required before they travelled across the Greenland Strait. “We had been hiking when we spotted their ship,” says Jana. “We thought they’d be in Greenland by then, but then we realised it was them.” Seizing the moment, Chris ran to give her a quick kiss goodbye.Later that day, Jana received the text message he had sent, so she replied: “I never thought it would happen, but I asked him if he wanted to come to Prague for a few days after his trip was over.” It was not until a month later that Chris received the message. “I didn’t even hesitate. I immediately rearranged my flights so I could come for a few days on my way back to Australia.” But when he finally got hold of Jana to tell her, she told him she was in France with her family. Due to a family tragedy, Chris was unable to stay until she returned. “He left gifts with his friend to pass on to me,” says Jana. “It was very romantic.”They continued chatting and in October Jana took 10 days off to visit Perth. “All my friends and family were supportive, but they also thought I was crazy,” she says. They enjoyed exploring the city together and took a trip around south-western Australia. “I was so nervous, but it worked. I had no doubts from the first moment,” says Chris. At Christmas, Jana returned for two months. “I was working freelance as an interpreter. It meant we could spend longer together.” Chris was able to continue his work for an environmental NGO.In March 2018, he went to Europe to visit Jana. Shortly afterwards, he enrolled in a Czech language course. “That summer, I made a huge sign in Czech asking if she would marry me. I unfolded it in the arrivals hall in Prague.” They continued their long-distance relationship while they planned the wedding. But in December that year, Chris had a near-fatal accident while on a hike in the Blue Mountains near Sydney. “He had to be rescued by helicopter it was terrifying,” says Jana. The pair ended up spending the next few months at his family home in New South Wales while he recovered.They married in November 2019 and Jana moved to Perth permanently. They are expecting their first baby in December. “Chris is an adventurer and loves to explore. I love his courage,” says Jana. “We have a really close friendship.” Chris says he appreciates his partner’s loving nature. “For the previous 10 years, I had never managed to find a soulmate. I always believed in the hope of never knowing what was around the corner. Jana is incredible.”Want to share your story?

He talks about drugs, racism, police brutality – and the healing power of musicAt the age of 17, William “Bootsy” Collins packed up his homemade bass guitar and left home to tour the world with James Brown. He was heading off in pursuit of the funk. Or, as he calls it now – aged 68, in his high-pitched rasp down the phone from Cincinnati, Ohio – “the fonk”.\u0026nbspIn the five decades since, Collins’s bass has changed the shape of music. Not only did he play on some of Brown’s best-known and most political records – Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine, Superbad and Soul Power – but he has also had a hand in pop hits from Deee-Lite’s Groove Is in the Heart to Fatboy Slim’s Weapon of Choice and Snoop Dogg’s What’s My Name (Snoop Dogg). After working with Brown, he would discover LSD, join George Clinton’s Parliament-Funkadelic and help carry the torch for unapologetic bohemian black music after Jimi Hendrix’s death. He found his signature style – star-shaped sunglasses, skin-tight leathers and top hats – and became an icon of afrofuturism.Born in 1951 in Cincinnati, Collins spent his childhood with his guitarist brother, Phelps, AKA “Catfish”, and his mother – who worked several jobs to make ends meet. “Growing up, we were tough,” Collins says. “We came up during the civil rights riots. We were street kids.”On the day we speak, it is a week on from the horrifying police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Protests are erupting throughout the US, and Donald Trump has called for aggressive policing. Having lived through the civil rights movement, does he feel this is a moment of reckoning for race in the US?\u0026nbspWhat has changed, he says, is the availability of images of police brutality. “Now, everybody sees when these incidents happen. There’s no secret, it’s recorded, it’s straight out into the world. We’ve been through enough and we need to come together. I know it has been said for ever, but it feels like time really is running out now.”In typical Collins fashion, his response to the global pandemics of Covid-19 and systemic racism comes in his own brand of galactic funk. Holed up in his ranch –\u0026nbspknown as Bootzilla –\u0026nbspCollins has been spending the lockdown finalising his 10th solo album, The Power of the One. “It’s been a strange time really good for music, but bad in many other ways.” While the album is not due until October, a charity single, Stars, was released last week, featuring a sample of the academic Cornel West talking powerfully on CNN, in the wake of Floyd’s killing, about the ways the US has failed its black citizens. “Covid gave me some time to reset,” Collins says. “I decided to put something out that was uplifting and that would hopefully help heal the planet.”Collins genuinely believes music has the power to heal. “Funk just brings people together, from the ground up,” he says. “It doesn’t have nothing to do with colour. It has nothing to do with status. It just brings you to ‘the one’, and the one thing that we all have in common is that we all just want to live. That’s what it’s really all about. It’s making something from nothing, like me.”Growing up, Collins and his brother had “two dollars a week between us”, he says. Catfish, who was seven years Bootsy’s senior, got a guitar first. “I started off trying to emulate him by playing the guitar. I would hang out with him and his band, trying to see if they would let me join.” One day, they needed a bassist. So he improvised. “I took this guitar we had and just put bass strings on it and that was all it took –\u0026nbspI was a bass player.”The pair started spending time at the local King Records studio, hoping to run into more prominent acts that might recruit them as a backing band. Their break came when a record executive, Charles Spurling, heard them play and enlisted them as the band for blues and black country-and-western acts such as Bill Doggett, Hank Ballard and Arthur Prysock.It was when Brown heard them in 1969, though, that they struck gold. Brown had been recording at the King studios and was just entering his gly cape-wearing “godfather of soul” phase. “When James Brown came along, suddenly we were living the big life. We got all the girls and we would get loaded,” he says. “What else could a kid want?”\u0026nbspBrown would provide much more than fame, women and drugs, however. While his own success was reaching frenzied levels internationally, he was also gaining notoriety for his domineering and overbearing presence. His previous backing band had walked out after disagreements over pay and he had started to fine members for lateness or mistakes. “I never had a father and he took that role on. He did a good job. I needed that discipline. I would do any kind of wild thing otherwise.” He was never fearful of Brown. “He couldn’t intimidate us like the others because we were already tough.”Over the course of 11 months spent with Brown as part of the backing band, the JBs, Collins rehearsed until his fingers bled, trying to hone in on the heartbeat of this nascent, stridently black genre of music. The group toured and recorded relentlessly, making a “homecoming” trip to Africa and visiting Fela Kuti in Nigeria, who afterwards kept up a friendly rivalry with Brown.As with any father-and-son relationship, though, the rebellious streak soon emerged in teenage Collins. “James would start accusing me of being high, even when I wasn’t, so one day I just decided to drop acid to prove him right,” he says. The consequences were, of course, disastrous. “You had to be so tight with his music, there was no way you could play it when you were high. He called me into the back room and I was out of my mind – my bass had turned into a snake – and he fired me, but I just couldn’t stop laughing. I don’t remember what happened with the rest of that night.”Being in Parliament-Funkadelic “was just total freedom”, Collins says. “It was like being finally accepted. We could play whatever we wanted and fully express ourselves in whatever we wanted to wear, too. There were no walls between us and the sky, you could just keep reaching and reaching.”\u0026nbspThere followed an intensely creative decade of work with Clinton and his P-Funk collective, with Collins part of Parliament-Funkadelic, as well as playing with his own Bootsy’s Rubber Band and under the names Caspar the Funky Ghost and Bootzilla. He even landed a solo US No 1 with 1978’s playful single Bootzilla. After Hendrix’s death in 1970, Collins and Clinton were some of the few black musicians continuing his legacy, now with added theatrics. While Hendrix may have torched his guitar in a state of devotional rapture at Monterey Pop festival, by 1976 Parliament-Funkadelic had built their own “spaceship” under the chaotic leadership of Dr Funkenstein –\u0026nbspone of Clinton’s alter egos. The P-Funk Earth tour, in which the mothership landed on stage, was a carnival spectacle of celebratory blackness.\u0026nbsp“When we brought the spaceship down to the stage, it was like a religious revival,” Collins says. “We realised we were a part of a bigger thing, a larger expression of community. When the mothership would come down, there was this rapture it was like the first time you made love and you would never forget it.” It was a new vision of audience communion, something akin to the hippy love-ins of the previous decade.But the party couldn’t last. “I was losing touch with myself and it was hard to separate the Bootsy on stage from the person I was beneath the outfits,” Collins says. “I wasn’t in a very good place and I realised I was in too deep.” With help from his partner, Patti, he got sober in the mid-80s. Collins married Patti in 1996 and she now helps him run the Bootsy Collins Foundation, a charitable organisation for children’s musical education.By the time he returned to music in 1988, with the electrofunk record What’s Bootsy Doin’?, hip-hop was in the ascendant. It was a genre predicated on the sampling of P-Funk and Brown. That same year, NWA released their debut album, Straight Outta Compton. Dr Dre of NWA was so indebted to the P-Funk sound that he would call his later work G-funk. In a matter of a few years, Collins had morphed from the young, prodigal tearaway of a tumultuous funk orgy into an elder statesman of a revered genre a superhero of the bass.Today, it is this legacy on which he is focused. This summer, Collins will restart his online Funk University, providing tutorials and lessons for aspiring musicians. “We have to nurture the talent that we have now, as it’s just so much more difficult for them to get noticed,” he says. “The funk is in the power of the one and so we have to work together to spread that message. That’s what I’m interested in.”It might seem trite or overly optimistic for Collins to be so focused on a blanket message of unity while race relations in the US feel on the verge of an irrevocable and violent rift. Yet hope has seen him through other dark times, such as the trauma of the late 60s. \u0026nbsp“People are so status-obsessed and they just don’t realise that we are all the same, that this whole Earth is our mothership and we’re all on board,” he says softly. “You can laugh if you want to, because I’ve been laughed at before, but none of that means anything to me any more. What means something is that we all get a chance to get heard and that we help each other out. We’re all funky, just not all of us know it.”Bootsy Collins’s Stars is out now all proceeds from the streams and downloads go to the MusiCares Covid-19 relief fund"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7637d9300e411b6a7bde70d4d55bcae06626d391/0_207_4996_2998/master/4996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f0ab4af87413f7393bb38684c3022a4","title":"keith tippett the jazz great music","story":"He had an alchemical instinct for bringing together progressive rock and a new jazz generation – and the results were magicWhen his daughter Inca was small, Keith Tippett overheard her saying that her father was a “mujician”. It was a title he appropriated for an outstanding series of solo piano recordings, but it fitted most of the things he did during a long and varied career. If Tippett was on the bandstand, in whatever musical context, however spontaneous or prepared, magic was likely to occur.It took some sort of alchemical instinct to dream up and then carry off the 1970 project called Centipede, a band of 50 musicians – 100 legs – featuring members of King Crimson, Soft Machine, Blossom Toes and Patto, alongside a classical string section and free-jazz musicians from groups such as the Spontaneous Music Ensemble and Brotherhood of Breath. The audience assembled for their debut at the Lyceum theatre in London could see Robert Wyatt, Karl Jenkins, Zoot Money, Robert Fripp and the singer formerly known as Julie Driscoll rubbing shoulders as they performed a sprawling piece titled Septober Energy, in which the composer attempted to present all the facets of his extraordinary orchestra.As an example of what has been called Tippett’s “utopian” outlook, it took some beating. At times prolix, at others exhilarating, veering from the most delicate of textural explorations to full-on heavy rock and unfettered free improvisation while privileging no inidual reputations, it symbolised the open attitudes of a particular time and place, one in which Tippett could appear on Top of the Pops with King Crimson, playing free-jazz piano on their single, Cat Food, and the teenaged Mike Oldfield could leave the Lyceum after the Centipede gig with the germ of the idea for Tubular Bells.Glimpsing a potentially profitable interface between progressive rock and a new jazz generation, the music business showed an interest. When he arrived in London from his native Bristol in the late 60s, Tippett had assembled a sextet of young players. They made an album for Giorgio Gomelsky, the record producer who had been involved with the Rolling Stones and managed the Yardbirds. Their second album was for Vertigo, the progressive rock imprint of the giant Phillips company. Neon, RCA’s progressive sub-label, was the vehicle for the recorded version of Septober Energy.No doubt, given the names involved, the company had been hoping for a hit of some sort. But it failed to sell in significant quantities, and when Tippett, in a typical display of artistic fearlessness, then presented them with a couple of albums of small-group free improvisations, not even the presence of Julie – by then Tippett’s wife, adopting his surname in its original form, as Julie Tippetts – could retain their interest. Thereafter Tippett’s albums were released by small labels specialising in the more adventurous end of jazz and improvisation.The era of general optimism for that generation ended in the middle of the 1970s, when the record industry realised that the money was elsewhere, but Tippett remained a positive force in British music. His core belief was that when the music started, goodness would happen. Not just good music but good human connections. In 1987, he and Julie released their first album as a duo, Couple in Spirit, a title perfectly describing a relationship that survived long periods when work was hard to find.In his youth, Tippett had been a chorister and a church organist, and the one thing his music always did, however extreme its procedures, was sing. A rare, wonderful and very personal lyricism pervaded even Linükea, his extended piece for piano and string quartet, premiered at the Bath festival in 1996.His solo piano concerts were intimate epics in which virtuosity was placed in the service of spontaneous creativity and the profound joy of discovery. His duos, sometimes with fellow pianists Howard Riley and Stan Tracey, were marvels of empathy. His continuing interest in larger ensembles was shown by the creation of Ark, a smaller, acoustic version of Centipede, in 1978, by his role in the Dedication Orchestra in 1992, by his performances in Italy with Pino Minafra’s Canto General, and by the octet, his last band, with which he recorded The Nine Dances of Patrick O’Gonogon, a suite based on Irish folk themes in which he braided all the strands of music that had formed him into one glorious summary.Before a performance of that work in Berlin in 2015, I was surprised, after knowing him for almost the entirety of his 50-year professional career, to discover how nervous and fretful he could become before a performance. Anyone presenting Tippett at a festival or on a concert stage needed the local piano tuner’s home number on speed-dial, even though the pristine Steinway had been tuned twice already on the day of performance. But when the music started, all anxiety dissolved and the spontaneous magic took over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad751714c2e50096485fd95173ba88b35a16c5d6/0_225_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=076c5d9353478fdfdd2d7e30ae50ad27","title":"pet shop boys where to start in their back catalogue","story":"In Listener’s digest, we help you explore the work of great musicians. Next: the peerless pop duo who elegantly delved into the big issuesReleased in 1987, Actually opens with a seemingly disparate drum roll, Dancing Queen glissando and the squeal of car tyres, and rockets into a succinct 10 songs that bring the lecture hall to the club. Anchored by Neil Tennant’s deadpan delivery, highbrow doesn’t so much meet lowbrow as invites it in and spends a very pleasant evening debating socioeconomic issues with it before taking it out for a sweaty make-out sesh in a high-NRG club.\u0026nbspRather than sticking to mindless hooks and vapid lyricism as some of their contemporaries did, the Pet Shop Boys elegantly delved into big issues. It’s a Sin picks apart the dichotomy of being Catholic and gay, mixing monastic chanting, reverential echo and house-felling drops. It Couldn’t Happen Here was one of three songs Tennant wrote about the Aids crisis and its specific effect on and subsequent passing of a friend. It has the feel of a quivering lip in a stoic face, a reasoned argument when all you want to do is rage. (The strings were arranged by Angelo Badalamenti, but recorded on a Fairlight when nobody remembered to book an actual orchestra).But amid the soul-searching, there’s the pure pop adrenaline of Heart, the wonderful silliness of Shopping and the utter perfection of What Have I Done to Deserve This?, a duet with a mid-slump Dusty Springfield.\u0026nbspThe beauty of the Pet Shop Boys, and of Actually in particular, is the deftness with which they manoeuvre from all-out pop to elegiac melancholy and back again. They understood, instinctively, that pop music was not to be underestimated, revelling in it rather than sneering or cynically exploiting it for commercial gain. The result is an album that barely feels like it’s aged in the era of 80s revivalism. Sparklingly clever and skirting naff like a strobe light on a dancefloor, Actually is that rare thing: a second album that pleased everyone.\u0026nbsp“It’s fundamental that what we do only exists in our own universe,” Tennant told Melody Maker around the release of 1990’s Behaviour. “When you like Pet Shop Boys, you are in our world.” That world, which had been all camp-couture and adrenaline-surging pop, was about to graduate into something more sombre.\u0026nbspThe melancholy Behaviour marked the end of the Boys’ imperial period – the age when that secret recipe for hits was infallible – as they entered a more reflective era. Being Boring, which Tennant and Lowe had been sure was a hit, flopped in the charts but has long been a fan favourite, not just because of the petulance of the title (coined after they were accused of “being boring”) and the indignant hook but also because of its subject matter, namely the same friend whose death Tennant sang about in It Couldn’t Happen Here. Being Boring tracks the move from adolescence to adulthood and, in parallel, from health to death.\u0026nbspBehaviour has come to be seen as a gateway from the 80s Pets into 90s Pets. It saw them experimenting with musical arrangements that hinted at their future theatrical aspirations, albeit under woozy synthscapes. “Also it probably didn’t have irritatingly crass ideas in it,” Tennant later said, “like our songs often do.” Which is quite something for an album that includes songs titled How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously? and My October Symphony.\u0026nbspOn 2002’s Release, sad-lad guitar music had infiltrated the Pets’ world. Thankfully they’d got that out of their system and by 2013’s Electric, Johnny Marr’s six-string was out and thumping dance and vocals beamed in from another planet were in. With the weight of 11 studio albums behind them, they were wary of making something that sounded like a carbon copy of what they’d done before. The brief producer Stuart Price received was: Electric was to be a dance record. Every track, even the down tempo ones, were to have “that euphoric, fresh feel”.\u0026nbspIt is near impossible to listen to Electric without closing your eyes and feeling the dancefloor around you the lights swirling behind your eyelids, the feel of bodies pressing against you from all angles. The searing joy of dance underpins the entire album lyrics are sparse and Lowe’s arrangements given space to shine. In some ways, the yearning romance of Love is a Bourgeois Construct is peak Pet Shop Boys: the music is based on a Michael Nyman piece, which in turn was based on a Henry Purcell piece, while the lyrics tell the story of an intellectual abandoned by their lover, based on a passage in David Lodge’s 1988 novel Nice Work. It’s also a huge, incomparable banger.\u0026nbspThe Pet Shop Boys love remixes. Having another artist rework their songs is the only way for Tennant and Lowe to hear their music as fans do – and this first remix record was something of a screw you to anyone who’d ever described any of their songs as radio-unfriendly. Some tracks from Please and some B-sides were reworked by the Pets themselves and frequent Pets producers Julian Mendelssohn and Shep Pettibone, among others. The result is a short album that speaks to the unending versatility of song and the Pets Shop Boys’ view of their music as a living entity that can be set free rather than be closely guarded.\u0026nbspIt’s almost impossible to pick a deep cut from the Pets’ vast back catalogue: their love of remixes, their host of albums, collaborations, covers, gorgeously inventive live performances, entire musical shows … so I’ve picked a deeply sad one. It’s easy to get wrapped up in the poppers o’clock hits because the Pets are peerless in that arena but they’re also masters of the tragic – and this moving Christmas ballad about Jesus’s return to Earth only to be murdered in a racist attack is about as lushly tragic as it gets.Literally, by Chris HeathIn possibly the greatest music book ever written, journalist Chris Heath joins the Pet Shop Boys on tour in Japan in the late 80s and spends hours talking with them about absolutely everything. (There is a lot of shopping.) Incredibly detailed, thoroughly entertaining – and the ending is a peerless kiss-off to everyone’s favourite troll, Piers Morgan.\u0026nbspOne Hundred Lyrics and a Poem, by Neil TennantAs author of some of the silliest, cleverest and most impressively intellectual lyrics in the game, Tennant’s anthology is worth poring over. His brief but entertaining anecdotes on each of the songs he’s chosen are entertaining and illuminating in equal measure.\u0026nbspImperial, by Tom EwingNeil Tennant was the man who coined the term “imperial phase”, namely the period when a pop star simply cannot put a foot wrong. In this contemporary examination of the phrase and how it relates to both the Pet Shop Boys and modern pop, Ewing tracks not only the group’s own imperial phase but also the band’s legacy.

Thirteen years later, with the mystery still unsolved, German police revealed they had a new prime suspect. Is there now a conclusion in sight?Last week, prosecutors in Germany held a press conference to update the media on a story that has gripped the world for over a decade. There was a new lead in the search for the missing British girl Madeleine McCann, who disappeared at the age of three in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz.  reporters Esther Addley and Sandra Laville have covered the story for 13 years, through the false leads, wrongly named suspects and a maelstrom of wild rumours, many focused on the girl’s devastated parents. They tell Rachel Humphreys what it was about this case that made it a national obsession – and what a resolution would mean.

In early March, as the world shut down, she found herself flying to Crete to undergo treatmentIn early March, the music journalist and broadcaster Laura Barton arrived in Heraklion, Crete to begin solo IVF treatment. After multiple miscarriages and a relationship breakup the previous year, Laura decided to try and have a child by herself. Her local health authority did not treat single women, so Laura opted for Greece, where she had been told there were good, affordable clinics. Laura tells Rachel Humphreys about flying out of London just as the coronavirus pandemic was sweeping through Europe. She arrived in Greece the day the country began its lockdown. Undergoing IVF at any time is a peculiar experience, she says. But in the midst of a pandemic, it became surreal.

Barely a gym lets a cross-training machine go unaccompanied by hi-NRG dance tunes. There’s a great choice of running playlists on Spotify, some with millions of likes from users who’ve found that the right music can push them farther and faster. Bruce Springsteen has even written a whole album about being born to run. But if you want to use music to help improve your running, it’s important to get to grips with the science, and how it applies to your running style.Given that most runners tend to follow a pace of 150 to 180 steps per minute, you need music that corresponds to that. One option is to pick music that has about 150-180bpm, so that you can match your steps to the beat. “Foo Fighters’ The Pretender, which has about 170bpm, is really, really popular with runners,” says Hallett.However, 150-180bpm is very fast in terms of tempo, so there’s relatively little recorded at those speeds – with the exception of more high-energy rock’n’roll, thrash metal or speed garage. So another option is to aim for music that matches your stride cycle – ie two steps rather than one. This lets you pick music that’s much slower. Something that’s particularly good? Hip-hop.One of the most pleasant ways to run is to do so in what’s known as a “flow state”. It’s a highly enjoyable feeling of being completely immersed in what you’re doing to the point where it’s as though you’re on autopilot, but which is in itself highly enjoyable. It’s also been shown to enhance running endurance.Karageorghis did a study where he ran people to exhaustion during a beep test and found that those who listened to music more easily entered flow state. But in order to enter flow state, it’s important to have the right listening experience. The more continuous the listening experience, the easier it is to enter flow state. So if you’re planning to go on a reasonably lengthy run, it’s best to avoid music with ads, and to ensure you’re not listening in a way that might be interrupted by poor signal. Using Spotify Premium, with ad-free music and offline listening, is one way to keep the flow state flowing, if you will. “Having interrupted music can be a little distracting and disconcerting – it’s not as beneficial as having continuous music,” says Karageorghis. “That’s why I often encourage people to create end-to-end playlists that contour their workout.”One of the most important ways that music can help take your running to the next level is by making you feel less tired when you exercise. When you’re listening to a soundtrack, you’re giving your brain something to process other than your physical activity. The music distracts it from focusing on the effect exercise is having on your body, so the parts of the brain that speak to each other to communicate fatigue are less able to do so – meaning you feel less exhausted than you otherwise would.“It’s as though the music takes up some of your brain’s bandwidth that would normally be used for communication with the working muscles and the organs,” says Karageorghis. “It limits the degree to which fatigue-related signals can enter conscious awareness.”One thing that is unaffected by how fast you’re running is music’s ability to make you feel like you’re enjoying yourself. Even at higher intensities, studies have found that music can make people enjoy exercise more than they otherwise would.Karageorghis has also found that not only does music enhance how pleasurable your run is, but it enhances your memory of your run. It makes you remember your runs more positively, associates them more with being positive experiences and increases your probability of running more frequently. As to the right type of music to ensure that your brain responds positively to running? That depends entirely on you.“It’s often to do with the personal associations that the music has for you,” says Hallett. “I had a participant who listened to music from their university days because it took them back to a time when they had less responsibility. Going on a run felt like a bit of escapism for them. Others were motivated by music that reminded them of people they knew. It depends what has meaning to you.”Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

They may not arrive in a vast spaceship. But according to new calculations there could be more than 30 intelligent civilisations in our galaxy today capable of communicating with others.Experts say the work not only offers insights into the chances of life beyond Earth but could shed light on our own future and place in the cosmos.“I think it is extremely important and exciting because for the first time we really have an estimate for this number of active intelligent, communicating civilisations that we potentially could contact and find out there is other life in the universe – something that has been a question for thousands of years and is still not answered,” said Christopher Conselice, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Nottingham and a co-author of the research.In 1961 the astronomer Frank Drake proposed what became known as the Drake equation, setting out seven factors that would need to be known to come up with an estimate for the number of intelligent civilisations out there. These factors ranged from the the average number of stars that form each year in the galaxy through to the time over which a civilisation would be expected to be sending out detectable signals.Now Conselice and colleagues report in the Astrophysical Journal how they refined the equation with new data and assumptions to come up with their estimates.He added that, while it is a speculative theory, he believes alien life would have similarities in appearance to life on Earth. “We wouldn’t be super shocked by seeing them,” he said.Under the strictest set of assumptions – where, as on Earth, life forms between 4.5bn and 5.5bn years after star formation – there are likely between four and 211 civilisations in the Milky Way today capable of communicating with others, with 36 the most likely figure. But Conselice noted that this figure is conservative, not least as it is based on how long our own civilisation has been sending out signals into space – a period of just 100 years so far.Dr Oliver Shorttle, an expert in extrasolar planets at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the research, said several as yet poorly understood factors needed to be unpicked to make such estimates, including how life on Earth began and how many Earth-like planets considered habitable could truly support life.Dr Patricia Sanchez-Baracaldo, an expert on how Earth became habitable, from the University of Bristol, was more upbeat, despite emphasising that many developments were needed on Earth for conditions for complex life to exist, including photosynthesis. “But, yes if we evolved in this planet, it is possible that intelligent life evolved in another part of the universe,” she said.Prof Andrew Coates, of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London, said the assumptions made by Conselice and colleagues were reasonable, but the quest to find life was likely to take place closer to home for now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efe3abe3b7f793b73c9a413bf172aee4f33c326e/0_0_2048_1230/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f011f5a6338c5d984e644bd965bcc2f","title":"exclusive mps call for total ban on gambling advertisements","story":"Exclusive: report proposing far tighter regulation for industry could shape government reviewGambling adverts should be banned, an influential group of more than 50 MPs and peers has concluded in a report that calls for the biggest shake-up of Britain’s gambling laws in more than a decade.MPs who have spent a year gathering evidence on gambling-related harm will on Tuesday publish proposals that could shape a government review of how the £11bn industry is regulated.The cross-party group, which has previously campaigned successfully for a ban on credit card bets and the curbing of fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), will urge much tighter controls on a sector that has grown rapidly in recent years.The proposals, seen by the , envisage a complete overhaul of the 2005 Gambling Act introduced under Tony Blair’s Labour government.The report’s most eye-catching recommendation is a total ban on advertising, a proposal that likely to face opposition from both commercial broadcasters and some gambling firms.Betting advertising has boomed since it was permitted by the 2005 Gambling Act, although the industry signed up to a voluntary restriction during daytime sports broadcasts last year.The MPs also called for independent affordability checks to ensure that people do not gamble more than they can afford, voicing concern that firms are not moving fast enough to develop such controls.“They have algorithms where if you are spending significant sums, they can make you a VIP, or send you a bonus email, both of which are to their commercial advantage,” the report said.“So, there is no reason why this data cannot be used to prevent gambling harm.”The Gambling Commission, the industry’s regulator, recently recommended curbs on controversial VIP schemes, whose members account for the majority of some companies’ income.The MPs said the commission’s proposals, including an age limit of 25 on membership of the schemes, were inadequate, and called on the commission to act “decisively” by abolishing the schemes altogether.The regulator also came in for criticism from the MPs for its overall efficacy.The MPs said it was “not fit for purpose” and echoed concerns expressed by the National Audit Office about its budget of just £19m and its failure to adapt to technological change.The Gambling Commission said it was “committed to drastically reducing gambling harm and it is untrue to say that we are not fit for purpose”.The MPs want the regulator to be significantly beefed up and complemented by a new gambling ombudsman who can address disputes between customers and firms.The publication of the group’s interim report last year wiped hundreds of millions of pounds off gambling company shares.The final report reiterates some of its proposals but also makes more detailed suggestions to better regulate potentially addictive or dangerous features of online games.This includes reducing the “spin speed” of games such as online roulette and reviewing psychological tricks such as “near misses” that imply players came close to winning and might do so if they spin again.The MPs also call for the extension of a measure – introduced by the industry during the Covid-19 lockdown at the behest of the Gambling Commission – to stop allowing reverse withdrawals.Considered a sign of problem gambling, reverse withdrawals are when a customer transfers money from their gambling account to their bank but cancels while the transaction is pending, feeding the money straight back into betting.A spokesperson for the Betting and Gaming Council, the industry lobby group, said: “We are committed to making more changes and driving up safer gambling standards further and we look forward to working with the government on their forthcoming review.“It’s important that those who claim not to be anti-gambling or prohibitionist do not drive customers to offshore, black market, illegal operators that don’t have any safeguards, rather than in our current heavily regulated industry that supports over 100,000 jobs and pays over £3bn in tax.”Matthew Gaskell, clinical lead for the NHS northern gambling clinics, said: “The report signals that we must take gambling related harm as a serious and significant public health issue for our country.“We can and must do better to ensure that we ensure that our regulations do as much as possible to protect people from the harms associated with these products.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd662c660bff4dcb41b869e27174cb0f0860a375/0_196_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af17396e7f7b48ca0bdb355c68d861ea","title":"khadijah mellah interview horse racing glorious goodwood","story":"The teenager made headlines winning at last year’s Glorious Goodwood and threatens more racing ‘chaos’ after her degree“It was a magical outcome,” Khadijah Mellah says as she remembers how her life changed last summer when, after sitting on a racehorse for the first time just a few months earlier, she won the Magnolia Cup at Goodwood. In August 2019, as the first jockey in Britain to race while wearing a hijab, the 18-year-old from Peckham urged on her horse, Haverland, to a thrilling victory which made news across the country.Mellah was in the midst of her A-levels while learning how to ride a racehorse. Her journey from the underprivileged Ebony Horse Club in Brixton to the winner’s enclosure at Glorious Goodwood was captured in Riding A Dream, an ITV documentary lit up by Mellah’s sparkling character and courage. It could lead to a feature film based on the incredible story of a young Muslim woman overcoming prejudice and subverting stereotypes.Ten months later, with the pain of institutionalised racism exploding across the world, the experience of a south London Muslim teenager conquering a predominantly white, wealthy sport is even more uplifting.“It was a wild rollercoaster journey,” Mellah says as her face cracks open with another smile. “I loved it. I wouldn’t change a thing apart from, maybe, my maths grade. Who knew that three months before you could pluck this 18-year-old, who knew nothing about the racing industry, and get them to win a race?”Mellah’s hijab gained national attention but, now, while studying mechanical engineering in Brighton, she makes a searing point about how her mother endured racism and Islamaphobia years earlier. Her mother comes from Kenya, her father from Algeria, and Mellah says: “My mum is a black Muslim woman and she used to wear a burqa. A lot of people in this country were very uncomfortable with her wearing a burqa, and they weren’t shy about telling her. She eventually took it off because it became a threat to her safety.”“It was and still is, unfortunately, a place where sometimes I don’t completely feel in my element. But I’m comfortable walking into the parade ring and talking to old friends, people I’ve ridden for, and the jockeys. I love going to the races now. But for my family it has a strange intensity.”I like chatting to Mellah because we zip all over the place. After talking about alienation and prejudice we share our mutual love of boxing. This leads to a reminder that she has a black belt in karate and rides a moped. Mellah smiles when I say anyone with preconceptions about young women who choose to wear the hijab would be educated and energised by her story. “I’ve been using people’s ignorance to my advantage throughout my life. I’m surprising people wherever I go. I’m like: ‘That’s because you have a pre‑conceived subconscious bias you shouldn’t have.’ It’s my job to change that bias.”Does she not get worn down by the predictable surprise of white people when they realise that, despite her exceptional spark, she is a normal 19-year-old? “If I think about it too much, yes. It shouldn’t be the case. Every time I chat with anyone, they’re pleasantly surprised. I thrive on that and always explain my decisions. I had a part-time job, and it wasn’t feasible cycling there. My parents and I didn’t have the financial resources for a car. The most logical route was a moped. People say: ‘Well, that makes sense.’There is a huge difference between riding a moped and a racehorse and the offer to compete in the Magnolia Cup came out of the blue at Ebony. “They just said: ‘There’s this pretty big horse race and we’re thinking of entering you.’ I’d done a little pony race ages ago so why not? They then told me a documentary was going to be made and I was like: ‘Well, this is much better than I anticipated.’”In Brixton and Peckham most people were bewildered. ‘They were like: ‘You’re in a running race?’ I was like: ‘No, on a horse.’ They said: ‘You mean betting races? Proper jockey stuff? That’s weird.’ I started training during Ramadan and that was the worst few weeks of my life. I was getting no sleep, my blood sugar levels were low, dehydration, poor vision. It was brutal.”The horses were also unimpressed. “A lot of horses took advantage of the fact I’d gone too quickly through my training,” Mellah says. “One day four camera people were documenting me at Newmarket, at the British Racing School. On my last canter, my horse decided: ‘No. We’re going to go over a million miles per hour.’ I stormed past everyone.”Mellah needed to pass a proficiency test before she could race in the Magnolia Cup. She failed so embarrassingly that “the instructor said: ‘Khadijah, I don’t know why you’re here. You’re not going to race this year.’ I was in tears. I was genuinely a wreck”.Late that night she called Bell to tell him it was all over. But he convinced the authorities to allow another test. “I did four weeks of intense training and came back to face the same instructor. He watched me with a beady eye. I was riding a different horse but he said: ‘I want her to ride the same horse, to see if she will fall off again.’ But I had improved a lot and I passed. I could race.”In the Magnolia Cup, Haverland was a 25-1 shot and, as Mellah says: “His previous history was coming fifth, third and sixth. He won once in his career when he was younger. But he didn’t like jumping out of the stalls because once he had bumped his head. He wasn’t raced much.”“My mum could not believe it. She took an iPad and accidentally left it recording. We’ve got this audio of her running around the racecourse, screaming: ‘My God. I can’t believe it. She won. I’m so glad it’s over. She won.’ It’s a very weird audio because the view is just her arm holding the iPad while she’s running to me. It’s gold – and the funniest thing.”Mellah has absorbed the magnitude of her achievement. “I now know that this is not how the racing industry works. You do not learn to ride race horses in three months. You do not then win a race within three months. It takes jockeys years to get their first ride, let alone their first win. So I now know how big a deal it was from a riding perspective. But it also impacted so many people. I was getting messages from people who didn’t even come from my background and they related to my journey. I ended up making a lot of important friendships.”“People kept asking me: ‘When is your next race?’ They didn’t understand I had entered the Magnolia Cup with the logic I was going to do this one race, have some fun, then get on with my life. It was never supposed to be life-altering. But as soon as I won I was eager to race again. Obviously it’s not so simple. I need my licence unless I do another charity race. I’m actually thinking of doing another one next year. But I want to get a licence – I don’t want to be the fake jockey. I don’t want all this public attention and not be a genuine jockey. I want that accreditation saying: ‘You’ve made it as a professional jockey.’“I was still riding when I started uni but it was difficult getting up early, travelling to the yard and making it back in time for my lectures. I would come in my riding gear, smelling of horse dung, and walk into my lab session. People were like: ‘What are you wearing?’ I’d say: ‘Don’t worry about it.’ But I was exhausted. I was carrying my gear on the bus and it took 45 minutes to get there and it was too much. So I said: ‘Let me focus on one thing. My degree.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea40af0bfa2f835126ec022f7464bf6053ebab15/0_202_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a9a19baac639442729cb24e572f2066","title":"apple news algorithms pick more celeb stories than human editors says study","story":"Automated section of app took a third of its content from two sources: CNN and Fox NewsWhen algorithms replace humans in charge of editing news, they tend to select more stories about celebrities from a less erse selection of publications, according to  research.Jack Bandy and Nicholas Diakopoulos of Northwestern University in the US analysed Apple News over a two-month period from mid-March, collecting every headline published in two sections of the popular and influential news app: Top Stories, which contains content selected by a team of human editors employed by Apple and Trending, which contains stories selected by the company’s proprietary algorithm.Across more than 4,000 headlines, the algorithms selected far more stories, from a far more concentrated selection of publications, than the human editors. Nearly a third of all the “trending” stories came from just two outlets: CNN and Fox News. Adding in the next most favoured two, People magazine and BuzzFeed, accounted for half of the 3,144 headlines selected by algorithms.The Duchess of Sussex and Donald Trump were rare topics of interest for both sets of editors.The findings underscore the problems with relying on automatic curators to do the work of human editors, even for services such as Apple News that try to use both in concert.Algorithmic editors can also fall prey to other issues, such as the “Scunthorpe problem” – a form of accidental censorship that sees stories blacklisted because of their similarity to obscenities, as with the four-letter word in the middle of the industrial town. In May, for instance, Twitter’s algorithmic filters barred Dominic Cummings from automatically appearing in news roundups because of his surname’s pornographic potential.However, the problems have not stopped publishers from embracing the cost savings automation can produce. Last month, Microsoft decided to replace all of the human editors who curate stories for the company’s MSN News service with algorithms that could do the same work.Less than a week later, however, the robot editors had embroiled the company in a race row after illustrating a story about the Little Mix singer Jade Thirlwall with a picture of her bandmate Leigh-Anne Pinnock, the only other mixed-race member of the group. The algorithms then attempted to post a story about their own error, forcing the few remaining human editors to intervene."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89821c796463265799d7a067237043a4cc39d068/0_0_689_413/master/689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dbc9ed7fc0b7aacf0c734bfc6842345","title":"facebook blocks bans users sharing guardian article showing aboriginal men in chains","story":"Social media site incorrectly removed historical photo on grounds of nudity, then for three days blocked and even banned users who posted link to articleFacebook has blocked and in some cases banned users who tried to share a  article about the site incorrectly blocking an image of Aboriginal men in chains.On Saturday,  Australia reported that Facebook had apologised for incorrectly preventing an Australian user from sharing the photo from the 1890s.The post was made in the context of the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, claiming there was no slavery in Australia, before he backed down on those comments a day later.The post was removed by Facebook and the man had his account restricted, with Facebook claiming the photo contained nudity and was in breach of the social media site’s community standards.The post was restored after  Australia asked Facebook whether the photo had been flagged in error. Facebook apologised to the user late on Friday and restored the post.A spokeswoman for Facebook said the photo was removed by the automated system in error.“We apologise for this mistake,” she said.However, dozens of  readers have since reported that when they tried to post a link to the article on their profiles they received message that the post violated the same community standards.The man who first posted the image to his profile was among those unable to share the news article.Several readers were even banned from posting on Facebook for up to 30 days for attempting to share the article.After further inquiries from  Australia Facebook appeared to allow the article to be posted on Monday afternoon.Facebook typically allows users to request a review of any takedowns. Between January and March it restored 613,000 pieces of content after 2.1m requests for review.Several people pointed out the disparity between Facebook quickly (and incorrectly) censoring content it believed to contain nudity and its reluctance to take action against Donald Trump’s inflammatory posts.The journalist and activist Cory Doctorow said on Twitter the incident showed Facebook could not moderate at scale, and that automated moderating was not evenly distributed, with some minority groups more likely to have their discussions censored.Doctorow argued Facebook should not be given additional duties in censoring content, as some have called for in recent weeks over Trump’s posts on Twitter and Facebook. Instead, he said, Facebook should be cut down to a “size, to a scale where communities can set and enforce norms”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c5853d565845ede314bd4f595daef0af3252db5/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=184d61115ae98e024018d92a3dc78ff5","title":"we rule ok englands independent island kingdoms","story":"Piel Island in Cumbria and Sealand off the coast of Essex are sovereign monarchies with their own laws, stamps … and enemiesIt isn’t commonly known that the UK has three royal families. You may have heard of a motley bunch called the Windsors, but how about King Steve and Queen Sheila of Piel Island?This 50-acre island off Barrow-in-Furness in north-west England has it all: a castle, a pub and a monarchy. Piel has been ruled peacefully for more than 500 years, with ine sovereignty automatically bestowed on whoever’s running the Ship Inn. Each year, a new Knight of the Realm is chosen. This title is not acquired, as some believe, by simply having a pint poured over your head and getting a round in. According to Queen Sheila, “myself, the king and a few princesses select whoever’s done something outstanding for our community. The last person we knighted rescued 10 people from drowning. One year it was Harry H Corbett of Steptoe and Son fame: he was a frequent visitor and created great treasure hunts for the kids.”Six miles off the SuffolkEssex coast lies Sealand, formerly Roughs Tower, one of many sea forts built during the second world war and abandoned. In 1966, it was “claimed” by former pirate radio operator Roy Bates. He declared his new home an independent principality, with himself as Prince Roy and his wife Princess Joan. Three nautical miles outside England’s legally controlled waters, Sealand was answerable to no laws except its own. Soon it had its own flag, postage stamps and currency, all bearing the image of Princess Joan’s head.Over the decades Sealand has faced a major fire and an attempted coup, after which a German lawyer and Sealand passport holder was convicted of treason and given a life sentence. (They pardoned him after seven weeks.) In 1987, in accordance with new international laws, Britain extended its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles, drawing Sealand back into British waters. In response, Prince Roy extended Sealand’s territory by the same distance. If Britain owns Sealand, it in turn now owns Felixstowe, Harwich and the nice parts of Clacton-on-Sea. An unspoken stalemate remains.Visitors wishing to meet Piel Island’s royals will have to wait until 2021, when ferries are expected to restart and its medieval castle and pub reopen. Sealand remains rather impenetrable, isolated in the North Sea, and can only be visited by direct invitation. Its monarchy, however, is less selective than Piel’s in bestowing titles on its subjects. For a modest £29.99, “official” documents signed by current reigning monarch Prince Regent Michael guarantee instant ennoblement as Lord, Lady, Baron or Baroness of Sealand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd9b89a871fc5d85c59b9f91c9f3544cb0c147a7/0_0_5920_3947/master/5920.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ec18196a79ca8402da0ac3639c1c714 880w","title":"the end of credits why doesnt netflix want us to watch them","story":"The end credits are an unsexy but important part of the experience – but streaming platforms seem to be interested only in getting us to the next piece of contentThe second that final spoonful goes in your mouth the waiter runs over, noisily clears the plates away and shoves a new menu under your nose, while insisting that you order the set menu immediately. That’s the experience we all have when watching films and TV on streaming platforms.The end credit sequence is an unsexy but still important part of the film-going experience. It can be a key moment of contemplation, to assess, absorb and reflect on everything you have just experienced. It can be a moment of musical resolve. It can be a place to see the countless hundreds of people who worked to create something from nothing (not just the famous ones). Or it can just be an excuse to look for crew members with funny names. But the current trend with virtually all the streaming services is to treat end credits as having the same artistic merit as a DFS Summer Sofa Sale ad. Our entertainment goes from being a work of art that could resonate for years afterwards to “content” that is to be guzzled as fast as possible from an endless bargain bucket.I understand why the feature was introduced, especially in the age of the multi-episodic binge watch. And I have no problem with a lot of people wanting to skip credits – it was ever thus with home viewing. But I do have a problem with having to “opt-in” to watch something that is often an integral piece of a complete artistic vision.I’m pretty sure it was the time I watched Schindler’s List on Netflix that pushed me over the edge. If ever there was a movie where the credits were an integral part of the experience this was it. However, the second after Steven Spielberg’s name came up, the screen was shrunk to the size of a postage stamp and a massive advert appeared telling you to watch something else. Worse still, if you didn’t click the correct button within 10 seconds, you could wave bye bye to contemplating the emotional complexity of the past three hours (and John William’s magnificent, Oscar-winning musical conclusion) and say hello to whichever trailer Netflix’s algorithm had decided you would want to gorge on.The lights were off in my flat – and I had foolishly logged in through my PlayStation and its fiendishly unorthodox series of buttons. I stumbled around desperately trying to find the controller before the ticking clock of doom would hit zero. I got there with a second to spare – success – and then managed to press the wrong button – disaster – resulting in immediate expulsion from the cinematic world I had been so fully immersed in.Some services have added options to turn these features off but they are usually hidden away and rarely fully implemented. And the problem isn’t unique to any one provider they are all as bad as each other. BBC iPlayer destroyed the excellently curated unique end music on every episode of Devs by cutting to the next episode after 10 seconds.But that isn’t my only reason for despising this trend. I write music for movies and TV, and I know, that from a compositional point of view, the soundtrack for the end credits can be an incredibly important part of the musical arc you and the director may have tried to create over a whole film. I’ve just scored a new movie, Enola Holmes, that will air on Netflix this year. That end credit music is the culmination of Enola’s theme I have spent the previous two hours working towards it. Not that most viewers will experience that resolution.I don’t mind that most people aren’t interested – trust me, you would never become a film composer if you were – but I do mind that at the one point where you should really be contemplating and reflecting on the journey you have just been through, you are instead forced into finding the remote or face being pushed somewhere totally different within seconds.Companies such as Netflix, Amazon and even the BBC may publicly laud their commitment to the arts but, to film-makers and the creative community, the way they are presenting that work tells a completely different story. I find it insulting as both a consumer and a creator.There is some hope. The saviour of the end credits sequence may be the most unlikely: Marvel Studios. Through its regular use of post-credit dramatic scenes, it has become their unlikely protector. It is a habit much imitated in blockbuster cinema – but it’s yet to be copied by the streaming giants.One Seattle-based Netflix customer, Mark Boszko, was so fed up with the situation he organised a petition to pressure the company into allowing people to watch the credits without interruption. He hasn’t had much success yet, but I hope he soon does. Otherwise that potentially powerful moment of emotional contemplation and reflection may soon be lost for ever thanks to a cabal of companies whose only interest is to maximise time in your eyeballs and not in your hearts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb276678917e72d62c2868a2083493e42f83acf7/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c0de62e5f9ff93f16bc261961c34353","title":"joe biden race reforms democrat seizes moment","story":"Democratic candidate appears emboldened by the changed political landscape, embracing a far more ambitious reform agenda than he did when entered the race for presidentIn the weeks since George Floyd died under the knee of a white police officer America’s institutions – from boardrooms and newsrooms to locker rooms and classrooms – are publicly addressing systematic discrimination and demanding reforms.With a reckoning over race compounded by a pandemic and an economic collapse, Donald Trump and his would-be Democratic opponent Joe Biden are charting starkly different courses for the nation that could determine which one of them wins the White House in November.But in tone, tenor and leadership style, it is Biden who currently appears well positioned to harness this political moment.Biden has sought to cast himself as a champion of racial equality, encouraging peaceful protest and vowing to “heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country”.“This is a battle for the soul of America,” he said at an economic roundtable in Philadelphia last week. “Who are we? What do we want to be? How do we see ourselves? What do we think we should be? Character is on the ballot here.”As public attitudes shift quickly on race, Biden appears emboldened by the changed political landscape, embracing a far more ambitious reform agenda than he entered the race for president. By contrast, Trump, with his hostility to the protesters and resistance to their demands for reform, has found himself on the wrong side of the American public at a particularly perilous moment for his presidency and his re-election prospects.“People are finally seeing through the fog that has blinded them for too long,” said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist based in South Carolina. “They are realizing that the system is broken and Donald Trump is not going to fix it.”Public opinion on race has been moving leftward since the Black Lives Matter movement emerged in the wake of Trayvon Martin’s death in 2012. White Democrats in particular have become increasingly more concerned about issues of racial inequality, even registering to the left of African Americans voters.But the recent shifts represent a sea change so sudden and deep that pollsters were left grasping for parallels.Support for Black Lives Matter has also jumped, according to Civiqs Polling, that found voters from across the ideological and demographic spectrum embrace the movement.“This is big,” tweeted Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who said he hadn’t seen anything like it in more than three decades of polling. “This is ‘Beatles on Ed Sullivan’ big.”Ample research has found race and identity were critical to Trump’s victory in 2016.During the campaign, he brazenly stoked white racial grievance that had been building since the election of the nation’s first black president, promising to restore America’s past glory and “Make America Great Again”. As president, Trump said there were “good people on both sides” of a deadly white supremacist rally. He disparaged four congresswomen of color with a racist taunt. And recently, he has responded to the most significant racial upheaval in a generation by describing protesters as “thugs” and “terrorists”, threatening to unleash the army to quell demonstrations and defending military bases named after Confederate leaders.In response to the protests, Trump has declared himself the “president of law and order”, appealing to a base that is predominantly white and conservative. This week he held a roundtable with law enforcement officials in Dallas, where he dismissed police brutality as the misconduct of a few “bad apples” and warned that “falsely labeling tens of millions of decent Americans as racists or bigots” would not improve race relations.Some observers have compared Trumps approach to Richard Nixon’s 1968 election strategy, when he ran as the law-and-order candidate after a summer of riots – and won.But there is reason to believe 2020 may be different from 2016 and 1968, said Michael Tesler, a political scientist at the University of California at Irvine and author of Post-Racial or Most Racial? Race and Politics in the Obama Era.While “law and order” can be a powerful message in the midst of national upheaval, Tesler said, it’s a much harder case to make as an incumbent whose governing style over the last three and a half years has contributed to that chaos.“The country views Trump as a racial arsonist at a time when racial reconciliation is needed,” he wrote in an email.And far from boosting Trump in November, the protests are likely to mobilize and energize Democrats, says Daniel Gillion, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of The Loud Minority: Why Protests Matter in American Democracy.Throughout modern American history, protests have not only succeeded in influencing public policy but impacted electoral outcomes for the party ideologically aligned with their cause, according to Gillion.His research found African American turnout in 2016 was higher in cities that saw Black Lives Matter protests, even as it declined elsewhere. But the effect is geographically concentrated and the protests were limited.“Now that protests are happening in everyone’s backyard it’s likely there will be a snowballing effect,” he said. “And based on what I’ve found, one can only expect that Democrats are going to be more mobilized to vote in November because of what’s taking place.”Heather McGhee, co-chair of the political advocacy group color of change, said the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis caused by efforts to control it, which have disproportionately impacted African American communities, “primed” the nation for this tectonic shift in attitudes on racism in America.“It became very clear once the pandemic is that we were all suffering from the same storm, but we weren’t all in the same boat,” said McGhee.McGhee described Biden as a “weather vane” for the Democratic party.During the primary, he offered himself as a pragmatist who once assured donors that under his administration “nothing would fundamentally change”. But that was when Democrats’ top concern was ousting Trump. Now, as inequalities in public health, the economy and race are laid bare, Biden’s sudden desire for systemic change is telling.“The band-aid has been ripped off,” Biden said recently during a virtual appearance, explaining that more Americans are connecting the dots and exposed deep-rooted social ills. “The scar is apparent and I think they’re ready to do something about it. I think they’re ready to see some real institutional change.”A majority of Americans, including among Republicans, agree some changes to policing are needed. But growing calls from activists to “defund the police” has little support.Biden, who faced criticism during the primary over his legislative record on criminal justice and race, has embraced an overhaul of policing.Though he and Democratic leaders in Congress have flatly rejected growing calls to “defund the police” it has not stopped Trump and his Republican allies from seizing on the issue in an effort to drive a wedge between activists and moderate Democrats.Trump’s electoral strategy hinges on his ability to drive up turnout among his base of support, which is predominantly white, older, less educated and conservative. While their share of the electorate is shrinking, this cohort holds outsized influence in the handful of states that will likely determine the election.Biden’s task is to stitch together a coalition that is increasingly multicultural, young, educated and liberal. Diverse battleground states like Arizona, Georgia and Texas, once bastions of conservatism, are now competitive.Biden won the primary on the strength of his support among African Americans, but he struggled to appeal to the young voters now leading the protests, said Steve Phillips, host of Democracy in Color with Steve Phillips and the author of the book Brown Is the New White. “There’s a bigger risk of failing to inspire and galvanize younger voters and people of color than there is alienating moderate voters,” he said.Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who advised Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016, said Biden must “treat black voters like swing voters”.Choosing a black woman as his running mate would be one way of emphasizing black voters importance to the Democratic party.“History is telling us that in this moment we need to lift the voices of black Americans,” she said, “and especially the voices of black women”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab0502bc37fe2e92bea29e51b1a9807f145f9df9/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d98cc6e5dd26e7a2ed0e254d3823f9ae","title":"germany and france reopen borders as europe emerges from lockdown","story":"Spain to reopen borders on 21 June but other countries are adopting more targeted approachFrance and Germany became the latest European countries to reopen their borders as the continent emerges from its three-month Covid-19 lockdown.Speaking on Sunday evening, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said the country’s Schengen borders would be open from Monday and its non-EU borders from 1 July.He said that while France could be proud of its response to the pandemic, it needed to reflect on the crisis.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.“This challenge has also revealed weaknesses, fragilities, our dependence on other continents to procure certain products, our cumbersome organisation, our social and territorial inequalities,” he said. “I would like us to learn all the lessons from what we have been through.”Germany also opened its borders to fellow European travellers, but the government – which helped fly 240,000 people home as the pandemic grew exponentially – warned people to be careful as they planned their summer holidays.“My appeal to all those who travel: enjoy your summer vacation but enjoy it with caution and responsibility,” said the foreign minister, Heiko Maas. “Over the summer holidays, we want to make it as difficult as possible for the virus to spread again in Europe.”The appeal came as 10,900 German tourists began arriving in the Balearic islands as part of a pilot scheme to help Spain reactivate its crucial tourist industry.On Sunday, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, announced the country would reopen its borders to visitors from the EU and the Schengen area from Sunday 21 June.At the request of the Portuguese government, the land border with Spain will not open until 1 July, when Spain will open its border to travellers from other countries.Sánchez also called for caution in his televised address. “As you know, the threat of the pandemic remains present,” he said. “The pandemic isn’t over – a quick look at what’s happening right now in North America and South America show us that it isn’t.”Italy – one of the European countries hardest hit by the pandemic – reopened its borders on 3 June, but others are adopting a more targeted approach.Greece’s two main airports - in Athens and Thessaloniki – reopened to arrivals on Monday and the country plans to reopen its borders to the majority of European tourists, as well as those from certain other parts of the world, including Australia, Japan and New Zealand.However, anyone from a region particularly badly hit by the virus will have to undergo mandatory tests and spend their first night on Greek soil in a designated hotel. These include the Paris region, Madrid and Italy’s northern Lombardy region, among others.Switzerland, a non-EU member, opened its borders to all 27 countries, plus the UK, Norway and Liechenstein, but said arrivals from Sweden will have to take a temperature test due to its high rate of new infections.Norway is keeping its border closed with Sweden, whose virus strategy avoided a lockdown but produced a relatively high per capita death rate.On Tuesday, Austria – which has already opened its borders to most of its neighbours – will drop travel restrictions on a total of 31 countries, but has excluded Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK.The Czech Republic is also allowing free travel with a number of European countries from Monday, but restrictions are still in place with those deemed a risk due to their levels of coronavirus infections.Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia and Slovenia have also already begun to lift restrictions for foreigners entering their countries but excluded those from nations they deem as not safe – in many cases that list includes Sweden and the UK.Britain, which left the EU in January but remains closely aligned with the bloc until the end of this year, only last week imposed a 14-day quarantine requirement for most arrivals, horrifying its tourism and aviation industries.As a result, France is asking people coming from Britain to self-quarantine for two weeks and several other nations are not even letting British tourists come in during the first wave of reopenings. France will also ask visitors from Spain to self-quarantine.With flights only gradually picking up, nervousness about fresh outbreaks abroad, uncertainty about social distancing at tourist venues and many people facing record unemployment or pay cuts, many Europeans may choose to stay home or explore their own countries.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and her Austrian counterpart, Sebastian Kurz, are both planning to holiday in their homelands this year.“If you want to be really safe, the recommendation is still a vacation in Austria,” the country’s foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, told ORF television. He reminded people of the scramble in March to bring home thousands of tourists as borders slammed shut.“In Austria, you know that you don’t have to cross a border if you want to get home, and you know the infrastructure and the health system well.”The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a9d8469508bd7d5f2c7faf6197bf32a4df0fbe5/0_119_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=82a5919741901ae9dab1f9ced4c07022","title":"married people report higher anxiety levels during lockdown","story":"Survey finds people married or in civil partnerships feeling more anxious than single peopleMarried people and those in civil partnerships have reported the highest rise in anxiety levels during lockdown, according to a study by the Office of National Statistics.The study noted that married iniduals were more likely to be balancing homeschooling alongside other commitments, with one in four people homeschooling during the pandemic, compared with approximately one in 10 who are single, separated or orced.It also noted that feeling lonely was the factor most strongly associated with reporting high anxiety – people who “often or always” felt lonely were almost five times more likely to report higher levels of anxiety than those who said they “never” felt lonely.Those aged 75 and over were almost twice as likely as those aged 16 to 24to report high levels of anxiety during lockdown, reversing trends prior to lockdown.In April the UK government set out these five tests it said had to be met before they would consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:For people reporting high anxiety during the pandemic, more than one in five said that their work had been affected because they were finding working from home difficult.“Another marked change is in those aged 65 years or older.

These newborns are not in the nursery of a maternity hospital, they are lined up side by side in two large reception rooms of the improbably named Hotel Venice on the outskirts of Kyiv, protected by outer walls and barbed wire.\u0026nbspThey are the children of foreign couples born to Ukrainian surrogate mothers at the Kyiv-based BioTexCom Centre for Human Reproduction, the largest surrogacy clinic in the world. They’re stranded in the hotel because their biological parents have not been able to travel in or out of Ukraine since borders closed in March because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Anxious parents check on the children they have not yet met via video calls, and others have sent audio recordings of their voices to soothe the children. BioTexCom released video footage from the hotel in mid-May to highlight the heartbreaking dilemma for parents and to lobby for an easing of border closures.The babies’ plight made headlines around the world,\u0026nbspbut a month on, some 50 babies remain in the hotel and the saga is casting a harsh spotlight on the ethics and scale of the booming commercial child-bearing industry in Ukraine.Mykola Kuleba, Ukraine’s ombudsman for children, has now said reforming a system he described as a violation of children’s rights was not enough and that surrogacy services for foreign couples in Ukraine should be banned.In a cash-strapped economy however, where the average wage is £300 a month and the war with Russia and its proxies continues, many impoverished women, especially in small towns and rural areas, are still lining up to carry babies for money, even if they are paying a heavy health and psychological price, as campaigners believe.In Vinnytsia, a city south-west of Kyiv, Liudmyla is still waiting to receive the balance of her fee for giving birth to a baby girl for a German couple in February. She regularly texts her surrogacy agency (not BioTexCom), which she says owes her €6,000. “They keep telling me they can’t send the entire sum because of the lockdown,” she says.\u0026nbspThough Liudmyla, 39, had an embryo transfer in Kyiv and spent most of her pregnancy in Vinnytsia, the agency asked her to travel to Poland to give birth so that the baby could be registered there. Hospital personnel were not aware that Liudmyla was a surrogate mother because commercial surrogacy is banned in Poland, as it is in most of Europe.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I didn’t want to give her away, I was crying,” Liudmyla recalls. She says that after two days of caring for the infant in the maternity ward, letting her go was a wrench. “But I knew what it was all about.”\u0026nbspA shop assistant and a single mother, Luidmyla struggled for years to find a home for herself and her own three children that would be better than the one room in a hostel that they had. So in 2017 she went to a surrogacy clinic, and with the money she was able to take out a mortgage on an apartment. Even though she was placed in an intensive care unit as a result of complications in the pregnancy, Liudmyla decided to have a second surrogate baby to pay back most of the loan for the flat.\u0026nbspThere are no official statistics, but it is estimated that several thousand children are born to surrogate mothers in Ukraine each year.\u0026nbspEighty per cent of these babies are for foreign couples, who choose Ukraine because the process is legal and cheap.\u0026nbspSergii Antonov, a fertility lawyer, says Ukrainian surrogate agencies occasionally organise for the babies to be born abroad because this can make the birth registration process easier.The price of a surrogacy package in Ukraine starts from £25,000, with the surrogate mother receiving at least £10,000. Intended parents are generally required to be married heterosexual couples and to have proof of their infertility diagnosis. Surrogacy clinics and agencies place their ads in newspapers, on public transport or in social media groups.Tetiana Shulzhynska, 38, writes to such groups, trying to persuade women to stay away from surrogacy because she thinks some of them end up paying with their health or even their lives. “In a contract, they protect only babies, they don’t care about us,” she says, sitting on a bed in her tiny wooden house in Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine.\u0026nbspShulzhynska, a mother of two who used to work as a trolley bus conductor, went to a surrogacy clinic in 2013 because she desperately needed to pay back a bank loan. She was so broke that the clinic sent her money to buy the ticket to Kyiv.She agreed to carry a baby for an Italian couple, and within two months it turned out she had four living embryos in her womb. The biological family decided to keep only one and the rest were removed surgically. In May 2014 Shulzhynska gave birth to a baby girl, which she gave away to the parents. She received a fee of €9,000.\u0026nbspSeven months later she went to a hospital with severe stomach pain. Doctors diagnosed cervical cancer. It took her almost a year to raise money for surgery. Shulzhynska suspects the cancer was caused by her surrogacy, although there is no proof of this.\u0026nbspShe has recently ordered crutches because her doctors plan to amputate her left leg, which is now affected by the spreading cancer.In 2015, Shulzhynska filed a complaint against BioTexCom alleging damage caused to her health, which led to a criminal investigation that is ongoing.Yuriy Kovalchuk, a former state prosecutor whose office oversaw a series of criminal investigations into BioTexCom in 2018 and 2019, says at least three other women went to law enforcement after having their wombs removed following surrogate pregnancies organised by the company.He says other investigations involved allegations of fraud and even a human trafficking inquiry in 2016, after an Italian couple discovered in 2011 that the children they had taken home were not genetically related to them. Kovalchuk was removed from his post last year and believes the investigations into BioTexCom have stalled as a result. He wrote to the ombudsman’s office in May outlining his concerns about the clinic.At Hotel Venice, Albert Tochilovsky, the owner of BioTexCom, does not deny there were mix-ups with embryos during surrogacy procedures in 2011 that led to the human trafficking investigation.He blames the error on a lack of experience when the clinic was only a year old, and says: “I don’t think it was only us who used to make mistakes here. If someone starts checking DNA, there will be a lot of scandals.” \u0026nbspHe claims that in at least three cases parents rejected surrogate babies after they were born with health problems. The best-known of them is the case of Bridget, the daughter of an American couple, who was born in 2016 and now lives in an orphanage in Zaporizhia, in eastern Ukraine. “It was a tragedy for us,” Tochilovsky says.\u0026nbspThe company’s website advertises “the best surrogate mothers” and Tochilovsky denies mistreatment of any women or any fraud at his clinic. He dismisses Shulzhynska’s cancer claims as “nonsense” and says the firm gives contractual protection to surrogate mothers.Surrogate mothers are self-organising on social media, where they share advice and warnings about surrogacy agencies. Svitlana Sokolova, a former surrogate mother and now an activist at the NGO Strength of Mothers, which helps surrogates, says she started receiving more complaints about alleged mistreatment during the Covid lockdown. One group of women said their contract obliged them to keep having embryos implanted in their wombs for a year until they got pregnant. “Through this contract, the women became a kind of property,” she says.Maryna Lehenka, a lawyer at La Strada Ukraine, says the charity’s hotline gets around 100 calls a year from surrogate mothers complaining about the stress they experience after giving away babies or problems caused by the hormones they took to increase the chances of pregnancy. She recalls a case when a woman went into hiding in a village because she did not want to give away a surrogate baby. Lehenka agrees with the ombudsman that commercial surrogacy should be banned in Ukraine. Sokolova, who co-owns a surrogacy agency, argues instead for a proper legal framework that would protect the surrogates. “Otherwise, it will just go underground.”Despite pressure for regulation of the surrogacy business – there are several draft laws before parliament – experts and insiders doubt major legal changes will be made anytime soon to curb the baby business. Tochilovsky says that if commercial surrogacy became illegal, his clinic would just refocus on embryo donation.\u0026nbsp“The world’s future is in biotechnology, and most of the money will come into biotechnologies,” he says.Olga, 26, is going to have her second set of surrogate twin boys for a Chinese couple later this month. To give birth, she came to Kyiv from a town in north-east Ukraine along with her young son and husband, and was placed by the agency in a new flat within walking distance of the maternity hospital. Olga says she is feeling fine and she meets sometimes with three other pregnant surrogate mothers living nearby. Using the $17,000 (£13,500) she will get for the babies, Olga wants to open a coffee shop or a flower boutique back home. “I didn’t kill, I didn’t steal, I made this money in an honest way,” she says.

As we bring the incidence and the transmission rate down, depending on the setting, it’s something that can be looked at. We are still going to make sure that all of the policy judgments that we rightly as politicians take and are accountable for are underpinned by the science.And later he said:The science isn’t set in stone. It is constantly evolving. So it is fluid. That’s why we need to constantly monitor it.When Edward Argar, the health minister, answered a Commons urgent question on this earlier, many Tory MPs called for the two-metre rule to be relaxed, with some saying that decision should be taken immediately.We do want to get to the bottom of that, we’ve commissioned more research on it. I think you’d agree that needs to be handled very sensitively but we are making sure we get to the bottom of it and that we’ve got a clear view before we advise the public ...We want to make sure we’ve got a clearer understanding so we can communicate it with practical advice for those involved, precisely because it is a very sensitive issue and we want to give clear and reassuring guidance and not to have different people saying different things.We will release as much evidence as we can as soon as we practically can.YouGov has published some fresh polling this afternoon. It suggests that Sir Keir Starmer has drawn level with Boris Johnson on who would make the best prime minister.But the Conservatives still have a significant lead over Labour in voting intention, the poll suggests.Secondary schools in England have been told they can invite pupils in for one face-to-face meeting ahead of the summer holidays to check on well-being and progress since lockdown.The new guidance from the Department for Education comes as pupils in years 10 and 12 who are preparing to sit GCSEs and A-levels next summer begin to return to school this week for limited contact.The DfE has also confirmed that primary schools can use flexibility to admit more children, in addition to the year groups already allowed back to school, if they have capacity to do so.The government is under pressure to get more children back into school before the summer holidays amid growing evidence of patchy provision of lessons at home and fears that the attainment gap will widen.Education secretary Gavin Williamson said: “I want to make sure as many pupils as possible can get back into the classroom and be reunited with their friends and teachers before summer, to support their wellbeing and education.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the idea of a “check-in” session but added: “These changes do not make up for the lack of a long-term, strategic plan for education for the coming months.”Q: When the PM says you need to get infection rates down before the two-metre rule can be relaxed, what does he mean?Raab says two metres will applies for now. The PM has launched a review. The government will say more than, he says.Q: What assurances can you give to people in the hospital sector that they will be able to reopen?Raab says 4 July was always the earliest possible date for reopening. It has to be done in safest possible way, he says.Q: In April you said it would not be business as usual with China after coronavirus. How strongly do you take warnings about the danger China could do to the UK economy?Raab says he thinks his comment may have been over-interpreted. He says it is not necessarily business as usual with any country.He says they want a balanced approach to China.Q: When will we see the results of the Huawei review?Raab says that will be when the full data is back.Back in the Commons, Priti Patel has been paying tribute to Patrick Hutchinson, the Black Lives Matter demonstrator who was photographed carrying a counter-protester to safety during Saturday’s protests in London.I think ... all members of the house will join me in saying he is the very best of Britain. Our country needs more people like him and his actions this weekend spoke volumes and I pay tribute to him and the way in which he conducted himself and the way in which he stepped in.Hutchinson spoke to Channel 4 news last night and his comments are worth a read.Q: Are you taking less notice of the science?Raab says the science is evolving.Science and medical experts will continue to attend the press conferences, he says.But he says other experts will be represented too.Q: Your colleague Nusrat Ghani said today that you don’t need any more BME reviews. You just need to implement what has been recommended already.Raab says the commission is being set up to set a new direction.But he stressed that a lot of progress has already been made.He says this commission will come up with actual policies.Q: Aren’t you just kicking the can down the road?Raab says the government is already following up on things like the Lammy review. (See 1.28pm.)And he says there is some encouraging Ipsos MORI polling out on this today.Q: Do you accept that changing the two-metre rule involves a trade-off between safety and business?Raab says there is nothing absolute about two metres. And he says the scientific evidence is constantly evolvingQ: Do you agree that the way British Airways is treating its workers is a disgrace?Raab says firms are going through a very difficult time. He would urge them to save as many jobs as possible.Q: What help is the government offering?Raab says it has offered a lot of help already. He says his department, the Foreign Office, spent £75m on a charter flight regime that helped airlines.Q: But what are you doing for British Airways?Raab says the chancellor is looking at all vulnerable sectors.Raab says he does not accept this is just another review. He says the government is making progress on the recommendations from past reviews.Q: But there are leaks from the report explaining why BAME people are dying more frequently from coronavirus?Raab says it is a sensitive topic. When the government can release further information, it will do so.Q: What will the government do to help key workers with childcare over the summer? The normal options - summer camps, grandparents and holidays abroad - aren’t available?Raab says that is a good question. But he says the government will fund summer activities.Raab is now taking the first question, from Olly in Newcastle.Q: When will the alert level fall to one, or close to one?Raab says it is hard to say. They are trying to push it down. But the alert level is not up to politicians, he says.And here is the slide with the death figures.Raab is now presenting the slides.Here are the figures for tests and news cases.Raab says the government is monitoring the impact of its changes carefully. There is a risk of a second spike, he says.He says the government will not move to the next stage before 4 July.Nick Thomas-Symonds says that we need to see “deeds not words” and that, by launching an inquiry into racism and inequality and failing to act now, “the prime minister just isn’t offering the leadership required”. Priti Patel responds that the Black Lives Matter movement and the points they have been making are “important and essential”.She says the aim of the commission is to set out a “positive agenda for change” and that all MPs should welcome that.Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is taking the UK government press conference.He summarises the latest moves to ease the lockdown coming into force in England. These are modest and careful steps, he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa8f952ea7bbc5bb58ce2825b15dbffe5ba0f5a/0_0_12000_7204/master/12000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e97e3f288efc213f8e4d19d5fcb0218","title":"podcasting to blogging five tips to help marginalised voices find their platform","story":"In a world where everyone has an opinion, how do you make sure your views see the limelight, especially when it seems that no one is listening? Here, three people who found their voices explain how you can do itIt should, these days, be easier than ever to make a point in public. If you want to tell your story there are places to blog and host videos, there is social media to help you find an audience, and free software and ever cheaper hardware to get you online.But in practice, not everyone finds it easy to push their ideas into a public space. So where do you begin, particularly if you feel as if you’re on the margins? As part of Levi’s Your Voice. Your Way campaign,  Labs talked to three young people who, driven by a burning desire to be heard, found their voices through blogging, podcasts and zines.This is their advice to others who are bubbling with ideas and opinions, who know they have something valuable to say, but may feel unchampioned or underestimated. These are the first steps to getting your voice heard ...1. Stay true to yourselfYou might admire a particular columnist or an influencer, but the world doesn’t need an exact copy of someone else. The world needs you.“I tried lots of voices on for size, but they weren’t really me,” says Jessica Riches, a social media and content specialist. She found her real voice and honed her social media skills during the student protests of 2010 when she became the clearest online voice of the group who occupied University College London in protest at increases in fees.“Politics was where I found myself,” she says. “I was able to learn and explore that side of myself and I found a community of people.”For Raifa Rafiq, a shared interest in books led her to create the Mostly Lit podcast with her friend Alex Reads. “The response we got was phenomenal,” she says of the podcast, which ran for four years, won awards and partnered with Waterstones. “We did something we enjoyed and ended up putting a different face on culture and arts criticism: you don’t have to be an old white man or a middle class white woman to love books or to talk about them.”2. Consider your platform carefullyWho do you want to reach and what are you trying to say? Both of these questions will have an effect on where and how you publish your work. “In terms of social media, this is key,” says Riches. “If you are telling a story that is text based, about news or opinion, then head to Twitter. If you want to draw people in with visuals, use Instagram. This sounds really obvious, but the mistake people often make at the beginning is over-committing. Pick the most appropriate platform and start there, that way you won’t end up disappointing yourself. You can always expand later.”Kirsty Fife has published her work on blogs and also created physical fanzines. “I started out blogging, I ran a fat-fashion blog, Fatty Unbound,” she says. “Blogging did create a space that wasn’t there at the time.” Digitally, she honed her writing and found a community, but decided to begin putting out fanzines when her work became more personal.3. Start creating“Think about what you engage with, what stops your thumb in its endless scroll,” says Riches. “Then think about what’s missing. Write down – privately – what you want your content principles to be. What topics are you going to cover, what are your boundaries? What will you enjoy creating? It sounds limiting, but it’s very freeing it stops you trying to talk about everything at once.”Creating a fanzine, says Fife: “Is still very lo-fi. It’s a Sharpie, sketchbooks, pieces of paper. Although these days I scan everything into my computer and create PDFs to print and distribute. I don’t want any more incidents with things getting stuck in work photocopiers.”The DIY approach has also worked for Rafiq, whose new podcast This Thing Changed My Life launched this month. “Buy equipment and teach yourself,” she says. “Some editing software is free and it might seem scary, but it’s not. YouTube taught me everything, and I started recording in a day. It’s saved me so much time and money.”4. Believe in yourselfThe biggest barriers, however, often aren’t the practical ones. Why, you might think, would anyone want to hear from you?“It’s hard to put something out into the world,” says Fife. “I used to think that anything I made had to be perfectly finished and polished. It will never be perfect, so push through those feelings of anxiety. Put whatever you can out there, don’t wait for validation to start.”“There will always be someone for whom your work is meaningful.”5. Build your communityFife, Rafiq and Riches all agree they have found communities through their creative work. “I found both friends and collaborators,” says Fife.But it’s worth remembering that an audience won’t appear overnight. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” says Riches. “And you need to put the work in. Start where you feel comfortable, ask your close friends to like what you’re doing, then expand to other friends. Build.”Riches also points out that finding a community and finding an audience are very closely linked. “Don’t forget that social media is supposed to be social,” she says. “Support other people in your field. Collaborate. Share. Showcase others and make connections.”Before starting to produce her own, Fife bought zines created by others. She recommends looking at zine distros – places that sell and distribute a number of different fanzines. “I go to Pen Fight Distro, Synchronise Witches Press and Vampire Hag. There will be a voice you enjoy out there.”Rafiq proved there was an audience for her work that had been ignored or discounted by much of the culture industry. “Young people do love the arts,” she says. “Arts criticism isn’t just an endeavour for Oxbridge grads. You can be from the inner city, you can be BAME and want this.”The effort is worth it, Fife says. “I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me over the years because they listened to my voice. I don’t have a professional background in writing, art or design, but I made things that meant something to others.”Use Your Voice ...At the heart of the Your Voice.

Don’t even think about it and just accept that it will be mixed. Photograph: Frank MillerThe  In the weeks ahead, Irish people will be holidaying at home in greater numbers than at any point since the 1970s when shorts were short and hair was permed. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the shutting of borders and the grounding of virtually all flights in and out of Ireland, people with plans to travel overseas have had to look closer to home. With that in mind we thought it might be useful to try and conjure up some useful tips for holidaying at home for those people who might not have done it in decades.1. Why does it always rain on me?: Irish people tend to be just a little obsessed by the weather. We talk about it with enthusiasm and flair and worry about it endlessly. Who amongst us hasn’t spent hours on a grey summer’s day staring at impenetrable clouds wondering if that is a break in the gloom we can see and a sliver of blue sky far, far away. Bad weather and the fear of it is one of the main reasons we started leaving this country in our droves in the 1980s and 1990s when overseas travel became the norm rather than the exception. But we need to recalibrate our national psyche and change our mindset this year if we are to get the best out of whatever the gods throw at us. We need to be more like the Germans and the French and the Americans who come here and love the weather.So, don’t waste your holiday and the run-up praying for good weather. Don’t even think about it and just accept that it will be mixed. It won’t be horrendous, there are not that that many days in the summer when it rains non-stop, but nor will it be amazing. Whatever it is you will still be able to make the best of it.2. Appy talk: Staying with the weather, the days of staring at the sky wondering if the end is nigh for the rain have long since been confined to the dustbin of history. The weather app on your phone will be your friend this summer. It will give you real-time hour by hour information on the weather wherever you are in the country. Treat it like your bible. If it tells you that between 2pm and 4pm, the sun will shine or at least the clouds will part briefly, plan your time at the beach or in the great outdoors around that. If your phone tells you it will be nicer in the morning than in the evening, get up earlier and if it is due to be nicer in the evening than in the morning allowing yourself a lie in. And yes, we do appreciate that this makes it sound very much like we are obsessing about the weather. Old habits and all that.3. Wet, wet wet: When Pricewatch were a lad, beach days were all about weirdly tight and uncomfortable nylon action mad speedos and luridly coloured windbreakers to shield our sandwiches from the savage bite of the swirling sands. It doesn’t have to be like that and you can have a day of fun at the beach and in the water without wishing you were far away. Will the water be lovely and warm? Probably not. Will you spend hours playing in the sea? Not without getting hypothermia. Is a bracing dip in the wild Atlantic waves a wonderfully invigorating way to spend a bitesize portions of your summer? It absolutely is. And Ireland has come a long way since the 70s. Today we have wet suits. You can pick up cheap ones in supermarkets – we understand that Aldi will be selling them in the weeks ahead – and in dedicated outdoorsy shops. While spending €300 on four for an average sized family may seem like a lot, if they allow you to defy the weather gods and frolic in the waves for hours over the course of a fortnight’s holiday it will be money well spent.4. Indoor amusements: Before you leave do all the research you need into the indoor fun you can have wherever you are going. While the indoor options are somewhat limited this year for obvious reasons, there are things you will be able to do if you have to deal with a miserable day. There will be museums, libraries and heritage centres to visit. There might even be the odd play centre open too. The trick is to work out your options before you leave home so you can have a few things to hand when you wake up to sheets of rain hammering the roof of your caravan or hotel room. By being a bit organised in the days before you leave you will help you to avoid the “Jaysus, what on earth are we going to do now,” moment.5. Play schools: Don’t just pack the car with clothes and beachy stuff. Bring board games, jig saws and playing cards. If you were on holidays overseas you would most likely not be watching the telly of an evening so there is absolutely no reason to do so while on holidays at home. If you have children over eight and have yet to teach them the joys of poker, Blackjack or 25, then now is the time. They will thank you for it when they are older and winning money off their friends at late night poker schools or taking the bank to the cleaners in Vegas.6. Streams of gold: Okay, so, we know we said that a summer holiday was no time to be watching the television, but that does not mean you have to spend your staycation living like an Amish. Decide on maybe 10 movies that you would be happy to watch over the course of your holiday. Bring a laptop or tablet, hook it up to the TV wherever you are staying and then watch them at your leisure. You might want to download them if you are concerned that the quality of the broadband wherever you end up is not up to scratch. Carefully chosen movies are better than mindlessly watching repeats of Reeling in the Years. And we love Reeling in the years.7. Make rules: There is absolutely no point in banning children from using their devices while they are on their holiday, particularly if you are not prepared to live under the same rules. But do set limits on how and when devices can be used. And then stick to them. This is good for both adults and for children. Just because you are on holiday at home does not mean that you have to be checking your phone every five minutes or answering work emails. There will be times while you are on leave that you might not feel like you are on leave given the familiarity of the surroundings but your are, so take the time off.8. Drive: There was nothing that would fill the child Pricewatch’s heart with dread more than an adult uttering the phrase “Let’s go for a drive”. In this scenario, the adults would sit in the front of the car – usually chain smoking with the window’s rolled up against the rain – while the children would rattle around the back with not so much as a single seat belt between them. It was as foul smelling as it was boring. However, we have it on very good account from a colleague who routinely goes on summer holidays in Ireland that drives are fun things to do with children. “Just never describe it to them as a ‘drive’,” this colleague warned us. “It’s a trip to some alluring destination, a mysterious beach, the best ice cream parlour in the west.” That sounds like a fine idea to us.9. Eat: Take advantage of where you are by exploring all the best food the region has to offer. It might be something simple like new potatoes or strawberries bought off the side of the road in Wexford or lobster pushed straight from the coastal waters off the coast of Sligo. The key thing is to treat yourself this year and, if you can, spend more than you might while at home. You are on holiday at home but that does not mean you have to shop in Aldi or Lidl. By eating the nicest of food you can find from local suppliers you will not only be rewarding yourself, you will be making life a little bit easier for local retailers and food producers who have been absolutely hammered by the pandemic. And while we are on the topic of food, make picnics and include crisps in every sandwich. It is cheap and it is fun.10. Wear sunblock: The routine for a sun holiday tends to involve lathering everyone in sun cream before the day gets going. But we tend to be a bit more relaxed about it when holidaying at home for obvious reasons. But the sun that burns us when we are on a beach on the Costa Brave is the same sun that can burn us while we are on a beach in Connemara. And we have said this before and we will say it again, there is no need to get hung up on fancy brands of sun cream either. Most supermarkets stock their own creams and oils for a fraction of the price you’ll pay elsewhere and according to consumer magazine Which? – they’re just as good as all the rest.11. Crosstown traffic: When the sun shines in Ireland many of us will decide to take a spontaneous trip to the beach. That is all fine and dandy until you find yourself watching the day pass you by while you are stuck in traffic. So, no matter what part of the country you find yourself in the weeks ahead, before you race off to the beach, take a moment to look at Google Maps. You won’t be looking for directions – you will probably be able to make your way to the local beaches unaided – but what you are looking for is traffic congestion. The software uses some class of sorcery to establish how bad the traffic is on whatever route you fancy in real time. A 90 second look may save you spending two hours of a rare sunny day stuck in traffic jams swearing at fellow drivers and shouting at your children.12. The tide is high, or is it?: Oh, and in case you forget – like Pricewatch has done far too often – unlike the Mediterranean, the waters around Ireland are tidal and can be dramatically so. So before you race off to the beach for a bracing dip, check where the water’s edge is likely to be. The Irish Tides and Tidal Ireland apps will be able to help you out.13. Keep it fun: “Are we there yet?” “I’m thirsty.” “I need to go to the toilet.” “Juliette scratched me.” “I can’t find my Elsa doll.” Kids are brilliant but cross-country journeys can be long and trying. If you’re taking a road trip with smallies plan some games in advance so you’re not left thinking up things on the fly. Here are three that might work. There is I Spy (obvs) - top tip: ban things that were outside the car for half a second as you sped along a motorway. Road Trip Bingo is always a winner but it takes prep. Print out bespoke bingo cards and give each player a pencil. When they see something on their card, they scratch it out. The more items you have on the card the less time they have to fight. With I’m Going on a Picnic, the first player says, “I’m going on a picnic and I’m bringing . . . an apple” or something else that begins with A. The second player repeats what the first person said, but adds something that begins with B. And on it goes. Make the prizes substantial to keep interest levels high.14. Book smarts: If you can’t think of any games to play or if the level of interest is low, download some audio books and everything will be golden. A David Walliams book read by the author himself or a Harry Potter read by Stephen Fry will see many journeys fly by. If you have older people in a car and want something hilarious to listen to, we couldn’t recommend the books of David Sedaris highly enough.15. Chipper chips: Do a bit of research and find the best chipper wherever you are going. Chipper chips, bread, butter and a cup of tea is a summer meal sorted. If you are really fancy you can throw in some mushy peas some battered cod and maybe even a pint of stout. You won’t get the like of it anywhere but home."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Avian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: iStockA “large increase” in rats leaving the sewers and infesting city streets and suburbs has emerged during the coronavirus pandemic as pest control teams have been curtailed, Dublin City Council has said.Rats, described by one councillor as big enough to “put a saddle on”, are eating through brickwork and circumventing traps to infest homes, gardens and even cars.Recent warm weather, fewer people on the streets and increased illegal dumping had encouraged more rats into the open, the council said. However its ability to tackle infestations had been reduced as the Health Service Executive (HSE) pest control services were restricted during the pandemic.Sinn Féin councillor Daniel Céitinn said south inner-city residential areas around York Street, Montague Court and Bishop Street were becoming overrun with rats.“They are nesting in broken drains and seem to be becoming more aggressive in their search for food. They’re also getting into cars and ruining the engines,” he said. “I understand resources are scare at the moment, but not dealing with this is creating another health emergency.”SuburbsInfestations were multiplying in the suburbs too. Fianna Fáil’s Racheal Batten said there were particular problems in estates around Beaumont. Reduced activity during Covid-19 restrictions “seems to have given them a better chance to breed”, she said.Independent councillor Noeleen Reilly said there were similar problems in Ballymun. “I’ve never seen illegal dumping as bad, and that is definitely leading to an increase in rats.”The council said there had been “a large increase in the number of rats coming up from the pipe networks and onto the streets” and “we had instances where rats had eaten through brickwork in manholes and somehow managed to get by trap gullies on the roadways”.PoisonsControlling the rat populations was becoming increasingly problematic because of stricter regulation of poisons and because rat “enforcement action” was a matter for the HSE.“During the Covid-19 crisis, the HSE did not carry out pest control in our flat complexes, as they did prior to the pandemic. In the absence of the HSE, Dublin City Council continued to provide this service, which placed additional strain on our resources,” the council added.The HSE said it had been restricted on entering homes during the pandemic, but had continued to provide external “rodent control”. It would recommence entering properties from June 15th.Suggestions that could change Dublin for the better"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Major easing of lockdown as zero deaths recorded in

mandatory","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t (L to R)Minister For Health Simon Harris TD, Anne Graham CEO NTA,Taoiseach Leo Varadkar TD Minister for Transport Shane Ross wearing face masks during a press briefing to promote the wearing of masks on Public transport at Merrion Square, Dublin Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe Government is not ruling out making face coverings on public transport and retail outlets mandatory to help stop the spread of coronavirus, the Taoiseach has said.Leo Varadkar launched a Government campaign to encourage people to wear face coverings on buses and trains and other public transport as more shops begin to open.Mr Varadkar called for the public to use face masks in places where social distancing is difficult, including public transport, crowded indoor places or when visiting the home of someone who has been cocooning.“It’s seen as an additional hygiene measure that can help reduce the spread of infection,” he said.“There will be a government ad campaign running over the coming days and weeks.“I do see people using them more and more so I think the message is getting across.”Asked whether Government will enforce wearing face coverings, Mr Varadkar said: “We have given it consideration in making it mandatory, we don’t rule that out, but there are real difficulties with that.“Some people have phobias, some people have breathing difficulties, there’s lots of different reasons as to why you wouldn’t make it mandatory.“From what we have seen during the pandemic is Irish people really understanding and following public health advice, and we haven’t had to underpin much of that with laws or fines.“It’s much better to have people understand why it’s right to wear a mask and do it voluntarily.”He added that the idea of refusing people entry into shops and on public transport without a mask is “under consideration”.Minister for Health Simon Harris said: “Today is a really important step in our information campaign and at each stage of the Covid pandemic we need to look for new measures to take and we know that when it comes to face coverings that you can wear one and make it harder for your droplets to transfer to someone else.“We are asking you, on all types of public transport and shops, in supermarkets to wear a face covering.“It’s going to require us getting in the habit of putting our face covering in a bag in your pocket just like you do with you phone, keys or wallet.“It’s not a magic shield from the coronavirus, but it is an additional hygiene measure.”Senior civil servant Liz Canavan said that face coverings protect people from the risk of infection others might be carrying.“You may not even be displaying the symptoms,” she added.“It’s important how you use your mask or other covering.“It’s important how you dispose of it, and if it’s reusable how you keep it clean.“Advice on all of this, including how to make your own face mask is available on gov.ie.”Shopping centresMeanwhile, shopping centres have reopened and people are allowed to visit their loved ones in nursing homes and residential care facilities as lockdown measures continue to ease.The Government had originally not envisaged reopening shopping centres until August 10th but it has been brought forward as coronavirus has been suppressed in recent weeks.Last Monday, all retail shops reopened, with hundreds turning up to queue at major retailers such as Ikea and Zara.Shopping centre owners have been given time to modify the inside of the buildings to ensure there can be safe social distancing.Seating and dining areas will be removed to lessen dwell time among shoppers while people will be advised not to browse for long periods of time.To enforce social distancing, there will be limits on the number of customers allowed into stores.People will be allowed to visit nursing homes and residential care facilities following a ban on non-essential visits since early March.Sage Advocacy, which campaigns for vulnerable people and patients, said people are “counting down the minutes to see their loved ones again”.Executive director of Sage Advocacy Mervyn Taylor said many families had suffered heartbreak and loss during the pandemic.He said: “We also recognise how difficult it has been for nursing staff, carers and all workers in care homes and residential care facilities.People have been advised to ring ahead before they visit a nursing home and to wear a face covering and gloves, and visits should not last more than half an hour.On Sunday, it was reported that one more person with Covid-19 died in Ireland, bringing the overall death toll to 1,706.A further eight cases were confirmed, bringing the total number of cases to 25,303. –PAEverything you need

plan","story":"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar holds his first press conference following the announcement that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens have agreed a draft for government with Martin set to become the next taoiseach. Video: RTE News Now\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA new scheme will seek to retrofit 500,000 homes by 2030 on a ‘aggregated’ model – meaning that certain towns or areas will be retrofitted at the same time to achieve economies of scale. File photograph: Frank Miller The draft programme for government “Our Shared Future” runs to nearly 50,000 words. It contains commitments under a variety of policy headings for the next five years.EconomyThe first section of the draft programme for government says that a new system of measuring national progress is needed to supplement, but not replace, the existing economic measures.It promises “a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how our society is faring” and “a balanced scorecard for each area of public policy focused on outcomes and the impact that those policies have on iniduals and communities. Initially this will be focused on housing, education and health”.The drawing up of these new measurements will be done in the Department of the Taoiseach in consultation with “a group of experts from the public service, academia, NGOs and the private sector to guide this work”.The new government also promises to “prioritise town centres”, providing funding for bringing derelict buildings back into use.It will publish the first “clean air strategy”, and also extend the ban on smoky coal to new towns and “move towards a full nationwide ban”.Major changes are on the way in transport, and there will be a 2:1 split in capital spending on public transport and roads.Some 10 per cent of the total transport capital budget will be spent on cycling and a further 10 per cent on walking infrastructure, amounting to €360 million per year. Every local authority will be required to introduce a plan to promote cycling. All children will be offered cycling training in school. Public transport fares will be reviewed and a rural public transport service which connects localities to the public transport system will be developed.The registration of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned after 2030 and they will be “phased out” in cities. All new buses are to be electric or hybrid and after 2025, public sector bodies will only be allowed to buy low or no-emission cars. Financial assistance will be offered to taxi drivers switching to electric cars.On the economy, the document pledges to create 200,000 new jobs by 2025. There will be a “July stimulus”, financed by a Recovery Fund, followed by a national economic plan published in the autumn in conjunction with the Budget. There will be continued support for SMEs, and special support for the hospitality, retail, entertainment and arts sectors. The National Economic Plan will focus heavily on retraining and upskilling, and will include a plan to retrofit half a million homes by 2030.The document promises to reduce the deficit once the impact of Covid-19 has passed, through tax and expenditure measures if necessary.“We will utilise taxation measures, as well as expenditure measures, to close the deficit and fund public services if required. In doing so, we will focus any tax rises on those taxes which tax behaviours with negative externalities such as carbon tax, sugar tax, plastics, etc,” it says.Carbon tax will rise to €100 per tonne by 2030, up from the current target of €80.The government will retain the 12.5 corporation tax rate.The document says the government will seek to negotiate a new public sector pay deal, but does not make any mention of pay rises due to public servants in the autumn.Any “windfall” gains for the State from Nama or the sale of bank stakes will be used to reduce debt. A commission on welfare and taxation will be established. Most homeowners will face no increases in the local property tax, it promises, but new homes which are current exempt will be brought into the net.There will be a review of the National Development Plan, with 2023 to be designated the “Year of the Invitation - a global invitation to visit Ireland on the 10-year anniversary of The Gathering”.The document also promises to tackle insurance costs and develop a new national digital strategy.Green new deal The draft programme contains a lengthy mission statement in favour of a “Green New Deal.”The parties commit Ireland to an average 7 per cent per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, which is a 51 per cent reduction over the decade, with the aim of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The 2050 target will be set in law by the Climate Action Bill which will be introduced in the Dáil within the first 100 days of government alongside a newly established Climate Action Council.“The Bill will define how five-year carbon budgets will be set,” the document says.The “special economic and social role of agriculture and the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane... will be fully recognised in plans to achieve these targets,” it adds.The deal promises the delivery of a “National Aggregated Model of Retrofitting” reaching over 500,000 homes by 2030 and pledges an accelerated electrification of the transport system including electric bikes, electric vehicles and electric public transport alongside a ban on new registrations of petrol and diesel cars from 2030.It promises a strategy for remote working and remote service delivery as well as an unprecedented modal shift in all areas by a re-orientation of investment to walking, cycling and public transport.There will also be a “major drive to realise the immense potential of Ireland’s offshore renewables.”The parties have agreed on a new strategy to expand afforestation and plan to “transform organic farming with delivery of a fair price for farmers at its heart.”Every minister will be asked to make climate action a “core pillar” of their new departmental strategies, which must be produced within six months of the Government taking office.The Government will propose that the Oireachtas establishes a standing Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action, with powers similar to the Public Accounts Committee.On energy, there will be a new National Energy Efficiency Action Plan to reduce energy use while there are also plans to complete the Celtic Interconnector to connect Ireland’s electricity grid to France.The parties will end the issuing of new licenses for exploration and extraction of gas “on the same basis as the recent decision in relation to oil exploration and extraction.”The three parties say that they do not believe it makes sense to develop the LNG gas import terminals importing fracked gas and accordingly they will withdraw the Shannon LNG terminal from the EU Projects of Common Interest list in 2021.There will be a policy statement to back up the Government position that it does not support the importation of fracked gas.The Government will also phase out the use of singe use plastics and introduce a deposit and return scheme for plastic bottles and aluminum cans.At least 500,000 homes will be retrofitted to a B2 energy rating by 2030 starting in the midlands and people will be given the option to repay retrofitting costs through their utility bills.The parties plan to commence a targeted programme to install heat pumps in homes as part of an overall plan to install 600,000 heat pumps by 2030.There will also be a public sector decarbonisation target of at least 50 per cent.The new Government will also establish the “Just Transition Commissioner” as a statutory office with appropriate staffing and resources.It promises to progress the establishment of a Citizens’ Assembly on Bioersity and retain Irish Water in public ownership as a national, standalone, regulated utility. It will continue to provide a generous free allowance of water to every citizen and conduct a feasibility study examining how further assistance can be given to low income households for the installation of water efficient appliances.New social contract The new Government has undertaken to provide a “safety net” to those most severely impacted by Covid-19 as the special unemployment payments and income protection payments come to an end. There is a commitment to protect social welfare rates in addition to other benefits which vulnerable groups are currently entitled to. There is also a promise to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the government, although there are no details on what figure that might be. In terms of pensions - one of the big sticking points of negotiations - those who each the retirement age of 65 will no longer have to sign on and be actively seeking work. In tandem with that there will be a Total Contributions Approach aligning the contributory pension closer to the contribution that has been made. Free travel wil lremain for those aged 66 and over. In addition, a new auto-enrolment scheme will be introduced for pensions, to encourage more people to have a separate pension scheme to the State pension. This will be an opt-out scheme and will be phased in over a decade. A Low Pay Commission is also being retained to determine the appropriate level for the minimum wage. he Commission will also look at another Green ask, that of introducing Universal Basis Income. In the area of equality, there is a commitment to give long-term undocumented immigrants a pathway to regularise the status. This will happen within 18 months of the formation fothe Government. On direct provision the document commits to ensure a move away from the current centres to “accommodation for asylum seekers that has the protection and promotion of human rights at its core”. The new system will be not-for-profit and an expert group will produce recommendations for how it will work by the end of this year. In the meantime, the Government will work to improve conditions for those currently in the system. LGBT1+ policy will include legislation to allow adoptive leave and benefit for same-sex male couples, a ban on conversion therapy, and the expunging of criminal records for gay men convicted of historical offences. Those aged 16 and 17 will not longer have to acquire two specialist reports to apply for gender recognition. On disability, there is a promise to prioritise early diagnosis interventions, an awareness-campaign, with a special emphasis in the short term on helping those who were most impacted by Covid-19. The programme recognises that cost of, and access to, childcare remains a problem. The three parties promise to reduce the cost of childcare for parents. In terms of Covid-19, there will be cost reductions for parents through the National Childcare Scheme. Parental leave will be extended to allow parents have more time with the child in the first year. There is also a plege to increase remote working, more flexible hours and hub working arrangements to support families. ‘Building stronger and safer communities’ In terms of the Garda Síochána the programme commits to continue recruitment, to encourage more community policing, relieve gardaí from non-core duties an to encourage more ersity within the force. There is a pledge to extend powers for use of CCTV and and automated number plate recognition to help prevent crime. The Dublin North-East Inner City model to tackle crime and address disadvantage will be extended to other areas. There is a promise also to bolster powers against white-collar crime including amending legislation to ensure prosecutions happen more quickly.Legislation will be published on family courts designed to have a less adversarial court to family law cases. That will include a new family law court building. There is also a commitment to establish a new planning and environmental law court.A gambling regulator is also being established within the lifetime of the government, a body that has been promised for many successive governments. Hate crime will also be legislated for with specific offences to ensure those who target victims over identity will be prosecuted for hate crime. The Incitment to Hatred Act 1989 will also be updated. The programme notes there is an epidemic of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in Ireland and commits to an audit within nine months to see how Government Departments inidually, and as a whole, deal with these crimes. Education and research The programme for government commits to establishing a Citizens’ Assembly on the future of education at primary and secondary level and also promises a new digital education strategy.The primary curriculum will be reviewed and reformed as will the post primary curriculum “prioritising elements such as critical thinking, problem solving and continuous assessment so that they feature more centrally.”In primary schools there will also be a new healthy eating education programme, a new modern languages programme and a strategy to support gifted and talented students at both primary and post primacy.The parties will also seek to increase the capitation grant with a view to reducing the reliance on voluntary contributions made to schools. They also plan to to further reduce teacher ratios in primary schools although a specific number is not mentioned in the document.A free schoolbooks scheme would also pilot in September 2020 and if successful this would be expanded nationwide “if resources allow.”There are plans for additional supports for students who are homeless, resident in family hubs, or in direct provision. The parties also want to achieve the target of at least 400 multi-denominational primary schools by 2030 to improve parental choice.In terms of higher education, the draft document also pledges to develop a long-term sustainable funding model for Higher Level education in collaboration with the sector. Student contributions will be maintained at the current level. The new Government will conduct a review of the SUSI scheme in 2020 following the impact of COVID-19.There is a commitment to provide a range of free, adequate, safe and suitable period products in all educational publicly-funded settings.On research, the parties will examine solutions for extensions for researchers who cannot access facilities to complete projects as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.A shared islandA new unit will be established in the Department of Taoiseach “to work towards a consensus on a shared island”.“This unit will examine the political, social, economic and cultural considerations underpinning a future in which all traditions are mutually respected.”The parties also plan to work with the Executive and the UK Government to “deepen multi-agency cross-border co-operation on crime, including information sharing between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and An Garda Síochána.”They will also seek to develop an all-island strategy to tackle climate breakdown and the bioersity crisis.The document also says the new Government will work with the Northern Ireland Executive to deliver key cross-border infrastructure initiatives, including the A5, the Ulster Canal connection from Clones to Upper Lough Erne, the Narrow Water Bridge, and cross-border greenways, in particular the Sligo-Enniskillen greenwayThey will also “ensure the Decade of Centenaries is marked in an inclusive, appropriate and sensitive manner.”The parties will engage with the British Government with a view to ensuring access by “an independent, international judicial figure” to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1971, the bombing of Kay’s Tavern and the murder of Seamus Ludlow – in accordance with the all-party Dáil motions on these matters.HousingThe Land Development Agency will develop cost rental housing, as well as affordable purchase homes, affordable rental homes and social housing on State-owned land.Some 50,000 social homes will be provided over the next five years, with an emphasis on new builds.The Part V provision, under which developers must set aside 10 per cent of their projects for social housing, will be expanded to include affordable homes, although the exact level has not yet been set.The current cap on the amount of money local authorities can spend on social housing developments will increase from €2 million to €6 million.A referendum on the right to housing is mooted. Defence and international issues The proposed new government will establish an independent Commission on the Defence Forces looking at arrangements for the effective defence of the country at land and sea.The commission will consider a number of areas including allowances and composition of the force as well as recruitment and retention. It will also look at the role of the Reserve Defence Forces. It will be established by the end of the year and report within 12 months.A pledge is also made to develop a new Institute for Peace Support and Leadership Training in the Curragh.The new government commits to holding a referendum on extending the franchise at presidential elections to Irish citizens living outside the State.It will also publish a new diaspora policy in 2020. The document also aims to develop a new strategy to increase the presence of Irish people in the senior ranks of the EU institutions, “targeting an increase in the number of young Irish people applying for internships and working with Irish officials and universities on outreach”.The draft document references the Occupied Territories Bill but the only specific pledge is to honour commitment to recognise the State of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict “or in advance of that, when we believe doing so will progress efforts to reach a two-state solution or protect Palestinian territories.A new government would continue to oppose any annexation or plans to oppose any annexation or plans to apply Israeli sovereignty over territory in the West Bank, which is part of the occupied territories but re-asserts policy commitment to a two-state solution.Ireland will reach its 50th anniversary during the lifetime of the proposed government. On EU issues the document expresses “clear support for free trade while insisting on high environmental and labour standards and fair trading practices”.Targets include ensuring Ireland’s interests and values “are reflected in any proposals for EU strategic autonomy in response to Covid-19, such as incentives to produce certain goods within Europe”.Government policy will remain pro-enlargement and support the Western Balkan countries in particular to progress along the accession path.The Government will develop the ‘Ireland House’ model, bringing all State agencies and government departments based abroad together under one roof to encourage joined-up thinking.It aims to reach UN overseas aid donation target of 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income by 2030.It will work to restore the Single Market’s integrity, learning lessons from the response to Covid-19 and ensure Ireland’s position on trade deals is “strongly informed by the need to ensure that all international trade deals support the aims of the Paris Climate Agreement”.PlebiscitesA number of plebiscites are planned with a pledge to pass legislation to allow the first directly elected mayor in Limerick to be elected in 2021. It will allow for plebiscites to be held in 2024 in any local authority that wishes to have a directly elected mayor. Where directly elected mayors are being established, “we will transfer powers from the city and county managers to mayors directly elected by the people for a five-year term”.Next year it will establish a Citizens’ Assembly to consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin.On media it will “bring together all policy functions relating to broadcast media, print media and online media into a single media ision within a government department”.It will also “review and reform defamation laws to ensure a balanced approach to the right to freedom of expression, the right to protection of good name and reputation, and the right of access to justice”It will establish a future of media commission to consider the future of print, broadcast and online media and to report within nine months.

Video: RTE News Now\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and his team arrive at Government Buildings.Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThey will vote on sending the deal to the party memberships, though it would be a major shock if any of the parties were to refuse to take that step. However, the stance taken by Catherine Martin, the Green Party deputy leader, will be closely watched. Her support could be crucial to the chances of the deal passing with the Greens.How do the party memberships vote?Each party has its own system to decide on the deal. Fianna Fáil has a one-member, one-vote straight ballot among party members, with postal ballots likely to be sent out on Monday.Fine Gael has a more complicated electoral system, involving delegates from each constituency, the executive council and the party’s elected representatives. However, the parliamentary party makes up 50 per cent of the electoral college, so this is by far the most important forum.But it is the Green Party which is likely to face the toughest struggle to ratify the deal. The party constitution requires a two-thirds majority among members to approve any coalition agreement, so it is entirely possible that a majority could support the deal – just not a big enough majority. If that happens, the deal is dead in the water.When will the voting take place?Ballots will be issued to those entitled to vote in the coming days, and once returned, will be counted next week by party headquarters. But the timelines are tight, and there are concerns among some party officials that longer postal delivery times because of the Covid-19 pandemic may result in ballots arriving after a deadline. Anyway, a deadline can’t be extended beyond the end of next week. There was a suggestion that all three parties would announce the results simultaneously, but nothing has been agreed at this point.So what are the deadlines?Votes in both Houses of the Oireachtas on renewing the Offences Against the State Act must be taken before June 30th, or key sections, including those underpinning the Special Criminal Court, will lapse. This vote is held every year and is normally a formality. But unless a new taoiseach is in place to make his 11 nominations to the Seanad, the vote can’t be held in the upper house as it will be legally incomplete, the Government has been advised.So the Dáil needs to elect a new taoiseach, he needs to form a new government and make his nominations to the Seanad before June 30th to allow a vote to take place in that house on that day, a fortnight from next Tuesday.A group of Senators says it will seek a declaration from the High Court this week that the Seanad can legislate without the taoiseach’s 11. If that is successful, it would take the concern about the Offences Against the State Act out of the picture and relax the deadlines, though it would also mean that the Government’s legal advice on the issue was wrong.Assuming the Attorney General’s advice is correct and the end of June deadline holds, the new taoiseach will have to be elected, at the latest on Monday, June 29th, though there are suggestions that it should take place on Friday 26th. There has been no agreement yet among the parties on the precise choreography.Who will be taoiseach?Micheál Martin will be the agreed nominee of the new coalition for the role of taoiseach, with Leo Varadkar taking a Cabinet job – a new Department of the Economy has been mooted for him – and the role of tánaiste. Varadkar – or rather, whoever is the leader of Fine Gael – will become taoiseach halfway through the new government’s five-year term.If Martin is elected by the Dáil, he will then nominate his Cabinet later that day, which would require another Dáil vote. He would also nominate his 11 senators, as previously agreed with the other two party leaders.How are the Cabinet jobs going to be shared out?It is expected that the 15 Cabinet jobs will be allocated on a 6:6:3 ratio, with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil having six members each, and the Greens three. A small number of super junior ministers – probably two, one each for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael – may also be permitted to attend Cabinet, as they do at present. The chief whip also attends.There will be intense speculation over the coming weeks about who gets the jobs. It is a particularly tricky situation for Varadkar, who will have to demote several Fine Gael Ministers and junior Ministers, but Varadkar himself, Paschal Donohoe, Simon Coveney, Simon Harris and Heather Humphries are likely to return.And what happens if one of the parties reject the deal?Sources in all parties agree that while Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are odds-on to accept the deal, it’s impossible to predict the outcome among the Green Party at this stage.If that party rejects the agreement, sources say Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will seek to go ahead and form a government with the support of a number of independent TDs, though the climate action aspects of the programme for government are likely to be watered down.But there is no certainty that such an agreement could be put together quickly, or at all.

Photograph:  Claus FiskerRitzau Scanpix via APWith huge traffic jams and a run on cheap cigarettes, border-free Europe was back in business on Monday, just in time for the summer holidays.Three months of pandemic closures across the continent, setting aside the so-called Schengen rules to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, ended at midnight. But many border reopenings are as haphazard as the closures, with each EU country building its own metaphorical sandcastle.With more borders than any other European country, Germany reopened its doors and lifted its non-essential travel warning to 27 European countries including popular holiday destinations Italy, Austria, Greece, France and Croatia. The country’s travel restrictions for visitors from outside the EU remains in place until at least July 1st.Berlin is also strongly advising Germans to avoid Britain and Northern Ireland, saying that ergent test and collating methods makes it likely there is a “considerable” number of undetected Covid-19 cases there.While Germany remains closed to Spaniards for now, Madrid has moved forward its reopening by 10 days to June 21st. Already on Monday it allowed about 10,000 Germans to fly to Mallorca and the other Balearic Islands for a trial run – waiving its 14-day quarantine for the groups.“This pilot programme will help us learn a lot for what lies ahead in the coming months,” said Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez. “We want our country, which is already known as a world-class tourist destination, to be recognised as also a secure destination.”The Polish-German border was reopened to all on midnight on Saturday morning between Frankfurt (Oder) and Slubice to the sound of cheers and Champagne corks popping.At midnight on Monday five of Germany’s 13 border crossing to Denmark were opened, and were promptly clogged with traffic. A Danish holiday home company manager said the first German guests collected their keys at 2.15am, with 80 more collected in the subsequent two hours.Traffic queues formed early on Monday further west on the French-Belgian border, too, where tobacconists in the Belgian border village of Macquenoise were swamped with French smokers looking for bargains after prices rose at home.AustriaFurther south, Austria, an important European north-south transit country, threw open its borders and lifted a quarantine requirement for incoming travellers from within the EU – excluding the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain and Portugal.The Alpine republic has also loosened its mask rules, with face coverings no longer obligatory in shops and other public places, though they remain a requirement on public transport and in pharmacies and healthcare facilities.Greece, another popular holiday destination, is open again but visitors from France, Belgium and Italy will be tested on arrival while others face random tests.Sweden, which took a more liberal lockdown approach, remains an outlier in Europe – with its citizens not yet welcome in much of Europe.On three days over the weekend the Nordic country reported 2,850 new Covid-19 cases, two weeks after it loosened travel restrictions to allow citizens travel anywhere in the country.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278912.1592148617!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nil all at half time in tortuous brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA timetable for the second half of Brexit talks has been set out with six rounds of negotiations to take place between June 29th and August 21st. Photograph: EPAOlivier HosletLife seemed to pause in February, and this seems to have affected the perception of time. Incredibly, half of 2020 is gone: and that means just six months remain before goods sold into Britain will be subject to border checks, customs declarations, and possibly tariffs.These onerous changes will come into force no matter what deal is agreed between London and Brussels, and indeed if no deal is agreed at all. They are expected to have a heavy impact on companies in the Republic, and any businesses across the EU dependent on exports to Britain. Firms have been asked to prepare as a matter of urgency.The British government has said, definitively, that it will not extend the transition period. Instead, it proposes to introduce the border requirements in stages. Checks on live animals will come into force right away in January. Pre-notification and health certification for meat, dairy, and other animal products will come into force from April. Full checks and declarations will be in place from July. For the first half of the year, companies will have a grace period to make customs declarations for their goods and pay whatever tariffs are required.Since February, talks between Britain and the European Union have continued over video calls to try to hash out a deal that avoids the harshest outcome of an automatic shift to World Trade Organisation trade terms on January 1st. The state of the talks now could be described as nil-all at half time. Both teams have played defensively and sat deep on the pitch neither has conceded, no one has scored.The second half British prime minister Boris Johnson will join a video conference on Monday with the presidents of the three European institutions of the commission, council, and parliament: Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel, and David Sassoli. Earlier this year, Britain was warning that it could use this moment to dramatically walk away from talks and declare it would spend all its energy on preparing for World Trade Organisation terms. It has shifted away from this approach, instead pushing the EU to enter intensive talks next month.A timetable for the second half has been set out: six rounds of negotiations are to take place between June 29th and August 21st. Negotiators will alternate between physical meetings in Brussels and London as long as national health guidance allows it, but talks could shift online again.What the EU is seeking in the talks was decided by the 27 remaining members of the EU and given to chief negotiator Michel Barnier in a 46-page mandate in February.He has updated the member states and the European institutions throughout the talks, as any shift or concession by the EU side can only be given with consensus agreement.No change to the mandate is needed to get an agreement, he told the European Parliament last week. “We can find the necessary compromises, on the condition that the UK changes its approach,” the Frenchman said.Areas of disagreementThere are four stubborn areas of disagreement. One is the so-called level playing field: the EU’s ambition to ensure fair competition between British and EU countries. Brussels will not grant British companies free access to EU markets if they can undercut local businesses it will only do so if they are required to follow equivalent standards on, for example, labour and the environment. This is anathema to Britain, as it sounds like signing back up to the kind of regulatory restrictions it left the EU to escape.Too bad, Brussels responds: no free access for your businesses to the single market then.Another issue is fisheries. In a nutshell: Britain wants to take back exclusive rights over its territorial waters. These would give it far more fish than the British could eat. Want to sell fish to the EU? Fine, says Brussels, but only if EU fishing boats can have access to British waters. The EU side wants to stick to the existing quota system for this Britain wants to introduce yearly access talks.On policing and judicial cooperation, Britain does not want to continue to follow EU data protection standards, and shies away from an agreement with the EU on human rights, which it says has no place in a trade deal. The final issue is governance: ie, how disputes could be mediated. Britain does not want the ultimate authority to be the European Court of Justice the EU insists this is the only body that can rule on matters of EU law.British negotiators can sound somewhat indignant at the EU’s insistence on written and legal guarantees on matters such as standards and human rights, insisting that Britain has high standards, and should be trusted, rather than treated as a potential violator.No compromiseThe EU accuses Britain of continuing to not accept that negative consequences are inevitable from Brexit, and of demanding privileges that are only available to member states. The British negotiators accuse the EU of failing to accept its sovereignty, and of asking for things that go far beyond previous trade deals with countries like Japan or Canada. Brussels rejects this comparison,\u0026nbsp explaining that Japan and Canada are far away, so don’t have the ability to undercut the EU that Britain could have.Brussels believes it has the upper hand, because if Britain chooses not to compromise and to go for World Trade Organization terms, the same EU negotiating mandate will await them if they return for talks to ease the tariffs. There is some flexibility on details, but the principles will not shift. “The United Kingdom chose to become a third country. It cannot have the best of both worlds!” Barnier put it to parliament. “We want a very ambitious economic partnership, but it must reflect the long-term economic and political interests of the EU. This is not a dogmatic or technocratic position,” he added. “Simply: we will never compromise on our European values or on our economic and trade interests, to the benefit of the British economy.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

Fashion addict that I am, I had been commissioned to report on the post-pandemic shopping scene. But then a call came just after 8am: “Forget it. We all know it’s going to be dire.” I rolled over and went back to sleep.When even an inveterate pounder of pavements such as myself can’t be tempted, then Great British retail is officially shafted.Britain is – still – a nation of shopkeepers, making it no less a nation of frenetic buyers. Shopping is our foremost leisure activity, the one sport at which we excel, a quotidian drama in which we all play a part. From medieval Cambridge’s Stourbridge Fair (inspiration for Bunyan’s – thus Thackeray’s – Vanity Fair), via London’s New Exchange of 1609, to Harry Selfridge deeming his customer audiences ready to be entertained, our retail arenas have been sites of spectacle, means of constructing identity, and pure socioeconomic theatre.If all shopping is theatre, then how much more so clothes shopping, in which we actors get to rig ourselves out? I love the amateur dramatics of the rag trade, have lived for it during dark periods: the opportunity to act, to perform, to transform myself into some brighter, lighter, altogether better being. Oh, the pure sensuousness (in the Miltonic, non-sexual sense): the touch, the feel, the scent and sound of the thing! Oh, the pure sensualness (in the non-Miltonic, sexual sense): our pupils dilated, cheeks flushed, drunk on the adrenaline of the thrill of the chase.Pre-Covid, I boasted no existential ennui that could not be cured by a turn round Zara, while sipping on a disposable cup, meditatively weighing up fabrics. And now? While in theory I long to support our retail industry – not least when the British Fashion Council predicts that half of it may be laid waste – in practice I am grounded. I’m not scared, merely not interested. This barren facsimile of my former joy – with its no-touching, its plastic screens, its quarantining of items – is so denuded of pleasure as to be not worth the queuing. I looked to my fashion fix to provide a will to live, and the new consumerism just isn’t selling it.Besides, as fashion has become not so much fast as frenzied, the need for a reset has become impossible to ignore. The high priestess of consumption, Vogue’s Anna Wintour, has felt forced to concede of the corona crisis that: “It is an opportunity for all of us to … think about the waste and the … excess that we’ve all … indulged in.” My cup, my Zara fillip are – like – so over.After three months cold turkey, I have found myself thinking not: “I am a fashion addict, where’s my next hit?” rather: “As a responsible citizen, which brands do I want to support?” The answer has been quality-obsessed British labels: fashion fetishist Alexa Chung, tweed gurus Holland \u0026amp Cooper, and silk and cashmere queen Tabitha Webb. I can source vintage brilliance on Vestiaire Collective, ferret out bargains on Yoox.Our shops have taken on a Soviet-era joylessness, making virtual purchasing more visceral. The shops will be back, but not in this sheathed and sterile form. Meanwhile, I’ll be sating myself “shopping” in my wardrobe, as the supremely sensuous artist Mona Hatoum once recommended to me – because all of us already have a cornucopia awaiting there.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no scientific evidence support disastrous two metre rule","story":"Queuing outside shops, dodging each other once inside, and not getting too close to other people anywhere: social-distancing has become the norm. The two-metre rule, however, is also seriously impacting schools, pubs, restaurants and our ability to go about our daily lives. The Government is reviewing the policy, but what evidence is there that keeping our distance makes any difference to catching Covid?The influential Lancet review provided evidence from 172 studies in support of physical distancing of one metre or more. This might sound impressive, but all the studies were retrospective and suffer from biases that undermine the reliability of their findings. Recall bias arises in research when participants do not remember previous events accurately, and it is problematic when studies look back in time at how people behaved, including how closely they stood from others.More concerning was that only five of the 172 studies reported specifically on Covid exposure and proximity with infection. These studies included a total of merely 477 patients, with just 26 actual cases of infection. In only one study was a specific distance measure reported: “came within six feet of the index patient”. The result showed no effect of distance on contracting Covid.In another study of 121 healthcare workers exposed to a patient with unrecognised Covid-19, three workers went on to test positive. Yet all three had unprotected patient contact: two never wore a facemask, respirator, eye protection or gown, making it impossible to identify the specific effects of distance. In the one study with the most substantial effect, no distance measure was reported. It was designed to test any association between sleep quality, stress and risk of infection, not distance.On further independent inspection of 15 studies included in the review, we found multiple inconsistencies in the data, numerical mistakes and unsound methods in 13 of them. When assumptions over distance were made, we could not replicate any of them.Might evidence from so-called super-spreading events show more promise? Following a choir practice in Skagit County, Washington, 32 cases of Covid were confirmed among the attendees. But how Covid was transmitted has not been established. Several opportunities for droplet transmission occurred, but also fomite transmission via objects which are likely to carry infection. The choir members did sit near to each other, but they also shared cookies and oranges. No one reported any physical contact. Vital information is missing.The evidence does show that the risk of catching infections is higher in healthcare settings than in the community, and higher indoors than outdoors. What the evidence cannot say is that there is any measured distance that reduces your risk. The tendency to develop, interpret and report information confirming one’s prior beliefs has distorted conventional methods for creating guidance based on the best available evidence. Confirmation bias warps our thinking and can have a significant effect on the proper functioning of society by misrepresenting the evidence.GP consultation data, on the other hand, has shown that simply encouraging social distancing and handwashing reduced transmission of acute respiratory tract infections by about half pre-lockdown. Handwashing and encouragement are what we need, not formalised rules. This means trying to keep a distance from each other where possible and avoiding spending time indoors in crowded places. Much of the evidence informing policy in this outbreak is poor quality let us hope that evidence-informed decision-making will at some point resume.Carl Heneghan is director and Tom Jefferson is an honorary research fellow at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, University of OxfordMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"parties strike deal form new irish government","story":"Ireland\u0027s Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and Green parties struck a deal to form a new coalition government on Monday that if ratified by members will end a months-long stalemate and is expected to make Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin prime minister.Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar is expected to return as prime minister in 2022 for the second half of the government\u0027s five-year term.The leaders have signed off on the draft programme for government and it will issue later this afternoon, Fine Gael said in a statement.

John Lewis was reopening two branches on Monday, while Argos was due to open just 145 out of more than 800 stores.Primark is taking a different approach, reopening all of its 153 stores. The budget clothing specialist has been hit harder than most by the lockdown as it does not have an online storefront, meaning goods have been left stacked up in warehouses or on shelves. JD Sports is reopening all 309 of its branches on Monday.Certain shops face particular challenges in complying with government guidance, such as shoe retailers which now have to “quarantine” pairs that customers have tried on. Changing rooms at most clothes shops will remain closed while bookshops have said they will take items off shelves after people have touched them. Waterstones will only return items to the shop floor after 72 hours.Shops are required to install screens at checkouts and mark two-metre distance intervals on the floor to help customers stay apart. Retailers including Ikea and John Lewis have introduced social distancing wardens to help with this.As with supermarkets, numbers within non-essential stores will be strictly limited, meaning shoppers will be faced with queues outside.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailRichard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, forecasts that shopping centres will be slower to reopen than high streets because people will prefer to shop in local, familiar, open-air environments, rather than travel to large complexes.He pointed out that shopping centres often attracted consumers looking for a day out by offering an array of food options and other leisure experiences, nearly all of which will remain closed.Councils are urging shoppers to take extra care when visiting high streets and town centres to avoid a second spike in coronavirus infections.The District Councils’ Network, which represents local authorities, said it wanted the public to be reassured that safety measures would be in place for them to follow.To make visits to town centres and high streets safe, councils are carrying out more frequent street cleaning, providing hand-sanitiser posts, adapting public seating and conveniences, creating more pedestrianised spaces and streets and deploying council staff or volunteers to provide help and advice.Government ministers have also tried their best to give people the confidence to return to high streets and shopping centres. Small business minister Paul Scully told BBC Breakfast: The high street is going to be a different place to what it was before, with the one-way systems, with the hand sanitisers, and with people not trying clothes on in the same way. He echoed Boris Johnson who said on Sunday that people should shop and shop with confidence.Shops have been asked to encourage customers to shop alone unless they need extra assistance and to adjust routes around stores to minimise congestion.Given the constraints in place, retailers face a tough challenge encouraging some reluctant consumers back into stores.While there is likely to be some pent-up demand as people have the chance to browse and shop in a way they have not been able to since March, millions of consumers remain wary of public spaces while others are concerned about their finances.What are the lockdown rules now and what can you do from today?Indications from other countries is that footfall on high streets will, unsurprisingly, increase as shops reopen but that this may not translate into sales.That puts Britain’s struggling high streets in an even more perilous position as shops face high costs on rents and wages, for example, but greatly reduced revenues.David Fox, co-head of retail at property advisors Colliers, said: “Due to the social distancing measures and strict government protocols that retailers need to adhere to, there will be a mismatch of customers desire to shop and businesses ability to meet the demand. “The difficulty for retailers will be the logistics of the new health, safety and hygiene policies within the stores, with skeleton staffing to manage queueing and perform their sales duties.”Those shoppers who do venture out may be able to pick up bargains, particularly if they can hold off on purchases for a couple of weeks.Primark revealed recently that it had £1.9bn-worth of items in stock, more than double the amount it would usually hold. By one estimate, fashion retailers have around £15bn of unsold garments. Shoppers may be able to take advantage of heavy discounts as chains try to sell this excess before it falls out of fashion.However, some experts think retailers will hold off before slashing prices. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at consultancy firm PwC said it was unlikely that consumers would see “wall-to-wall sales” this week.Many retailers have already offered big discounts online, with promotions reaching levels normally only seen on Black Friday.Ms Hooker predicts a bounce in sales this month. “If June trading does not make a big enough dent in stocks, we predict a rush of promotions and sales later in the summer.”Oxfam says charity shops are likely to be packed with “gems” as they reopen this week and fill up with items that people have cleared out during lockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This could be due to the delay between people experiencing symptoms and people being tested for Covid-19.Google has previously attempted to predict such trends through its nowcast function, which launched in 2008. A paper published in the scientific journal Nature at the time explained how people\u0027s search patterns could estimate flu prevalence two weeks before it was registered by official bodies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As the world\u0027s most popular online search engine, the data from people\u0027s digital footprints offered potentially life-saving insights and it was the poster child of so-called \u0027Big Data\u0027. But by 2015 it was shut down after it failed to foresee a massive flu outbreak in 2013.UK now has more daily Covid-19 deaths than the rest of Europe combinedIt was described by some publications as an epic failure and a note on its landing page now states: Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends are no longer publishing current estimates of Flu and Dengue fever based on search patterns...  It is still early days for nowcasting and similar tools for understanding the spread of diseases like flu and dengue – we\u0027re excited to see what comes next.A blog post explaining the decision said that Google would work directly with academic institutions to make sense of the search data. More than 265 peer-reviewed papers have since drawn on aggregated data taken from Google searches, used to track epidemics like Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and West Nile fever over several years in Italy.

Only, as a last resort, will officers use enforcement.” Lizzie Dearden reports:Four in five London transport users wore face coveringAround four out of five Tube and bus users in London wore a face covering on the first day of their becoming compulsory\u0026nbspon public transport in England, the city\u0027s transport commissioner said.Mike Brown told PA that the response of passengers had exceeded his expectations.\u0026nbspHe said: More than 80 per cent\u0026nbsp(compliance) is what we\u0027re seeing in observations.In some places it\u0027s higher, 85-90 per cent. Certainly quite a significant uptake.\u0026nbspFor the first day, I\u0027m really pleased the way passengers are responding as I would have expected them to do so.Science will guide 2-metre rule, minister insistsDominic\u0026nbspRaab\u0026nbspinsisted a decision on whether to reduce the two-metre rule would be underpinned by science.\u0026nbspThe foreign secretary told the Downing Street press conference: There\u0027s no magic to one or other particular measure, there will be different levels of risk whether it\u0027s at two metres, one-and-a-half metres or one metre.As we bring the incidence and the transmission rate down, depending on the setting, it\u0027s something that can be looked at.We are still going to make sure that all of the policy judgments that we rightly as politicians take and are accountable for are underpinned by the science.BAME risk study \u0027needs more research\u0027More research is needed before Public Health England findings into the risk of Covid-19 to black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities can be released, foreign secretary Dominc Raab says.When asked why the government had not published the report, which was leaked last week, Dominic\u0026nbspRaab\u0026nbspsaid: We do want to get to the bottom of that - we\u0027ve commissioned more research on it.I think you\u0027d agree that needs to be handled very sensitively but we are making sure we get to the bottom of it and that we\u0027ve got a clear view before we advise the public.Pressed on why it was not being published immediately, he\u0026nbspadded: It is not right, this subject is sensitive where we have not got to the bottom of all the evidence to start leaking snippets out.We want to make sure we\u0027ve got a clearer understanding so we can communicate it with practical advice for those involved, precisely because it is a very sensitive issue and we want to give clear and reassuring guidance and not to have different people saying different things.We will release as much evidence as we can as soon as we practically can.Raab defends \u0027careful approach\u0027 in face of risk of second spikeThe government had to take a careful approach to reopening the economy, foreign secretary Dominic Raab has insisted.\u0026nbspWe can\u0027t just pretend coronavirus has gone away and we have eliminated the virus, he told the Downing Street press conference.We know from the science, and also what we are seeing from international experience, that there is a risk of a second spike if we are not very careful at this moment of time.So we need to keep up the social distancing, we need to keep building up and reinforcing the test-and-trace regime and we need to continue our steady progress in repressing the virus as we try to get life back to something like normal.\u0026nbspHalf of people shielding have left home against adviceUp to half of people who are vulnerable to Covid-19 and shielding have left their home against advice, while a third have seen their mental health worsen, data suggests.Figures from the Office for National Statistics, based on a survey of 4,149 people who are shielding, found that 49 per cent\u0026nbsphave been out since shielding began, while 51 per cent\u0026nbsphave stayed at home.People who are shielding were initially told not to leave their home or garden, including for exercise, shopping or to go to work.\u0026nbspBut on 1 June, the rules in England were relaxed to say people could leave their homes once a day for exercise.The new poll across England found that two-thirds (66 per cent) had\u0026nbspnot stayed two metres away from those they live with despite being advised to do so, while only 11 per cent\u0026nbsphave always kept their distance.At least a quarter - 26 per cent - had\u0026nbspattended a GP or hospital appointment and 24 per cent had\u0026nbspshopped for essentials\u0026nbsp12 per cent\u0026nbspcollected a prescription, 11 per cent\u0026nbsphad a blood test and 3 per cent\u0026nbspwent to work.Paris restaurants cautiously reopen their interiorsParisian restaurants cautiously reopened their indoor dining halls on Monday as the government relaxed one of the last major coronavirus constraints, but with virtually no tourists and many French people still working from home, the mood was cautious.President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday that restaurants and cafes in Paris could reopen fully from Monday, the same day France lifted border restrictions for European Union travellers, bringing much needed relief for the hospitality industry.Restaurants outside the Paris region were allowed to open again from June 2, but in the city, where the virus struck hardest, venues could only serve customers on outdoor terraces.At Le Mesturet, a bistrot between the Opera Garnier and the Louvre museum, owner Alain Fontaine said it was a relief to reopen, but he warned that without tourists and with many people still teleworking, restaurants should not operate at full capacity in order to avoid the risk of bankruptcies.“I am sure that by end of summer everybody will have reopened, but it may take six months to a year before business fully recovers to like it was before,” he said.ReutersEurope\u0027s borders begin opening upBorders opened up across Europe on Monday after three months of coronavirus closures that began chaotically in March. But many restrictions persist, it\u0027s unclear how keen Europeans will be to travel this summer and the continent is still closed to Americans, Asians and other international tourists.Border checks for most Europeans were dropped overnight in Germany, France and elsewhere, nearly two weeks after Italy opened its frontiers. The European Union\u0027s 27 nations, as well as those in the Schengen passport-free travel area, which also includes a few non-EU nations such as Switzerland, aren\u0027t expected to start opening to visitors from outside the continent until at least the beginning of next month, and possibly later.Announcing Monday\u0027s reopening of borders and Paris restaurants, French President Emmanuel Macron said it\u0027s time “to turn the page of the first act of the crisis” and “rediscover our taste for freedom.”But he warned: “This doesn\u0027t mean the virus has disappeared and we can totally let down our guard. ... The summer of 2020 will be a summer unlike any other.”That caution is widespread after more than 182,000 virus-linked deaths in Europe.The region has had more than 2 million of the world\u0027s 7.9 million confirmed infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.APPlease allow the blog a moment to loadNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.A Covid-19 vaccine that is being developed by scientists at Imperial College London could be made available to the British population for as little as £3 per person.The university is working on one of two bids in the UK to develop a form of immunisation against coronavirus, along with Oxford University’s Jenner Institute.Robin Shattock, a professor of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College, and his team of researchers are making use of RNA technology that would allow the vaccine to be manufactured on a mass but affordable scale.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Imperial College vaccine, which takes a “small portion” of genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, delivers instructions to the body’s muscle cells to make the “spike” protein seen on the surface of coronavirus.In theory, the presence of this protein will provoke an immune response and the production of antibodies, thereby offering protection against Covid-19. How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThere is no need to grow the live virus when manufacturing an RNA vaccine, making it safer to manufacture. And importantly, only small quantities of the pathogen – a thousandth of a thousandth of a gram of its genetic coding, or RNA – are used for gene sequencing and vaccine testing.A litre’s worth would therefore provide enough material for 200 million people, according to Professor Shattock. “It really is a tiny dose,” he told The Times. “That’s very good from a safety point of view but also in terms of production — it makes it much easier to scale up.He estimates that enough vaccine could be made for the UK for around £200 million. “That’s roughly £3 for each person to be immune, assuming it works. That’s really good value.”Researchers believe that two shots will be needed to provide immunity against Covid-19.Whereas Oxford University has licensed its vaccine to pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to help scale-up manufacturing, the Imperial College team will produce their vaccine as part of the joint social enterprise VacEquity Global Health (VGH), in partnership with Morningside Ventures investment firm.Imperial and VGH will waive royalties for the UK and low-income countries “and charge only modest cost-plus prices to sustain the enterprise’s work, accelerate global distribution and support new research”, the university said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailProfessor Shattock’s team is continuing to rely on public funding for its research. Last month, it received £18.5m from the government for trials and manufacturing, and a further £5m has come from philanthropic sources.“We’ve already kind of put everything in place to be able to use for the UK and we hope that the government will act on wanting to purchase that, and we’re working with other partners around the world do that,” Professor Shattock told The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.“We have a very different model to AstraZeneca. If you like we want to be almost the Microsoft of the vaccine world where we make the genetic code, we pass that to other manufacturers and give them a sub licence so that they can then use their hardware to manufacture the vaccine in different parts of the globe.”While the Oxford vaccine has already entered into the latter stages of the clinical pathway, researchers at Imperial started their own human trials on Monday.A further trial involving 6,000 people is planned for October and if these prove successful, Imperial hopes the vaccine could be distributed in the UK and abroad early next year.Professor Shattock said his team’s vaccine would not be available by Christmas but “in the first two quarters of next year if things go extraordinarily well”.“At the moment there is a lot of speculation and we really need to deal with facts and data rather than over-promising and under-delivering,” he told the Royal Society of Medicine last week.Professor Shattock said that his team had been collaborating with scientists at Oxford University in sharing data and results.“We are not trying to beat each other.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo? You’ll find plenty of of delicious ideas from the likes of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Amanda Grant at vegpower.org.uk. You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose. I do all kinds of areas of work but one of them is to make crowds of people.Created with Sketch.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing.

He printed a copy of the photo and sent it to his grandfather along with a letter.Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic falls into administrationThe photo is dated 1913 but auctioneers say Capt Wood’s letter corroborates the image.He wrote in the letter: “I am sending you a sea picture, the Etonian running before a gale and the iceberg that sank the Titanic.“We crossed the ice tracks 40hrs before her and in daylight so saw the ice easily and I got a picture.”He wrote a caption in black ink on the photo, noting “iceberg taken by Captain Wood SS Etonian in 41°50N 49°50W April 12th at 4pm”.The Titanic struck an iceberg at 10.20pm on 14 April and sank several hours later, claiming some 1,522 lives.The photo and the letter are now being sold at auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wilts, for an estimated £12,000 ($15,000).No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

John Lewis was reopening two branches on Monday, while Argos was due to open just 145 out of more than 800 stores.Primark is taking a different approach, reopening all of its 153 stores. The budget clothing specialist has been hit harder than most by the lockdown as it does not have an online storefront, meaning goods have been left stacked up in warehouses or on shelves. JD Sports is reopening all 309 of its branches on Monday.Certain shops face particular challenges in complying with government guidance, such as shoe retailers which now have to “quarantine” pairs that customers have tried on. Changing rooms at most clothes shops will remain closed while bookshops have said they will take items off shelves after people have touched them. Waterstones will only return items to the shop floor after 72 hours.Shops are required to install screens at checkouts and mark two-metre distance intervals on the floor to help customers stay apart. Retailers including Ikea and John Lewis have introduced social distancing wardens to help with this.As with supermarkets, numbers within non-essential stores will be strictly limited, meaning shoppers will be faced with queues outside.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailRichard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, forecasts that shopping centres will be slower to reopen than high streets because people will prefer to shop in local, familiar, open-air environments, rather than travel to large complexes.He pointed out that shopping centres often attracted consumers looking for a day out by offering an array of food options and other leisure experiences, nearly all of which will remain closed.Councils are urging shoppers to take extra care when visiting high streets and town centres to avoid a second spike in coronavirus infections.The District Councils’ Network, which represents local authorities, said it wanted the public to be reassured that safety measures would be in place for them to follow.To make visits to town centres and high streets safe, councils are carrying out more frequent street cleaning, providing hand-sanitiser posts, adapting public seating and conveniences, creating more pedestrianised spaces and streets and deploying council staff or volunteers to provide help and advice.Government ministers have also tried their best to give people the confidence to return to high streets and shopping centres. Small business minister Paul Scully told BBC Breakfast: The high street is going to be a different place to what it was before, with the one-way systems, with the hand sanitisers, and with people not trying clothes on in the same way. He echoed Boris Johnson who said on Sunday that people should shop and shop with confidence.Shops have been asked to encourage customers to shop alone unless they need extra assistance and to adjust routes around stores to minimise congestion.Given the constraints in place, retailers face a tough challenge encouraging some reluctant consumers back into stores.While there is likely to be some pent-up demand as people have the chance to browse and shop in a way they have not been able to since March, millions of consumers remain wary of public spaces while others are concerned about their finances.What are the lockdown rules now and what can you do from today?Indications from other countries is that footfall on high streets will, unsurprisingly, increase as shops reopen but that this may not translate into sales.That puts Britain’s struggling high streets in an even more perilous position as shops face high costs on rents and wages, for example, but greatly reduced revenues.David Fox, co-head of retail at property advisors Colliers, said: “Due to the social distancing measures and strict government protocols that retailers need to adhere to, there will be a mismatch of customers desire to shop and businesses ability to meet the demand. “The difficulty for retailers will be the logistics of the new health, safety and hygiene policies within the stores, with skeleton staffing to manage queueing and perform their sales duties.”Those shoppers who do venture out may be able to pick up bargains, particularly if they can hold off on purchases for a couple of weeks.Primark revealed recently that it had £1.9bn-worth of items in stock, more than double the amount it would usually hold. By one estimate, fashion retailers have around £15bn of unsold garments. Shoppers may be able to take advantage of heavy discounts as chains try to sell this excess before it falls out of fashion.However, some experts think retailers will hold off before slashing prices. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at consultancy firm PwC said it was unlikely that consumers would see “wall-to-wall sales” this week.Many retailers have already offered big discounts online, with promotions reaching levels normally only seen on Black Friday.Ms Hooker predicts a bounce in sales this month. “If June trading does not make a big enough dent in stocks, we predict a rush of promotions and sales later in the summer.”Oxfam says charity shops are likely to be packed with “gems” as they reopen this week and fill up with items that people have cleared out during lockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption.

Publishers and developers will choose whether to implement it on their games, meaning that some third-party titles could have to be bought twice, if those making them decide so.It means that if anyone buys a game now – such as Gears 5 – for the current generation of Xbox, all they will have to do is push a button on their Xbox Series X when it is released to download the version of the title fully updated and optimised for the new console.Xbox Series X will be \u0027most compatible console ever\u0027, says MicrosoftLikewise, players will be able to buy Halo Infinite when it comes out alongside the Xbox Series X, and play it on both the new console they may put in their living room as well as the Xbox One that may be demoted to the bedroom, Microsoft noted.Not all games will be ready when the new version of the Xbox is released. Microsoft pointed to the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077, for instance, which will be released in September that will not be optimised for the Xbox Series X at launch, but players will be able to play it on their new console in compatibility mode until the fully optimised version arrives later on.All of those games will allow saved games and progress to move forward onto the new console, too, meaning that players will be able to pick up where they started on the previous generation.Microsoft gave a brief list of all the games that are optimised for Xbox Series X and are confirmed to support smart delivery, which included Halo Infinite and Cyberpunk 2077.

Our scientists doubled it for good measure.Fair enough, perhaps, when infections were soaring.Not now that less than one in , people in England — and falling fast — has Covid.Yes, the virus can kill in extreme circumstances.But our chances of getting it are tiny at two metres and STILL tiny at one.Especially with routine mask use.International studies show reopening schools has barely any effect on increasing infections, among kids or adults.The Government is on the ropes, only prepared to make timid and incremental changes which lead to chaotic and baffling new rules like the new “bubbles” for people living alone.It simply has to be bolder, starting by relaxing the two-metre rule.Now, before it does any more damage.IT’S quite the confession.The same Sage scientists who unanimously advised the Government against an earlier lockdown now say it came too late and may have killed thousands.What, then, should Boris have decided after receiving that advice on March  Perhaps he should have told Britain’s finest epidemiologists: “You clueless clowns don’t know what you’re talking about”, as his prominent critics apparently believe.Instead he deferred to their expertise.Imagine the howling rage of Remainer MPs, journalists and punditsthis Vote Leave Government had not done so.These same champions of hindsight — who had a hissy-fit both over Dominic Cummings attending Sage meetings and over Boris attending too few — now suggest No dithered. But they didn’t.The advice was clear and unanimous.

So it is extremely confusing why Prince Andrew is resisting demands to meet US officials probing convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.Department of Justice investigators want to speak to Andrew as a witness. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in August last year, taking many of his depraved secrets to the grave.Despite this, Andrew has, according to US prosecutors, “repeatedly declined” a request to be interviewed and had “unequivocally” stated he would not come in for one.Instead, his lawyers say he has offered to provide a witness statement, which is not quite the same.Although I guess he knows that already, having submitted to the car crash Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, during which he kept digging the hole he was in.If Andrew has got nothing to hide about his relationship with Jeffery Epstein, why did he request to communicate with the FBI through a written statement Friends of the duke this week claimed he was “utterly bewildered” by accusations that he was refusing to help US investigators.But it all just feels a bit . . . murky, doesn’t it He should jump at the chance of properly explaining his relationship with Epstein and his close friend Ghislaine Maxwell.She has been accused of acting as a pimp for Epstein — which her lawyers have denied — and has vanished.No doubt the duke has spent the past few months hoping this story will just go away, or be eclipsed by other, bigger news events. But clearly, this story is going nowhere.The bottom line is thatthe authorities in the US want to interview him, he must speak to them.Then he can repair his reputation and that of the wider Royal Family.He needs to restore the public’s trust in him. In his Newsnight interview he referred to himself, repeatedly, as “honourable”.Well, now is the time to prove it. Just step up, do the FBI interview and get it over and done with.And in all of this furore, let’s not forget Epstein’s victims. If Prince Andrew can shed any light on Epstein, who killed himself before he could go to trial for new sex trafficking charges, then why won’t he Perhaps he feels that, as a member of the Royal Family, he should not be subject to the same kind of scrutiny as “ordinary” people.But that line of thinking won’t cut the mustard in light of the seriousness of the allegations about Epstein — and those who benefitted from spending time with him.Anyone who watched the documentary about victim Virginia Roberts, Epstein and Prince Andrew will agree that it seems unlikely that anyone who knew Epstein would have known something was not right.I knowI had seen what is alleged, I would have walked straight out and to the first police station.But perhaps he can persuade prosecutors otherwise. And anyway, what is plain to see is that Andrew will only get his le back once he has answered some questions and cleared his name.In the meantime, though, I have another, possibly more pressing question that I would like answered: Where the hell has Ghislaine Maxwell disappeared to, and why is she not being interviewed about her role in all of this A good education closes the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The better your education, the more career choices you have.So when schools closed in March and we were all told to stay at home, a plan for how to reopen them should have been an absolute priority from day one.But schools are still closed to most children – indefinitely and with no firm or credible plan for them to reopen, even in September.We can go to Thorpe Park. We can go to Ikea. But our children cannot go to school.In the meantime, an estimated , kids are currently doing no school-work at all.No one disagrees that lockdown should have included schools. But they need to reopen as soon as it is safe to do so.That might mean cutting class sizes from  to . It might mean half-days for children or twice as many classrooms and teachers, plus proper arrangements for social-distancing.These things all need managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help with the logistics This is a national crisis and it is turning into a national emergency, as the gulf between the haves and have-nots widens.Of course, some families will not be comfortable sending their children to school. If that is the case, it should be their choice not to send them.But we need to get schools open again, fast.I had a little chuckle while reading the interview with Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett.With her four children and long-standing marriage, she seemingly has it all.But I loved her honesty about the reality of home-schooling her kids while also trying to work during lockdown.Cate said: “I know, as a working mother who identies as a feminist . . . it’s a very rare partnership where the men also accept that responsibility in making things work.”She added that her husband, Andrew Upton, bought her a vacuum cleaner for their first anniversary and has also given her a mixer and an ironing board.It could have been me talking, except I wasn’t given a vacuum cleaner.I was given a frying pan.A hospital costs about £million but without doctors and nurses there is no point.So perhaps I would suggest the money goes towards emergency funding to train hospital staff.What would NOT be on my list, though, is a new royal yacht. Yet that is exactly what former trade minister Lord Digby Jones has called for, to lt the nation’s spirits in the wake of the Covid- lockdown.Somehow, I doubt the Queen – who famously uses Tupperware to keep her breakfast cereal fresh – would agree that a new yacht is what is needed in these tough economic times.She might deserve it but wouldn’t want it.There are so many reasons to love the flute-playing American rapper Lizzo.This week she gave us another, with a tweet showing footage of her working out in many dferent guises.A voiceover said: “I’ve been working out consistently for the past five years – and it may come as a surprise to some of y’all that I’m not working out to have your ideal body type.“I’m working out to have MY ideal body type.“And you know what that is  None of your fing business. Because I am beautul. I am strong. I do my job.”I love this message, which is true in so many ways. I really hope women, young and old, take note. Love yourself and, seriously, don’t give a rat’s a what anyone  thinks.Litter – and worse.One green space near me has a sign up saying: “This is a park, not a toilet.”What happened to us during lockdown that we think it is OK to behave like this  Come on, people. We can do better.Having said that, maybe the council needs to put out some more bins.In the Nineties, it seemed barely a day went by without front-page shots of Kate Moss looking worse for wear after a night on the tiles.But those days are gone and there is something strangely comforting about Kate, who is now teetotal, needing to be in bed by pm so she gets her eight hours.Maybe that’s why she still looks so good. She spent years being there and doing that – now it’s time to get her beauty sleep.Not drinking has many benefits. I feel so much better at the end of Dry January than I do end after boozy December. Good for her.It was heartwarming to see Prince Philip in such fine fettle as he turned  last week.I love how dapper he still is. And he has good health, a strong marriage and great wit – le goals for all of us.I do hope he will be celebrating his th birthday – and beyond.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was so excited for them to hatch but I still had in the back of my mind that these are supermarket eggs.They have been collected, bashed around on a delivery truck, then rattled around on a trolley onto a shelf, picked up and put down by who knows how many people, so they still might not go all the way.Charli was shocked when the ducklings did hatch - and said the experience with the cutest little balls of fluff had been amazing.The only reason I could try was because Im currently furloughed and have the time to raise them to an age where they wont need me all day, she said.Under normal circumstances it wouldnt have been possible or fair on them.A spokeswoman for Clarence Court Farms said: It is a feat of remarkably slim odds that a duckling has been hatched. But we acknowledge that its not impossible.Officials from Waitrose say fertilised eggs were safe to eat and entirely indistinguishable from normal eggs, unless incubated.Our farmers work hard to ensure ducks and drakes are separated correctly, the spokesperson said.As a result of this dficulty in sexing, a male white-feathered duck may very occasionally be left with a group of females, although, these instances are extremely rare.There may also be instances when a wild duck encounters farmed drakes, but again, this is rare.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the new book, serialised in the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Mail on Sunday, it is revealed that some lions are deboned while they are still ALIVE because it gives the skeleton a lucrative pink colour – caused by blood being left in the bones. Unfair Game details a covert operation by security services, including ex-British soldiers, to expose the vile industry by using a dealer as an undercover “double agent.” One of the most serious claims by ex-Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft is that the lions which are born into captivity are raised in such disgusting conditions that they could spread fatal diseases such as tuberculosis and botulism. Dr Peter Caldwell, a wildle vet in Pretoria, said botulism – an infection which attacks the nervous system – could spread to people through infected bones and skin. He said: “If that lion dies from botulism, the people who bred it won’t waste that animal by burying it or burning it. Instead, they will put it into the lion bone and skin trade. “And the toxin remains in the body, so the people who utilise that lion can die a miserable, painful death.”Other diseases spread by lion bones include brucellosis - an infection that causes arthritis and inflammation of the heart - and tuberculosis, which killed . million people globally in .Another shocking claim in the book is that a rich Russian paid one of the farms to let his bloodthirsty pack of hunting dogs savage one of the caged lions to death. When Lord Ashcroft’s lead investigator, who carried out an eight-month probe, presented his evidence to a South African police chief it was rejected and he was told he was “lucky” he was not in jail. The book estimates there are at least , lions, bred in captivity in South Africa, compared to just , in the wild. Sick farm bosses let wealthy hunters into the enclosures to kill the big cats for sport in so-called “canned hunts” which result in , lion deaths every year. Investigators also found that poachers hunt and kill wild lions in neighbouring Botswana by poisoning or shooting them in the stomachs to protect the precious bones. A lion skeleton is worth up to £,. And in sick markets in Johannesburg, lion bones and skins are sold alongside exotic animals such as pangolins – a creature which has been linked to Covid-.Lord Ashcroft writes: So are we sleep-walking straight into a new major public health crisis with the lion bone industry at its core  I fear we are. It could be a surge in a disease that already exists, or it could be a new and frightening infection, just like Covid- was.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The prince has long faced questions about his friendship with financier Epstein, who killed himself in August while awaiting trial on federal charges for the sex trafficking of minors. He was widely criticised for a November interview with the BBCs Emily Maitlis for, among other things, saying he didnt regret the association because it had helped him make contacts that proved useful for his work as a royal. Speaking to the Sunday Times, a source close to the duke said: “I don’t think he regrets the intention behind the interview, which was to clear the air for his family, the royal family and the institution. But the fact he was unable to appropriately or sufficiently convey his sympathy for the victims of Epstein, is of course a source of regret.”Virgina Roberts, who claims she had sex with Andrew aged  after being trafficked by Epstein, took to twitter to respond to the reports. Oh the gull of this toad - he regrets the BBC interview but not his friendship with Epstein because it gave him great contacts and much more, she wrote. This man is not a prince but a facet of insidiousness who has proven to get away with it all.Prince Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing. Recent weeks have also seen the princes legal team engage in a war of words with FBI prosecutors leading the probe into Epsteins crimes. Each side has publicly blamed the other for the fact Andrew is yet to be questioned at part of the investigation. It was reported last week that the US Department of Justice had submitted a formal request to the Home Office for assistance in speaking with Andrew as a witness. The dukes team responded by claiming he had offered his assistance as a witness to the DoJ on at least three occasions since the start of this year, and that the DoJ had breached its own confidentiality rules.Lead federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman said in response that the prince ly [seeking to] portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate. The prince has... repeatedly declined our request to schedule... an interview and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally... that he would not come in for such an interview, Berman said.The duke is now reported to be unwilling to help with the probe unless US officials begin to work more honourably. A source close to Andrew told the Sunday Times: “The duke is not going any further in the co-operation process... unless [the DoJ offer] some kind of olive branch to rebuild trust.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My focus, however, has been on exposing those who raise captive-bred lions, either for their bones or as so-called “trophies” in “canned” hunts, where the lion — sometimes semi-tame and drugged — is shot in an enclosed area with no chance of escape.In an exclusive interview to mark the publication of my new book Unfair Game: An Exposé Of South Africa’s Captive-Bred Lion Industry, which is out tomorrow, Kevin, , spoke about his determination to make a dference.He said he is now prouder of his off-the-pitch exploits relating to wildle than of his cricketing achievements.“I am pleased that I found something that I am keen to do but also I think it is so much greater than any achievement I had on the cricket field,” he said.Sitting in a private room at the Wentworth Club in Surrey, close to his family home, Kevin told me that his love of wild animals stems from his childhood.He was born in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, in  to an Afrikaner father and an English mother .He said: “A lot of people talk about ‘you are not born in Africa, Africa is born in you’, and that’s so true.“As an African kid, as a boy of the soil, I appreciated what was in the country. And wildle was right up there.”As a youngster, Kevin and his three brothers were taken on safari by his parents to the Kruger National Park in South Africa.“We saw some pretty amazing sights,” he said. His passion for wildle continued during his cricket career, when he often went on safari with family and friends to enjoy watching the “big five”  —  lion, leopard, rhino, elephant and African buffalo.However, his attitude to wildle underwent a major change when he travelled with two friends to South Africa in .Kevin said: “I had just finished with England. After playing a charity game, we went to a couple of safari lodges and went on a rhino micro-chipping experience, where you chip the horn for tracking purposes andthe rhino is poached. Only then did I appreciate what was happening to this beautul, iconic species.“So from  my focus and drive shted away from the international sporting buzz to a much-needed and much more necessary conservation plan. I realised quite what an issue rhino-poaching was, and I realised that I could make a dference by raising awareness, by raising money and by being a voice for an animal that has no voice.“So since  I have been banging the drum about what’s happening in Africa. I can’t tell you how many people now approach me to talk about conservation and not about cricket. The change has been fabulous. To sht from being identied as a familiar face through sport to going into a dferent world where people love animals is something I am incredibly proud of.”As well as establishing a luxury lodge on the edge of the Kruger National Park, Kevin has founded campaign group Save Our Rhino Africa India .It works to help prevent poaching for rhino horn, care for injured and orphaned rhino and to educate people about the fact that the five species of rhino face extinction, with fewer than , left in Africa and Asia.In Africa alone, there are fewer than , white rhinos and for black rhinos the number is below ,. Father-of-two Kevin, who is married to former Liberty X singer Jessica Taylor, spoke emotionally about his love for rhinos: “What is Africa without one of the ‘big five’  What is the world without one of the ‘big five’  That is why the rhino, which is crucially endangered, means so much to me. I just have this love affair with this animal that we are desperate to save.”Kevin is realistic when it comes to the occasional need to kill wild animals.While he strongly opposes trophy-hunting and the hunting of endangered species, he considers that hunting for food and culling wildle can both be legitimate in certain circumstances.“I am just a vocal campaigner on things I don’t think are right, whether it be bullying or plastics in the ocean or protecting wildle,” he said.Many of his strong views, including his anger towards trophy hunters, are aired on his Twitter feed, where he has .million followers.On Twitter, Kevin has highlighted my own wildle work.Last year, I revealed the full horrors of “lion farming” in South Africa, where some , captive lions are bred either for their bones — largely to serve an Asian market — or as “trophies”, most killed in the pretence of a “hunt”.In Africa, captive-bred lions now outnumber wild lions by around four to one. I asked Kevin whether he is ashamed of how some people in the country of his birth abuse lions, the so-called “King Of The Jungle.”He replied: “Absolutely right. I do not understand the end game, the end user, the person that pulls the trigger. I do not understand how you would want to take money out of your pocket to shoot an animal that has been born and raised to be shot.“I don’t understand the brain inside the head that says ‘Look at me in this photo’ [next to a dead wild animal — known as the ‘kill shot’]. It’s just not a space that I live in. It’s just not a world that I live in.“It’s pretty disgusting really to do such a thing. In this trophy photo, you see they [the so-called hunters] are smiling or laughing next to this majestic animal. For me it’s an absolute no-go.”Kevin said that he has long been aware that lion farming and canned hunting exist in South Africa. “It is something that can be stopped and should be stopped.“The human race doesn’t surprise me any more and that’s such a sad thing to say. There are some filthy people out there that don’t have any feeling for animals.”Like me, Kevin wants the UK Government to change the law so that body parts of endangered species can no longer be imported into the country.“I am  per cent against this importation,” he said.Kevin is disappointed the South African government and police have so far refused to act on information I supplied from two undercover investigations which I commissioned.These resulted in my team secretly filming, and eventually identying, many of those guilty of criminal offences. Yet Kevin is not that surprised by the inaction.“In all honestly, South Africa has such big issues — lack of electricity, blood-shedding, corruption within the government who have been looting the country for so many years, that I don’t think this wildle issue is high on their agendaI can be brutally honest,” he said, speaking shortly before the coronavirus pandemic.My respect for Kevin and his work is immense. Unlike many talented sportsman whose careers end because of age or injury, he has a real purpose to his le since retiring as a professional cricketer two years ago.“I did almost everything in the game of cricket, but being able to be a huge voice and a campaigner to try to keep a species alive is . . . something that I love,” he said. Kevin believes his work as a conservationist will be ongoing.“I don’t think it will ever be complete. Unfortunately these horrible people are seeing so much financial gain from killing these animals that it is going to take a lot of amazing people to constantly keep banging the drum to save our animals.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will draw on advice from scientic and medical experts as well as economists and papers from SAGE. It will take advice from a range of experts including the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser.It will be completed in the coming weeks.Cutting down the risk from two to one metre would crease ten times extra risk of catching coronavirus, experts say.But other studies show that the dference is marginal.The PM has said he wants to cut it when the number of incidents of the virus reduces - which would mean there would be a slimmer chance of catching it anyway.The review will be led by Simon Case- the permanent secretary at No.The PMs spokesperson confirmed that the opening date for pubs and hospitality businesses is still from July  meaning that there is just over two weeks to go.They said: We understand that they will want to get going again as soon as they possibly can.But we have a duty to ensure that when reopening does take place, its done in a safe way. But there is not yet confirmation that the July  reopening will yet go ahead. It could also be the case that pubs open with m social distancing in place and the rule reduces to one just weeks afterwards, sparking chaos for businesses.The British Beer  Pub Association , the leading trade association representing Britain’s brewers and pubs, has today demanded the UK Government give a clear date for when pubs can reopen.  Emma McClarkin, Chief Executive of the British Beer  Pub Association, told The Sun: If the Government can help in any way to go to a safe distance, as advised WHO, that will help our sector reopen.We need to know, it’s having a major impact on our preparations. We need to get clarity, immediately.Our pub are burning money - for every moment they remain closed –they are have to remain closed or they are not viable, they are burning away up to £m a month.The longer we have this waiting or preication on any decision making, the more likely it will be tens of thousands of job losses, and pubs will close their doors for good.Kevin Georgel, Chief Executive of St Austell Brewery, said: Like many other breweries we have been forced to take a signicant gamble and start brewing draught beer again to ensure that pubs can reopen on th July as per the Government roadmap. Cask Ale on average takes three weeks to brew and lager can often take longer. In order for pubs to be able to serve a pint of fresh draught beer that customers have longed for during lockdown, we had to start brewing last week. If pubs do not now open on th July, all of this beer will be lost at huge cost to us during this time of survival.The news comes after reports that the Governments top scientists were unhappy about having to shoulder the responsibility for the decision, and the Sunday Times claimed they were on resignation watch.The Government has repeatedly said it will be led by the science in making decisions about the coronavirus outbreak.Number  insisted there was not an issue in the Governments relations with the scientists who appear at the daily coronavirus press conferences.Last week the Governments Chief Scientic Adviser, Patrick Vallance said last week that the two metre advice was not a rule.He told the Downing Street briefing last week: “It is wrong to portray this as a scientic rule that says it is two metres or nothing – that is not what the advice has been and it is not what the advice is now.”Instead the decision is going to be taken by ministers, the Chancellor confirmed yesterday.It means it will be up to Boris to make the final decision.

They called on the Government to provide free school meals throughout the summer holidays to stop .million kids from going hungry. Free meal support was extended to Easter break and half term to help those kids struggling the most by giving them £ vouchers. The letter said: Access to the internet and technology has been vital during the lockdown.It has enabled many households to remain in contact with friends and family, to take part in online exercise classes, and to continue learning and studying despite the closure of schools.

Some children have been allowed toto school - with primary schools reopening for small groups of pupils in reception, year one and year six, and secondary schools opening today for children in year  and year .

He wrote: “The Government has taken a ‘whatever it takes’ approach to the economy - I’m asking you today to extend that same thinking to protecting all vulnerable children across England.“I encourage you to hear their pleas and find your humanity. Please reconsider your decision to cancel the food voucher scheme over the summer holiday and guarantee the extension.“This is England in , and this is an issue that needs urgent assistance.“Please, while the eyes of the nation are on you, make the U-turn and make protecting the lives of some of our most vulnerable a top priority.”Rashford previously revealed how his family relied on breakfast clubs and free school meals as a child, and does not want other children to miss out.A spokesperson for the Department for Education saidfree school meals would not be given out during the holidays. They said: As schools open more widely, and their kitchesn reopen, we expect schools to make food parcels available for collection or delivery for any children that are eligible for free school meals who are not yet able toto school. Free school meals are ordinarily term-time only, and the national voucher scheme will not run during the summer holidays.

For the first time in three months youaposll be able to go clothes shopping and see the lemurs. But there will be strict social distancing rules in place and firms will be ordered to carry out more hygiene measures than usual. Expect queues outside shops and high demand for tickets for attractions allowed to reopen. Meanwhile, people who live alone or single parents are allowed to form a bubble with one other household in England. This means breaking the two-metre rule for the first time to hug and kiss, share childcare, stay the night and have sexthataposs your thing. Hereaposs everything you need to know about the lockdown changes this week. Two separate households in England can now join together in a “support bubble” under certain conditions. They won’t need to follow the two-metre rule - meaning they can hug, kiss, share childcare and meals, hang out indoors, stay the night and even have sex for the first time since March . One of the two households in each bubble must be a “single-adult household”. This means either a person who lives alone, or a single parent who lives with children under . There’s an incredible £million of funding from The National Lottery being shared among good causes around the UK – and it’s all thanks to you. Le’s been harder than ever for young carers in lockdown. But charities like TEN North East are offering vital support thanks to National Lottery funding. Program lead Levi Cosker  says: One mother calls our project a leline – without us she wouldn’t have any support. Click here to read her amazing full story. Visit national-lottery news to learn more about how you’re helping. The other household they are joining with can be of any size, and can have more than one adult in it. However, in total each bubble must only consist of two households - and each household must keep the arrangement “exclusive”. That means a person living alone cannot form multiple bubbles with multiple households. Likewise, a family cannot form multiple bubbles with more than one lonely relative.

What changes in England from June  Non-essential shops reopen  Non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen for the first time for almost three months in England. Stories will need strict social distancing measures, much like those weaposve already seen in supermarkets and other essential stores. Brands vowing to reopen bang on time from June  include Primark, GAME, Debenhams, O, EE and BT, HM, Lush, GAME, H Samuel and Argos. John Lewis is set to open most stores from June , while Next will open a handful followed by others in the coming weeks. Types of shop allowed to reopen include:Fashion shops Charity shops Betting shops and arcades Tailors, dress fitters and fashion designers Auction houses Antique stores Retail art galleries Photography studios Gt shops and retail spaces in theatres, museums, libraries, heritage sites and tourism sites Mobile phone stores Craft fairsFace coverings will be mandatory on public transport  Everyone travelling on public transport in England will be required to wear a face covering from June . Wearing a face covering - not a surgical mask - will be part of the conditions of carriage for travelling on public transport. That means travellers could be refused permission to board buses or trainsthey refuse to comply with the order. Serious offenders could be fined, but ministers have claimed people will largely comply and this wonapost be needed.  Hospital visitors and staff will need to wear face coverings and masks All hospital visitors and outpatients in England will be required to wear face coverings - while all hospital staff will be required to wear higher-grade, type  or  surgical masks. Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemasstart to re-open  Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas are set to reopen in England from Monday. Boris Johnson has said they can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. That means their on-site cafes and restaurants are expected to operate as take-away only. Only outdoor attractions are allowed to reopen, so reptile houses and indoor aquariums will remain closed. Sites will be operating at reduced capacity, and there may be one-way systems in place. And of course, because very few things are likely to be open it will be busy, you should book your ticket online in advance to ensure youaposre not disappointed when you turn up. Churches reopen but only for private prayer  Places of worship reopen in England from June , but only for private prayer and not for services. Iniduals are expected to be able to reflect and pray while adhering to social-distancing rules - but worship groups, weddings and other services will still not be permitted. In line with government guidance churches will be expected to be deep-cleaned regularly and should remove shared books from public areas. Churches have been closed since  March, following instructions from the Government. School pupils in Years  and a quarter at a time  Secondary schools in England can reopen for Years  and  from June , but not all students will be allowed toat the same time. Only a quarter of eligible pupils will be allowed in school at any one time - meaning schools have had to instigate special timetables and classes to make the system work. Secondary schools are not likely to fully reopen until September at the earliest. Students who dowill be encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. The teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue until the start of the summer holidays. Some primary schools will open a bit further than they are now While around half of the UKaposs primary schools have been open to more pupils from June , some have remained closed to all but key workersapos kids. This meant nursery, reception, year one and year six pupils in some parts of the country havenapost yet got back into the classroom. Some places, like Doncaster and Liverpool, stopped schools reopening on June , but will see them reopening their doors on Monday. Donapost expect more big changes to primary school attendance before September though. Plans for all pupils in Years , ,  and  tofor a month before the summer break in England have been dropped by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Instead schools are just being asked to bring back whoever they can, depending on capacity. He told MPs he is now aiming to get all children back to school in September,possible. What has already changed in recent weeks in EnglandJune : Primary schools were asked to reopen to years R,  and  in England - though only about half of them actually did June : People allowed to meet in socially-distanced groups of up to  outdoors, including in private gardens June : Car showrooms and outdoor markets allowed to reopen June : Dentists begin to reopen with extra hygiene measures in place June : -day quarantine comes into forced for those arriving in the UK June : Some parking charges that were suspended . What weaposll still need to wait until July for - or longer Pubs, restaurants and bars Pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes are not expected to reopen in England until July  at the earliest. They can already operate as takeaways - good news for pubs next to parks or beaches - but they canapost have people drinking on the premises, even in the beer garden. Pubs arenapost guaranteed to reopen on July  - thataposs just the starting date for the hospitality and leisure industry so boozers might come later. When they do open itaposll have to be with social distancing rules in place. Hairdressers and nail bars  Hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons are also only opening from July  at the earliest. And like pubs, the date could end up being later because itaposs hard to avoid being in close contact with someone cutting your hair. The two-metre rule Boris Johnson is under pressure to drop the two-metre social distancing rule down to one metre or one and a half. This would increase the risk of catching the virus from someone but allow the economy to restart. The government has made clear that the two-metre rule is still in all its guidance, including draft rules for pubs and cafes to reopen. But that could change in future. Boris Johnson has said he wants to cut the distance but only when itaposs supported by the science. In basic terms, that means waiting until your overall risk from catching the virus in wider society is so low, some extra risk from the person youaposre next to is acceptable. Scientists say youaposre  to  times more at risk from one metre away than two metres away.

David Lammy hit out after being asked by the BBC: Do you believe there is a thing called white privilege The campaigning MP explained the concept - and argued it was gaslighting to askprivilege or racism exist in Britain today.He went on to blast Boris Johnson for announcing a Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities - but burying it in an article about why Winston Churchillaposs statue should not be removed.Mr Lammy told Radio aposs Today programme the Tories were trying to distract from the real issues. The only person who wants to focus on Winston Churchill’s statue is the Conservative Party, and frankly it’s bizarre, he said. They want a culture war because they want to distract from the central issue. Implement the reviews! Do something! Change it! You’re in power, you’ve been in power for a decade! The clash comes after weeks of Black Lives Matter protests against the death of George Floyd, who was killed at the hands of US police. Boris Johnson has declared black lives matter and last night announced a Commission to look at racial inequality in the UK.  But Mr Lammy branded it a back of a fag packet scheme after Mr Johnson failed to announce its timetable, staffing or remit.He said the PM must announce changes now - and start by implementing dozens of recommendations from past reviews that arenapost yet in place.A row also erupted because Mr Johnson said he wants to change the narrative so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination. Critics hit back at the PM for mentioning a sense of racism as well as the racism itself.  Amid the row, Mr Lammy was asked by BBC interviewer Justin Webbthere was such a thing as white privilege. He replied: Look, there will be people listening who are working class, who are poor, they may be in northern constituencies - they’re not feeling particularly privileged, they’re having a tough time in a Britain that suffered from austerity. But when people talk about white privilege they’re not saying your le isn’t hard or tough or a challenge because of the class issues that remain in Britain - what they’re saying is race is not one of the things that makes it harder. And I think in a sense - I feel like I’m being gaslightedwe ask questions like ‘does white privilege or does racism exist’.  Frankly, given all the art that has been made, all the writing that has been delivered, whether in reviews or black writing, all the comedy that has been made that’s made people laugh - of course those things still exist in our society. The time now is frankly for majority culture to do something about it. Mr Lammy went on to say it is deeply worrying and frankly immature that Britain is still having a conversation about whether racism actually exists.

It follows claims - denied by Number  - that chief nurse Ruth May had been dropped from a briefing by Downing Street after she refused to back Dominic Cummings.Jonathan Van Tam, the deputy chief medical officer caused embarrassment to the government at a press conference on May  when, in response to a question on Mr Cummings’ alleged lockdown breaches, he said: “In my opinion the rules are clear and they have always been clear. “In my opinion they are for the benefit of all. In my opinion they apply to all.” Two days earlier, Boris Johnson had prevented England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty, and the chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, from answering questions on the subject at that day’s press conference. Asked today why scientists did not appear every day when it was clear there were questions only they could answer, Mr Raab quipped: “You havenapost tried me on a question that I canapost answer yet, but Iaposm happy to be proved wrong. And he suggested the dramatic reduction in experts appearing on the  was due to their workload. He said: “Theyaposll continue to attend these press conferences, perhaps not on a daily basis, theyaposve got a huge amount of other work to do.

The number of medics and scientists appearing at the daily televised briefing has halved since the start of June. On some days they are replaced by industry experts.

The -year-old  Manchester United  and England striker urged the authorities to make a U-turn and allow vulnerable children who have been getting free meals during the  coronavirus  lockdown to continue receiving them in the summer holidays. But today the Prime Ministeraposs spokesman confirmed that the scheme would be ending with the school term. He promised to write to the footballer soon after the launch of the maketheuturn campaign urging the government to change their mind. He said: “ The PM understands the issues facing families across the UK which is why last week the government announced an additional £m for local authorities to benefit families who are struggling to afford food and other basic essentials.”  Boris Johnson has said he expects schools to make food parcels available for collection or delivery and schools can continue to offer vouchers to eligible pupils. But the government will not be funding the provision in the same way and Labour has warned that the funding is not nearly enough to cover the estimated £m cost of providing free school meals. The spokesman said the Prime Minister will respond to Marcus Rashford’s letter as soon as he can. He added: “He’s been using his profile in a positive way to highlight some very important issues.  Rashford, who has raised £million to boost food distribution with the charity FareShare, has admitted to using food banks and receiving free meals as a child. Itaposs written from the heart and itaposs about how my le was at the moment - the letter is to open up and let people understand the impact on families and to know Iaposve done the right thing, he told BBC Breakfast. Rashford is one of five children in his immediate family and has been working hard to help those in a similar situation to the one he grew up in as a youngster. What families are going through now, Iaposve once had to go through that - and itaposs very dficult to find a way out. Itaposs very important for me to help people who are struggling. Whether the outcome changes or doesnapost change - thataposs why I wrote it. In the past I have done a lot of work to do with children. When I heard about the schools shutting down that obviously means free meals for some kids that they are not getting at schools. I remember when I was in school I was on free meals and my mum wouldnapost get home until  oaposclock, so my next meal would have been about  oaposclock. I was fortunate, there are kids in much more dficult situations that donapost get that meal at home. When I heard the schools were closing I wanted to make a positive influence and make sure the kids are getting the meals they need. Marcus Rashford has explained how Man Utd helped his mother out by allowing him onto their youth programme a year early. The striker joined up with the United academy at -years-old, despite the programme being for players aged  and above. Rashford was one of five children in his immediate family, and he opened up on the tough circumstances that pushed his mother, Melanie, to request he be taken on before his th birthday. Speaking to the BBC, Rashford said: My mum was a single parent, she had five kids all living in the same house. The programme that I started at  years old, youaposre supposed to start it at  years old.

Here, she explains how...A couple of weeks after lockdown started, I found myself on the other side of London in a housing estate I didn’t know, trying to find a young woman I had never met before. She was a refugee, pregnant, alone and living in temporary accommodation. It was pouring with rain and I was standing in a stairwell as, in broken English, she was trying to explain over the phone how I could find her. When I finally got to her doorstep, I couldn’t even smile at her because I was wearing a face mask. And social distancing rules meant I couldn’t go in to sit down, have a cup of tea and explain the things in the box I was bringing her, as I would do normally. But as she stood in her doorway, I could tell she was really excited.  Hours later, we received a text message. It said how happy and delighted she was with the things we had brought her – that now she finally felt ready to have her baby, which she hadn’t before. It was such a moving moment.We normally have a core group of  volunteers, but since coronavirus it has just been me and my daughter Rosa, , running everything. So we decided to concentrate on baby boxes for newborns. They contain a sling, a steriliser and a breast pump as well as baby clothes, nappies, wet wipes, nappy cream and hygiene stuff for the mother. We’ve even started putting in a couple of loo rolls. It has been a struggle, but we have been helped enormously by National Lottery funding. And because lockdown has made it dficult to accept donations, where necessary we have also been able to afford a few bits to put in the boxes. The grant from The National Lottery has been a leline for us, allowing us to keep giving out our boxes which, in turn, the mothers say are their leline. Meanwhile, in Kent, another National Lottery-funded project, Youth Sports Trust, is tackling a problem facing young people - fitness and staying connected with friends... Sport is keeping kids connected  Teacher Guy Wilkins works closely with children’s charity Youth Sport Trust to enable children and young people to access competitive sport, training opportunities and learning leadership skills - and lockdown hasnapost put a stop to that. The -year-old, from Kentaposs Marjorie McClure School, said: During lockdown we’ve been running online meetings, setting physical challenges and sharing ideas for PE at home - such as ‘washing line tennis’ - to bring people even closer together. Many of us also got involved with the charity . challenge. For example, one of our students, James,  – who is a massive Crystal Palace fan – did  keepy-uppies.” Jamesaposs mum Wendy said the charity has been a vital link to the outside world for her son - and he has loved embracing the challenges. She told us: James has really benefited from having regular Zoom calls from school with his form tutor and Guy, as well as Tom who runs the after school cricket club which James attends.  James loves to have a look at these ideas and try out as many as he can. They suggested that the pupils try the daily Joe Wicks sessions as a fitness challenge and heaposs ended up doing them most days. The school challenged the pupils to take part in the . challenge so James ran walked .km and made a donation to the Bromley Mencap charity. Guy’s school – which is one of a network of six YST inclusive schools across South London – receives up to £, of National Lottery funding each year. This money helps to pay for leadership opportunities, give young people training to increase self esteem, confidence and communication skills, and the opportunity to experience badminton, volleyball, wheelchair basketball and athletics at inclusive sports festivals.They will also be taking part in YST’s National School Sport Week at Home, taking place from  to  June.

She explained: “The first year of opening for the Science Museumaposs new aposMedicine: The Wellcome Galleriesapos hasn’t at all been what I envisaged. “We were only open for five months before we had to close, and it was especially sad because we’d been lucky enough to have glowing press and visitor feedback.“Since lockdown we’ve been focusing on really pushing our digital delivery - which you can explore here . We are working on our oral history programme and - as part of a larger digitisation project, we’re photographing more than , objects from our collections – from space suits to Tracy the transgenic sheep. There’s also a very extensive  blog  and  learning resources and going online makes everything accessible to a much wider audience. “Some of our most searched items have been pieces including historic hospital ventilators.” The newly-opened Medicine Galleries - which were part funded by an £million grant from The National Lottery Heritage Fund - have proved a huge hit since moving online.

Northern Ireland is adopting a similar relaxation of the regulations for people living alone. Adults living alone or single parents living with children under the age of  can form a bubble with one other household which means they will effectively be treated as a single household for the purpose of the lockdown rules. That means they can visit each other indoors in their homes - staying overnightthey wish - and they will not have to observe the two-metre social-distancing rule. These bubbles are strictly exclusive - neither household can form a bubble with anyone . It means elderly people living alone could form a bubble with the household of an adult son or daughter enabling them to visit and even hug their grandchildren for the first time since lockdown. Single parents could pair up with their own parents allowing them to share childcare duties and reuniting grandparents and grandchildren. And couples who do not live together will be able to visit and to stay with each other.  But some scientists have advised against social bubbles. A SAGE report of its meeting on May  said: Sage advised that social bubbles have the potential to create signicant unwanted effects and advised against their introduction in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures. Sage advised strong caution concerning the introduction of social bubbling - particularly in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures.

A high-level meeting is due to take place between their Portuguese lawyer and detectives involved in the long-running probe. Pressure is mounting on authorities to come clean over what they know about tragic Madeleine’s fate. German prosecutors claim to have evidence she is dead but have so far refused to tell the McCanns what that is. However they have shared the information with Portuguese police, who last night described it as “signicant” and “very important”. Kate and Gerry’s lawyer Rogerio Alves is set to meet with detectives in a matter of days to be given an update on the investigation. He is hoping they will finally reveal what evidence the Germans have against suspect Christian Brueckner. Mr Alves said he will be meeting the Policia Judiciaria this week to find outthey are going to start actively investigating the case again. “I will try to find out what information they have that can support the reopening of the file here,” he said.  “I want to find outthere are new leads for them to chase. I want to know what is being done. “I intend to get answers on these matters this week. “What I hope is that everybody helps to find the truth instead of hiding information, or keeping information for themselves. “We are waiting for more information from the police and from the prosecutor.  “We are waiting for that information that should be provided to us, but there is nothing more we can do but wait. “According to Portuguese law,the prosecutor has new information about the crime he should reopen it. “I don’t know how strong the new evidence is so I don’t know what the prosecutor is going to do. “In terms of the investigation, and the parent’s hopes for justice, last week was a lost week.  “At the moment the police forces are arguing and this row is stupid. It seems they are trying to compete with each other. “Madeleine’s parents don’t want to know which police force thinks it is doing the best. They do not want a war of words. “It is no use – this is a waste of time. “All the police should be doing is trying to solve the case. I want to see full cooperation between the police forces.”  Last week Mr Alves branded German authorities “cruel” for refusing to say what evidence they have that Madeleine was killed. He said Kate and Gerry, of Rothley, Leics, “have a right to know” what happened to their daughter. “They need to know what’s going on,” he said. “It’s a question of legality but also humanity. It’s cruel.” It was claimed yesterday that Brueckner may be flown to Portugal to take part in a reconstruction of the night Madeleine disappeared.  It could prove key to unlocking the case and would be simple to organise once a formal German request is approved by Lisbon. Portuguese legal expert Rui Pereira told Correio da Manha newspaper that any reconstruction depends on countries working together.

So she was horried when she found her beloved pooch vomiting blood and rushed him to the vet for tests. Four-year-old Bailey was diagnosed with pancreatitis, a painful inflammation of the organ that can be caused by obesity, and was put on anti-inflammatory medication for two weeks and a diet overhaul was recommended. Alicia, from Watton, Norfolk, said: When youaposre a dog owner you think youaposre doing the very best for your dog. So we really took it to heart when we found out we had contributed to his illness. We felt like weaposd let ourselves down - heaposs our everything. Alicia, , and her boyfriend, Liam Applegarth, , who is in the armed forces, admitted they didnapost know too much about dog nutrition so just bought a bag of food from the supermarket which claimed to be perfect for an all round diet But after his health scare, theyaposve swapped him to a raw food diet and the dference is incredible. She said: I just couldnapost believe how quickly he took to it. It grossed me out at first, the idea of using raw meat, but when you think about it dogs werenapost made to eat kibble.  In the wild theyaposd be eating food theyaposd caught. Between starting his new diet August  and the summer of , Bailey shed half his body weight, slimming down from kg to kg - drawing admiring comments from fellow dog walkers who had known him since he was a puppy. Friends, family and fellow dog walkers were lost for words,said Alicia, who is also delighted to report that he has never suffered with pancreatitis again. The vet was absolutely shocked. He couldnapost believe it, I donapost think he could believe that such dference was made by swapping to raw food  - and heaposs a vet!  And when I started looking at old photos, I realised why everyone was making such a fuss - he really was a super slimming pooch. Alicia and Liam had wanted a dog since they first moved in together, in June , but it had been impossible as they were living in rented accommodation. So, after buying their own place in , getting a puppy had been their priority and they had settled on a Cocker Spaniel, as they thought the breed would suit their personalities and lestyle. Alicia said:  We wanted an active, lively dog to fit in with our lestyle, as weaposre a young couple and quite active - so a Cocker Spaniel ticked all the boxes.  Theyaposre known for their kooky personalities, after all. Falling head over heels for Bailey, who they bought from a local breeder, he made their little family feel complete. Alicia said: He was everything we could have hoped for in a first pet. He was your perfect puppy, so friendly and engaging. He was so happy to see anybody. Wanting to be responsible, they had decided to have him neutered - heeding the warnings that his metabolism might slow, causing him to gain a few kilos, by exercising portion control. Alicia said: We gave him strict portions of a generic, supermarket-bought kibble, as well as daily short walks and a three-hour walk once a week.  So the couple were flummoxed by what was causing his considerable weight gain  - only realising once Alicia started researching alternative diets on the web that it was probably the kind of food they had been giving him. Looking back, we know now it was the kibble that was the weight gain culprit, but we didnapost know anything about nutrition for dogs back then. We just chose the most colourful brand, which made the best claims about dog health. He went from being an energetic, fun-loving dog to a lethargic and lazy hound. Recalling the upsetting day they realised how poorly Bailey was, she said: I woke up one morning and could hear Bailey retching at the bottom of the bed.  Liam was away with the forces at the time. I got up to let Bailey out and he ran into the garden and would not stop throwing up. At first I thought it was just an upset stomach. He didnapost eat anything that day, and the next he was vomiting up blood - it was terrying.  They rushed him to the vet where he was put on a drip for  hours and given a full health screening - including an ultrasound and blood tests. She started researching alternative diets and came across Natures Menu - and hasnapost looked back. She said: He looks like a completely dferent dog.

The Met Office says the UKaposs long-range forecast shows a repeat of the aposwall-to-wallapos sunshine seen at the end of May is unlikely. Millions in the UK are relying on fine weather to carry out rule-abiding social lives with friends and family parks and gardens during the ongoing coronavirus lockdown. Thunder and rain due to sweep through parts of the UK between tomorrow and Thursday puts a dampener on those plans as Juneaposs wash-out continues. Met Office spokesman Oli Clayden said the long-range weather forecast would so far dash hopes of an early summer scorcher. While the weather is looking set to improve once summer officially begins, there is no heatwave forecast in the next four weeks. Click here for the latest coronavirus news and updates   He told the : It doesnapost look like at the moment like thereaposs going to be the wall-to-wall sunshine and blue skies that we saw a few weeks back. But Mr Clayden said the forecast was monitored day by day, and could very likely change. The Met Office long range report predicts changeable weather through much of June, easing by early July. Many areas are likely to see a mixture of bright or sunny spells and showers, some of which may turn heavy in places, it continues.  It also forecasts temperatures around average or above what is expected for this time of year for the foreseeable future. The forecast for late June across the south of the UK warns of a risk of some spells of rain becoming heavy and possibly thundery. The east may remain cooler and cloudier during the same period. The weather is predicted to remain unsettled for the rest of June, then is forecast to settle in early July with prolonged drier and sunnier spells for much of the UK. However a chance of showers will remain, with temperatures predicted toto average.  The scorcher that bathed Brits in sunshine throughout late May was a relief for many in lockdown. But it also sparked concerns some were flouting social distancing guidelines, as the heatwave coincided with loosening rules and the late Bank Holiday weekend. Scenes of massive crowds and clf-jumpersapos tombstoningapos injuries at Durdle Door in Dorset drew particular outrage during the heatwave period. The death toll has soared past , and the UK has seen localised outbreaks in recent weeks, as the Covid- aposRapos transmission rates rose in areas including Englandaposs southwest. Scenes from packed beaches and parks led to fears people were increasingly ignoring the rules to gather outdoors in the sunshine.  The government has came under criticism for allowing people in England to drive wherever they wanted. People from dferent households in England can presently meet in groups of six in parks and gardens as long as they remain two-metres apart. The restrictions were eased as scientists say the risk of the virus being passed on is lower outdoors. The government has continued to encourage people who are not self-isolating to be outdoors and to exercise, citing mental health benefits.

Rayshard Brooks died in hospital on Friday night after a scuffle with officers outside a Wendyaposs in Georgia, having allegedly failed a sobriety test and resisting arrest after falling asleep in his car. The -year-old was a father to three girls and also had a stepson, WSB-TV reports. Investigators tonight released footage of the struggle with Atlanta Police that preceded him being shot and killed, which comes only weeks after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. It has sparked fresh demonstrations in the streets of Atlanta, which saw the Wendyaposs where Mr Brooks died lit on fire by protesters on Saturday night.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email  Images on local television showed the restaurant in flames while an anti-racist march has also completely shut down the Interstate  Highway. Mr Floydaposs death has sparked three weeks of widespread protests against racial discrimination, and in some cases violent clashes with police and right-wing counter-protesters, across the US and around the world.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has now launched a probe into Mr Brooksapos death. In a statement given to CNN, it says police were called to the restaurant at around .pm on Friday after a man was found to be asleep in his vehicle, blocking the drive-through lane and forcing other customers to drive around him. The GBI says police then gave Mr Brooks a sobriety test, which he failed, leading to the scuffle.  Attorneys L. Chris Stewart and Justin Miller, who are now representing Mr Brooksapos family, released the images on Saturday night. According to broadcaster CBS, he had spent the evening of his death celebrating his eldest daughteraposs birthday. The fatal shooting led to Atlantaaposs police chief, Erika Shields, resigning on Saturday. Shieldsapos statement said: For more than two decades, I have served alongside some of the finest women and men in the Atlanta Police Department. Out of a deep and abiding love for this City and this department, I offered to step aside as police chief. APD has my full support, and Mayor Bottoms has my support on the future direction of this department. I have faith in the Mayor, and it is time for the city to move forward and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The Atlanta police involved in the shooting have been criticised for the use of firearms, given that Mr Brooks appears to have only had a Taser. The cityaposs mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said: I do not believe that this was a justied use of deadly force and have called for the immediate termination of the officer. US politician Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia political candidate, is among those who have called for restrictions on police use of deadly force.Commenting on Twitter, she said: A Taser is not a deadly weapon. A gun is. Adrenaline and irritation are not the same as mortal fear. Running away should not be punishable by death. Public safety must mean the public is safe. All of us. And Jen Jordan, a Democratic State Senator for Georgiaaposs th District, wrote: Asleep in his car. Thataposs why police were called. Now he is dead after being shot three times in the back as he was running away. #RayshardBrooksshould not be dead. Authorities have not yet released the names of the two officers, who were both white. A video taken from a nearby car, and released by the GBI, shows Mr Brooks on the ground outside his car, struggling with two officers.

Prince Harry was introduced to the South African chain a few years back by his personal protection officer and has been spotted at the chain several times, including a midnight visit to the restaurant in Fulham Broadway, south west London in .Harry, who was  at the time, forked out £. on his takeaway dinner for himself and a friend at .pm on a Tuesday night. Two members of the Prince’s personal security sat patiently behind him while he waited more than  minutes for his Portuguese inspired grub to be prepared. Harry was seen fidgeting with his mobile phone and making animated hand gestures to his mate as the pair killed time to distract themselves from hunger. A stunned onlooker said: “It was surreal. He was very charming and politely refused a member of staff who approached him for a picture. I was gobsmacked to see him.” Another witness added: “Moments after he left the restaurant clutching his dinner in a paper bag a member of staff jumped on the bench the Harry was sitting on and shouted: “I’m on the Prince’s throne!’ Nobody could believe what happened.”  However not everyone will be particularly impressed by what the royal ordered from the Nandoaposs menu. He ordered a pitta with extra cheese and a side of creamy mash, along with a double chicken wrap with chips. He also got a soft drink and bottle of water. However the pitta was lemon and herb, the chainaposs mildest offering which many people see as a terrible order. It’s unclear whether Harry – who wore a green polo shirt, denim jeans and a baseball cap partially disguising his face according to a witness - paid full price for the grub or took advantage of the  per cent discount the chicken-chain offers to military personnel.After picking up their order Harry, who was dating Cressida Bonas  at the time, and his pal casually exited through the car park which is connected with the building."},{"url":null,"title":"freak lightning bolt leaves nine","story":"NewsFreak lightning bolt leaves nine cows dead in field after torrential stormUp to nine milking cows are thought to have been killed after being struck by lightning in Dunlicky, County Clare, on the west coast of Ireland, during a heavy stormShareCommentsByAnna MacSwan:,  JUN NewsMultiple lightning strikes were reported in the early afternoon\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

One passer-by reported seeing the animals as they drove along the scenic Dunlicky Road towards Kilkee. There was a lot of thunderstorm activity in the area at the time and the sky blackened all of a sudden. The rain was pouring down really heavy for about  minutes, they told the Irish Examiner. The torrential storms also forced a number of people who had been fishing nearby to run for cover in their cars.One local said: Just after we passed Dunlicky Castle we saw the cows in the field. There were a few cars and men in there as well. I think it was nine milking cows we counted. It is not the first time that cows have been struck by lightning in recent years in Ireland.

Archangel Michaelaposs Orthodox chapel, located deep in the mountains of Siberia, is the countryaposs highest-altitude church at a height of ,ft. The church, close to the Akken Glavier, was razed to the ground after what was at first believed an accident with candles. Video footage shows flames burning on ,ft-tall Belukha, the highest peak in the Altai Mountains.

The timber church was originally built in , with funds raised by relatives of climbers lost in the mountains. V Gornom, a Russian outlet, reports that police have now identied self-confessed satanist Sergey Tuzovsky, , as their main suspect. It comes after several witnesses claim the bearded “shaman” was seen on the lower slopes of Belukha.One said: We have turned to the police with a statement about intentional arson. The check has started.” Climber Anatoly Minichkin, , from Moscow, who was one of the last to visit the chapel on Friday, says no candles were alight at the time.

We knew we needed to improve his fitness.“Once we got him fit – we needed to get him up to scratch and keep him playing at the same time – and got into his head in terms of how we played, he was great for us.“He was brilliant at taking the ball, getting us up the park and running past defenders, his pace was a major asset.“I didn’t have a lot of hair at the time but I still lost a bit because he would drive you bananas at times with some of the silly things he’d do in good positions.“It goes without saying that he’s matured well beyond that now. He might have lost a bit of pace in recent years but he is a seasoned campaigner.“Back then he was desperate to come up to Scotland and play games.“The big thing we sold him on was the area, the lestyle – the tranquillity up here compared to the hurly-burly down south.“We told him he could get himself on the TV, sell himself in the big games and we were the type of club thatsomeone came in for you with a decent offer, you’d have the option to go.”Hayes – who started out at Reading – eventually left for Aberdeen in  after three years with Inverness.Over  games in five seasons and a League Cup winners’ medal in the Granite City followed before he clinched a £ million move to Celtic.The winger struggled to establish himself as a Hoops regular but he started several crucial games for the Scottish champions, including the  Scottish Cup final triumph over Hearts and the stunning Europa League victory over Lazio in Rome last November.Two months earlier he grabbed the second goal in the Old Firm derby as Neil Lennon’s side beat Rangers - at Ibrox.Hayes’ Parkhead exit – which has also led to interest from his former employers at Pittodrie – came less than two weeks after he picked up his third title medal in three campaigns with the club.Malpas said: “I thought Jonny would’ve got another contract at Celtic and that he would happily have stayed.“But maybe they’re trimming their squad a bit to get players in and maybe there wasn’t going to be the chance to play as many games next season.“He certainly didn’t let Celtic down when he was called upon.“For United, though, good on them for trying to sign Jonny. They’re clearly thinking about the right players and I think that’s the type of player they need.“He’s experienced and he’s played at a very good level. He’s still got pace, he can play in more than one position and he’s good in a dressing room.“I thinkyou were struggling in the middle of the pitch he could do a job there as well.“You’d never say he was the best defender, but he never seems to get a doing from the wide players he plays against.“Sometimes you think he isn’t the best at beating people yet he always seems to get crosses in.“For us at Inverness he was great at getting the ball in the box and created a lot of goals for guys like Adam Rooney.”The former United captain saw a transformation in Hayes during his time with the Dons.He added: “I’ve followed Jonny’s career for years and hoped he would do well.“He was great for us and did everything we asked. He’s one of the many guys you like to think you’ve helped a bit.“Jonny’s really matured and looked after his fitness. At Aberdeen he was playing under a bit more pressure in front of a more demanding crowd and that helped him make the move to Celtic.“He was a cheeky chappie when we had him –he got a bit of stick, he’d give a bit back. Some things used to affect him but I could see a dference at Aberdeen, he’d outgrown that and he could handle that.“We had a great group at Inverness. When we went in, we only kept three or four players and started again.“Graeme Shinnie was one of the kids that was there and he has developed into a right good player as well.“These guys would run through a wall for you and they were a joy to work with.“We didn’t have great facilities but these guys wanted to learn, they wanted to work and they had a great attitude.”Dundee United appoint senior club representative to liaise with Terrors fan groups\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-fan-groups-liaison embed # secretNdKFhlJe\" data-secret\"NdKFhlJe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

This is achieved by installing a large cylindrical passageway in the centre of a cage, from which tarpaulin hangs and protects salmon from lice infestations when they swim to the surface to fill their swim-bladders.At Port na Cro, the tarpaulin hangs to a m depth and the feeders are placed at m.Gareth Siney, farm manager at Port na Cro, said: #At the moment, we use lots of dferent tools to tackle sea lice such as water pressure and using cleaner fish that naturally pick the sea lice off our salmon.

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly. The covering can be washed with other laundry, using your normal detergent.When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.How do I stop my glasses from steaming up If you wear glasses, wearing a face mask at the same time can cause the lenses to steam up, making it dficult to see properly.But the common problem has an easy solution, thanks to advice from doctors in the medical journal Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.To prevent the issue, doctors advise washing your glasses with soapy water before putting the mask on, and rinsing them under warm water.Then, gently dry off the lenses with a clean towel or cloth before putting them back on.Washing the lenses with soapy water leaves behind a ldquothin surfactant film that reduces misting on the lenses, meaning they now shouldnrsquot steam up when a face mask is worn.Should face coverings be worn where The current government advice states that face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, which includes some shops and public transport.At the moment, people are not being told to wear them outdoors, while exercising, or in schools or offices.Several airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, have introduced a requirement for passengers to wear face masks on board.However, the government believes that face masks should be reserved for people who need them to protect against risks

has been played at the East Lothian course.Last yearrsquos event was won by Bernd Wiesberger after a play-off with Benjamin Hebert.Among those hoping to line up at the tournament is North Berwicks

kayak, is part of the proposals revealed by the local authority with a series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek consultation on its online hub on Monday.The Scottish Government is revising its National Development Planning Framework which gives an overview of what it wants to see develop on key sites across Scotland.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are grateful for the many views and ideas received in response to early engagement on National Planning Framework  .Our analysis of the responses is underway and will continue over the summer, and we expect to publish an update in the autumn.The council consultation can be found at

Yoursquod scarcely know that there has been any lting of lockdown. One neighbour says her grandmother scoffs at the idea that the coronavirus crisis is like the last war, when she was a child in a nearby town. Although they were often hungry, they had complete freedom. Even when the air raid siren went, and they had to e into shelters, they did not feel the all-pervasive threat of today.Nor, unless they were extremely remote or unlucky, were people shut off from each other. We talk a lot about the power of modern technology to keep us connected, but in those times, whether you were in a village or a city, there was daily contact with other folk, evenyou lived alone. People wouldnrsquot have felt the need for video calls when they could nip out of theirdoor and visit whoever they liked nearby. The Blitz spirit is not entirely a myth, but the circumstances in which it thrived were very dferent from this pandemic.My mother lived in London and, in , like countless city children, was evacuated to the country. She was luckier than many, being sent not to strangers but to an aunt, who lived in Herefordshire, near the Welsh border. There was no running water, light was by paraffin lamp, her uncle was an irascible war veteran, and her aunt would often retreat to bed for days, finding the extra responsibility rather too much. But for an -year-old, collecting eggs from under hens, sauntering up the lane for still-warm jugs of milk from the farm, and seeing a night-time sky lit by stars was a revelation. From then on, she counted the days until she could leave London forever.Not all evacuees felt the same way. Encountering beetles and bugs for the first time was hard enough, but herds of cows with a bull among them must have been pretty alarming. One boy, who had never previously left the Gallowgate, ran to tell the farmer that ldquothey coos are eating arsquo your grass. Another Glaswegian, taken into a Perthshire home, escaped onto the roof when they ran him a bath. He thought they were trying to drown him.Recalling that period, my mother spoke of country folksrsquo shock at the poverty of inner city children, who had come from slums. Those who organised the mass evacuation were appalled to discover that, when asked to provide each child with a change of clothing, a toothbrush and enough food for a dayrsquos journey, a lot of families were unable to do so. It was a sobering eye-opener. Rural hardship was re, but it did not compare to the scale of urban deprivation: barefoot youngsters with rickets, scurvy, ringworm, or so underfed they were the colour of lard.Itrsquos hard to imagine what it must have felt like to be dropped into a world of fields and trees and pitch black nights, when you were used to well-lit canyons of concrete and stone or to find yourself alone in a bed, when usually therersquod be siblings on all sides, keeping you warm, and your parents only a step away. Some children were so miserable, they had to be sent home. For others, like my mother, it sparked a lelong love of the countryside.Not that she idealised her auntrsquos way of le. Some aspects of it were, for a Londoner, like stepping back in time. Nor, in the s, was there any glamorising of country le. It was often equated with backward attitudes and ignorance. If anything, most villagers dreamed of escaping to the city, or at least the suburbs, and a clean, warm house with all mod-cons.Irsquove been reading Dirk Bogardersquos memoir, Great Meadow, in which he recalls his childhood in the Sussex Downs, from the age of six. Between  and , he spent weekends and long spells of holiday in what his affluent parents called a cottage, but photos show as a substantial house. Later he was packed off to Glasgow, which he loathed, but thatrsquos another story. In Great Meadow, he and his little sister were looked after by a nanny, while his actress mother swanned around in a kimono, and his father raced up and down to London where he was on The Timesrsquos picture desk. Bogarde often mentions the healthiness of the country, compared to London, where public transport was frowned on, because of the risk of germs. This was a legacy, perhaps, of the Spanish flu.Bogarde loved everything about the cottage, but the most noteworthy feature was the outside lavatory. Every Friday he had to dig a hole in the garden and, under cover of dusk, empty the privy bucket into it. His great fear was of tripping, because sanitation was basic. Theyrsquod have a weekly bath, filled by their nanny, but his parents preferred going to the nearest pub for their ablutions.Years ago I visited friends in rural Perthshire who had an outside toilet. I rather liked it: it was made of wood, and smelled of sawdust. Unlike the shed at the bottom of many cottage gardens, one wall was open, so the view was lovely, even in the snow. You didnrsquot have to crunch over snails in the dark to reach it ndash bedrooms came with chamberpots ndash and as a guest there was no fear of ever being asked to empty it. To watch him on screen, yoursquod never think Bogarde was the man to cope with such a noisome task.

The two-metre rule is causing massive problems as the economy tanks, yet the medical evidence for its effectiveness is contradictory.But the most serious accusation made last week against Boris Johnson was that he was asleep at the wheel in early March, and that his dilatory behaviour led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.The claim was made by the former SAGE member, Professor Neil Ferguson .ldquoHad we introduced lockdown a week earlier, the Imperial College epidemiologist told MPs last week, ldquowersquod have reduced the final death toll by at least half.In other words,the UK Government had closed the schools and shops on March  instead of March , the official death toll might have been , instead of ,.

We didnrsquot close the borders, didnrsquot protect care homes, abandoned testing and locked down too late. The question is: who is to blame for all this The editor of The Lancet, Richard Horton, in ldquoThe Covid Catastrophe which is to be published this week, names the guilty man: Boris Johnson. He failed to attend crucial meetings of COBRA, the Cabinet crisis committee, failed to listen to scientists, and thought the country should ldquotake it on the chin in order to protect the economy.But it was not just the PM who delayed lockdown by one week. This was also the policy of the Scottish Government.I happened to be in the Scottish parliament on March , the day that Leo Varadkar announced the closure of schools and universities in Ireland. At First Ministerrsquos Questions, Nicola Sturgeon explained why she was not following suit. She was, she insisted, ldquofollowing the science.School children sent home were likely to take the disease into their communities and to older people, ldquowhich might be a greater risk in terms of spread of infection than their being in school. She also said that parents would have to stay at home to look after them and this would denude staff for essential services like the NHS.:London Protests: More than  arrested as Boris Johnson condemns far-right protests as lsquoracist thuggeryrsquoIt all seemed sensible at the time. The national clinical director, Jason Leitch, was all over the media saying that the vast majority of us were going to get the virus anyway, because there was no vaccine, and that we had to ldquoprotect the vulnerable as it ldquoworked its way through the population.The release of SAGE minutes two weeks ago confirms that the scientic advisers were at best cool about lockdown. They may not have been in thrall to heartless herd immunity, but they did believe that trying to suppress the virus would be counterproductive.On March , the minutes say \"SAGE was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress the spread of Covid- will cause a second peak.It added that it was ldquoa near certainty that countries such as China, where heavy suppression is under way, will experience a second peak once measures are relaxed.The scientic consensus was that eradication of the disease was not possible because it would spread until herd immunity ndash % of the population ndash finally burned the virus out. But Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, took a dferent view. She closed the borders immediately cases appeared and kept them closed, and imposed a severe lockdown internally and suppressed the virus until it disappeared.

However, the minutes seem to confirm that, as Professor Lawrence Freedman argued in the New Statesman, ldquothe Government was largely following SAGErsquos advice.Some have claimed that Nicola Sturgeon wanted to follow dferent advice and was overruled by Westminster. That isnrsquot the case. The First Minister was following the same scientic advice as Westminster, and made clear she did not believe lockdown was yet necessary or desirable on March .Itrsquos hard to believe that a weekrsquos delay could have led to , deaths, as many as on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Scientists will debate this for years.Indeed, analysts in Bristol, led by the mathematical modeller Professor Simon Wood, now claim now that the disease peaked before lockdown was introduced, suggesting that SAGE was right.SAGE had always argued, as the minutes show, that the best way to contain the spread was hand washing, social distancing, and protecting the old and vulnerable. The UK Government was only persuaded of lockdown by Neil Fergusonrsquos infamous forecast, on March , that without it , would die.The one thing we have learned from coronavirus is that science is not a monolith and that scientists disagree as much as politicians.

Big name retailers moved in and, as time wore on, the ldquoto let signs began to appear.Now, however, that same community spirit that raised pound.s d from local people to pay for their th century fountain is helping to revive Dumfries High Street, in a project that, it is hoped, will provide inspiration forother towns up and down the country.Rather than wait for someone  to step in to breathe new le into the empty shops and buildings, local people are pushing ahead with plans to take back control of their neglected high street.Work is expected to start within weeks on the first High Street building to be reclaimed from lying empty.While its Victorian frontage with all its unique character will remain in place, a pound. million redevelopment will see the former Bakerrsquos Oven shop reborn as seven new affordable rent flats, with space for start-up businesses, art exhibitions and socialand community enterprise projects.Named ldquoThe Oven, it is one of eight retail units included in community-run Midsteeple Quarterrsquos innovative plans to rejuvenate the heart of the town as a place to live, visit, shop, dine and be entertained.The innovative project is being eyed up by towns and organisations across theUK, anxious to seeits community buy-out model might be a viable option to help transform other places hit by a sht towards internet shopping and out of town retail parks.ldquoFor a long time the town centre was bookies, charity shops and empty units. Dumfries has just said lsquoenough is enoughrsquo, says Evie Copland, chairwoman of the community benefit society, Dumfries High Street Ltd, which is behind the Midsteeple Quarter project.ldquoPeople had been buying buildings in the High Street for too long and not givingus something we could be proud of.ldquoAs people began to use their collective voices, we have been able to get a special development off the ground.ldquoThe Oven is the flagship, and a blueprint to showwhat the people of Dumfries can do.The plans have been brewing since  when the townrsquos artist-led development trust, The Stove Network, carried out research to find out what the future of High Street might be and to ask local people what they wanted.ldquoThere were a number of issues, says Scott Mackay, manager of The Midsteeple Quarter.ldquoOne was ownership of High Street buildings. We discovereda lot are owned by absentee landlords who lived where, people notwith a vested interest in the town.ldquoFunds and investment companies had been buying up the buildings and renting out ground floors to national retail chains. Sometimes these buildings have two more floors, but they just lie empty.ldquoIt is the same at high streets up and down the country ndash every one had the same shops and streets had lost their local character.ldquoAs high streets contracted, there was out of town retail and internet shopping, so a lot of shop units were lying empty and the values of buildings dropped.With buildings which once carried a poundm price tag now valued at around half that, and vacant units with sky-high rents but no sign of new occupants, hopes grew that the townspeople could use community buy-out legislation to help them take over empty properties.Inspired by rural land community buy-outs in places such as Eigg, Assynt and Gigha, and driven by the townrsquos creative and artistic community, the Dumfries plan was designed to be Scotlandrsquos first ldquourban buy-out.Within weeks of its launch and a mock high street protest aimed at highlighting empty shops, the community benefit company had attracted hundreds ofpound shareholders eager tohave their say in forging a new-look town centre.Their plans were boosted two years ago, when Dumfries  Galloway Council agreed to hand over the former Bakersrsquo Oven building in an asset transfer deal that cost the group just pound.Itrsquos meant the group has not yet had to draw on community ownership legislation, while funds for The Ovenrsquos redevelopment have come from a iety of sources including the Regeneration Capital Grant Fund which is delivered in partnership between the Scottish Government and COSLA, and South Scotland Enterprise Fund.Planning approval forThe Oven is expected next month. Demolition work to the rear will begin later this year, with hopes it will be finished within  months.The organisation is also in the process of raising funds to buy two other units and has approached the owners of two others.Mr Mackay said the intention is to create a vibrant blend of retail, affordable housing, exhibition and arts space, with entertainment and food and drink outlets helping to transform the area into a bustling hub.ldquoAn obstacle for high streets for a long time has been a lsquoretail onlyrsquo or lsquoretail firstrsquo planning requirement, he added. ldquoIt meant that by pm everything in the High Street would be dead.

He replied on March : ldquoI strongly believe the British Government is correct to follow what our own advisors tell us. I was so troubled I emailed him on March  and again on March  emphasising the fact that every day of delay was allowing more viral spread, meaning overwhelmed NHS doctors and nurses would soon be making agonising treatment decisions.Mr Lamont believes that local voices should be heard \"at the highest levels\" and is diligent with correspondence. I have asked him repeatedly whether he acted on my March emails. Unfortunately, he declines to answer that question, instead replying tersely on June : ldquoI point out again, the decision on when and how to impose lockdown restrictions here in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government. Do you dispute that Irsquove been shaken by such a reply from my elected representative. It leaves me feeling more vulnerable and totally unrepresented by the MP who, in mid-March, I asked three times to forward on to Westminster my urgent and relevant health concerns regarding all UK citizens.Earlier action by Boris Johnson in March would have made such a dference.

UK allowed business to continue as usual and inexplicably stopped all virus testing in the community on March  despite WHO advice to \"Test. Test. Test.\" Denmark is now out of lockdown with a Covid death rate of  per million population. UK has an exhausted care system, a death rate of  per million, and worryingly high rates of new infection as we struggle to emerge from lockdown. It is a tragedy that could have been avoidedMr Johnson had listened to all scientic advice in March.Dr Mary Gillies, Selkirk.ANDY Maciverwrites that we should have some empathy with our senior politicians as they have to make very dficult decisions at this time.Indeed they do have very dficult choices and one of the easiest for Mr Johnson to make was to sack Dominic Cummings for taking us all as fools for driving to Barnard Castle to check his eyesight. Maybe he needed them checked to read his marriage certicate. Oh yes, it was that date.Funny how the Government and Mr Johnsonrsquos popularity has plummeted since making that choice.Sorry Mr Maciver, any sympathy I had for Mr Johnson has disappeared. He is not a leader, he continues to wing his policies.Willie Towers, Alford.ANDY Maciver urges us to give our leaders our support, as human beings in the same boat as we all are, but with much greater responsibilities than most of us, instead of heaping opprobrium on them.Hes got a good foundation for this attitude.

The th of August has to be a starting point and we build on that as quickly and as safely as wersquore able to do.Scottish Tory education secretary Jamie Greene said: ldquoWe are now several months into this crisis and thatrsquos more than enough time for the SNP to have come up with a nationwide plan to maximise in-class schooling.ldquoInstead, all wersquore seeing is more confusion, mixed messaging, and a chronic lack of leadership.ldquoParents and teachers wonrsquot know who to listen to ndash the First Minister or the education secretary ndash as their stories are increasingly dferent.ldquoCouncils are being left in the dark and left in the lurch.ldquoThis was a desperate attempt by Nicola Sturgeon to wrestle back control of this issue from John Swinney, who she clearly thinks has made a mess of things in recent days.ldquoAs a result of this shambolic incompetence, right across Scotland children will miss out on huge swathes of education, and parents will simply be unable toto work under current SNP plans.ldquoThis is much than attainment, this is going to hamper Scotlandrsquos economic recovery in the short, medium and long-term."},{"url":null,"title":"blackford-best-brexit-deal-scotland-independence","story":"Boris Johnson said there was a ldquovery good chance of reaching a trade deal with the European Union, following his virtual summit meeting with officials today.However the SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the Prime Minister is risking sending the UK into further economic turmoil with no deal, or a bad deal, and suggested the best option for Scotlands relationship with the EU is independence.The Prime Minister called for an agreement to be reached by the end of July, however European Council chief Charles Michel said the bloc would not be pressured into buying ldquoa pig in a poke.Brussels still insists the UK must commit to a ldquolevel playing field, preventing the UK straying too far from Brusselsrsquo rules on workersrsquo rights, environmental protections and state subsidies..The UK lsquos chief negotiator David Frost has said that the country is only asking for the same deals already agreed between the EU and other countries such as Norway and Australia.Speaking in Downing Street, Mr Johnson said he believed a deal would be concluded by the end of the year when the current transition arrangements expire ldquoprovided we really focus now and get on and do it.He suggested that Brussels wanted to drag the talks out in an attempt to push them towards the December  deadline.It was ldquovery clear what the UK needs from the deal, he said, adding: ldquoWe canrsquot have the involvement of the European Court of Justice in this country, we canrsquot have a system whereby we continue to have to obey EU law even when wersquore out of the EU and wersquove got to get a great deal for our fish.ldquoI donrsquot think wersquore actually that far apart, but what we need now is to see a bit of oomph in the negotiations.In a joint statement, the two sides said the earlier rounds of talks led Mr Frost and EU negotiator Michel Barnier had been ldquoconstructive but ldquonew momentum was required.The EU side was represented in the summit by Mr Michel, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European Parliament president David Sassoli. Mr Johnson was joined by Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, Mr Frost and the UKrsquos ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow.Mr Michel said a ldquobroad and ambitious agreement was in both sidesrsquo interests but the level playing field was ldquoessential.He added that the EU was ldquoready to put a tiger in the tank but not to buy a pig in a poke.Asked about the possibility of a ldquocut-off date on the talks to give businesses some certainty about what to expect from January , Mr Johnson said: ldquoWhat we already said today is the faster we can do this the better, we see no reason why you shouldnrsquot get that done in July.ldquoThe issue is very clear, we fought an election based on these ideas, the manesto was very clear.He added: ldquoI certainly donrsquot want to see it going on to the autumn winter as I think perhaps in Brussels they would like.A series of weekly talks with the EU will now take place at official level for five weeks, commencing on June , looking at detailed technical issuesWestminster leader for the SNP Ian Blackford said Scotland was being ignored by Downing Street, and warned that the Prime Minister was ldquotaking the UK head-first towards a Brexit disasterwhich could damage ldquoour economy with the growing risk of a devastating bad deal or no-deal outcome.He said the ldquoTory Brexit obsession was evidence that ldquo the only way to protect Scotlandrsquos economic interests and our place at the heart of Europe is to become an independent country. and added: ldquoYet again, the Prime Minister is putting the narrow Tory Brexit obsession ahead of his responsibilities to protect peoplersquos jobs, businesses and living standards. He must think again, pause his failed talks and agree to the two-year transition period extension on offer.ldquoScotland has been completely ignored by Westminster throughout the Brexit process.ldquoThe UK already faces the worst economic crisis in decades. It would be reckless in the extreme for the Tory government to pile a Brexit crisis on top of coronavirus, which would put even more jobs and businesses at risk and cause unemployment to soar.ldquoThe Tories are pushing Scotland and the UK towards a longer, protracted recession, which will cause lasting damage to millions of peoplersquos incomes and livelihoods.Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, added: \"Boris Johnsonrsquos arrogant assertion that he wants a Brexit deal rushed through in a few weeks shows he still doesnrsquot care about the impact a bad deal could have on peoplersquos lives.ldquoAt a time when the UK is facing the deepest recession for  years, it is unthinkable that the government would rush through a half-heated deal, or worse get no deal at all.ldquoA rushed, bad Brexit deal would hit our NHS, jobs, and the economy. It would impact the most vulnerable the hardest, making le more dficult for those already struggling to make ends meet.ldquoJohnson should stop with the bravado. Liberal Democrats will continue to call on the government to extend the transition period and commit to ensuring we agree a Brexit deal that leaves no one behind.\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Councilhas said it is hoping it can start accepting more items at the re-opened recycling centres, from next week onwards.

Unsurprisingly, as time passes so businesses from across the region are increasingly seeking clarity on a wide range of issues vital to their survival.With Phase  of the unlocking process due shortly, the FSB believes that this is the perfect time for smaller businesses to question Mr Ewing on what the Scottish Government is doing to support businesses over the next year.The FSB’s Highlands  Islands Area Leader and director of the Kylesku Hotel, Tanja Lister, said: “We know how anxious businesses are becoming about their abilities to survive in this new world and, given that the virus is unpredictable, they clearly want as much clarity as possible so that they can plan their survival strategies once unlocking takes place.“In particular, they want to know when and how unlocking will take place, what they must do to comply with distancing protocols, how local communities will be persuaded that the time is right to unlock, and the nature of the Government-backed business support that will be put in place to carry the regional economy though to next Easter and beyond.“Nobody should think that businesses can go from nought to  in a few days – it will take a long time for them to recover, and many will need ongoing support from governments, public agencies, other businesses and, very importantly, the general public, for many months to come.“We know how heavily engaged Mr Ewing is in his vital role and we are delighted that he is giving up his time to take questions on Monday. This is the perfect time for him to meet Highlands  Islands businesses and we are looking forward to a very productive hour with him.”Questions must be submitted in advance and we will ask as many as we can in the allotted time, say the organisers. Participants can also submit comments during the meeting using Zoom’s ‘Chat’ .The event is free and open to all businesses.

Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches.Speaking in the House, Mr Carmichael said: “I hope that when he s to the department today he will tell his officials and tell also the Post Office senior management that this review just isn’t going to cut it.#This is a complex case and that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry, and that is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now ”Responding for the Government, Paul Scully MP said: “The point is the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.#I do not want an inquiry that lasts  years and that sub-postmasters are going to come back time and time again with no justice. This is something that I have been pushing on from the moment that I found out the detail about it, and that is why I am going to drive this through to make sure that the answers are heard and that independent chair gets to the bottom of this and gets some answers.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The minister’s response was inadequate. Postmasters are vital parts of our communities, especially in the outer isles where they sit at the heart of island le. This scandal and the Post Office’s woeful reaction to it have undermined confidence in the treatment of our postmasters. The government must do more to repair that trust, starting with a proper judicial inquiry.“It bears repeating that local post offices have proven their essential role once again during the Covid- crisis. We have to ensure that future postmasters are not put off by this scandal.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orwe the providers are the birds, desperately hoping for an income, fat and seed to feed us after an extra-long winter.Social media fluttered with posts from businesses stating ‘we hope to be open’, the sensible ones being aware of Fergus Ewing’s proviso: “This date cannot be definitive and is conditional on public health advice and progression to phase three of the route map.”While a lot of work will need to be done, practicalities and protocols worked out, how do we clean rooms, how do we ‘meet and greet’, do we leave rooms fallow for  hours, do we use PPE when cleaning, I think as much work needs to be done in the wider community.How are the visitors going to eat, how are they going to shop I have seen some quite lax adherence to protection in local shops with face covering usage fairly minimal at best.We have probably got away with this behaviour due to the low numbers of cases outwith the care home community.This could change with an influx of people from away. Any vigilantism must be directed at ourselves and the messages we put out when we go about our day to day business as lockdown eases.Protect ourselves and others.Those vulnerable people we have been looking after with prescription runs and message collections, some of them might not be looking forward to an influx of staycationers.What  are they bringing with their much-needed cash None of these problems are insurmountable. Guidelines will be available and in the month ahead, confidence will hopefullyand a dose of common sense will go a long way to making things work.The talk is that furlough is just the precursor to redundancy, and the economy will be struggling in all sectors.The knock on is likely to be fewer visitors with less money, and of course with the quarantine enforcement for overseas visitors, there won’t be many coming from afar.I hope the tourismwill be a trickle, then a stream, in order for us all to get used to how it can work.Despite being involved in the business I actually hope that it never s to the flood, the tsunami of the last two years, where the danger was the destruction of our environment and our community.We were perhaps too busy making money to spend time with our families, friends and neighbours.While loving the quiet roads, the time spent with family, and the time spent re-evaluating prioritiesit couldn’t last for ever.The savings are being eaten into, the government assistance also doesn’t last forever, reality looms.There is an economic model of price and product determination, that everybody is acutely aware of called “supply and demand’.In recent years as the visitor numbers went through the roof, and perhaps became unsustainable, bed provision rose, spare rooms developed, cabins and pods built, garages renovated.Still numbers rose, and so did the prices, a simple correlation.There is likely to now be an oversupply of bed provision, the economists would foresee a reduction in price as people compete for a smaller market.This may at first bring prices down to a realistic level, there was perhaps a danger that Skye was becoming a rich person’s destination.A possible consequence may be what I have heard described as “a race to the bottom”, with what is effectively a price war, and possibly falling too far.This when the product suddenly has become more expensive to manage, rooms costing more to clean, hotels only being able to cope with fewer guests to comply with social distancing.We have a free market economy, there is little or no control, people can charge what they like, and undercutting is a valid entrepreneurial technique do something better cheaper#!I mentioned weeks ago, for many, the tourist dollar is the icing on the pension cake, a second income to a professional wage.Perhaps there is a fine line between need and greed.Some tourist operators have been forced to use food banks and needing help from the Skye Community Response group during lockdown.As business s, and these people can begin rebuilding their livelihoods, perhaps others have to decide what their own needs are.The pension or the wage might be enough.One of the reasons I love starlings is the incredible murmurations they create in autumn, just before roosting in the evenings.These bickering birds who flutter and jostle around the trees, for twenty minutes or so before descending to reeds and branch to sleep, put on a display with no equal in nature.Moving in unison, they create patterns in the sky, shapes, forms, dance.

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

The film follows a group of four young misfits as they set out to find the treasure of a long-lost pirate on their last weekend living in their under-threat neighbourhood.A noisy, high-energy and light-hearted watch, it was the perfect feelgood film for a sunny Sunday evening amid the current doom and gloom of the world.Among the spectators were die-hard fans of the movie, Nicky Kells and Michelle Currie. and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"Nicky Kellsand Michelle Currie from Ballynure FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNicky Kellsand Michelle Currie from BallynureThe couple, who travelled from Ballynure for the occasion, say they were glad of the excuse to leave the house and have some sense of normality for the evening.We love The Goonies, it#s one of my favourite movies. To see it on a big screen will be great, said Nicky . It#s really strange that we haven#t been able to get to the cinema in so long. So, it is nice to just get out to do something dferent is a novelty now.Waiting patiently for the film to get under way, the Co Antrim pair praised the smooth running of the event, which was organised by local firms Red Box Media Productions and MayWe, a Belfast-based event management company.Cars were positioned two metres apart in line with social distancing guidelines and the field was lined with portable toilets for convenience, each one monitored by stewards and cleaned after every use.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseReporter Jenna Gardiner FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappReporter Jenna GardinerEven as soon as we pulled in we were impressed, it#s been very well organised, Nicky said. I couldn#t believe how clean the toilets were, especially for an outdoor event.The view is cracker with the screen positioned just in front of the Harland  Wolff cranes, added Michelle . The setting is just lovely.The couple say they are keen toto the drive-in cinema should it continue when the rest of normal le resumes.Compared with those distant memories of my pre-Covid cinema trips, watching from the car was a convenient experience.While drive-in cinemas are a relatively new attraction to Northern Ireland, borne out of the pandemic, I was struck by how nostalgic an experience it was to join hundreds of others to spectate from the car.Perhaps that#s down to the fact I#ve only ever seen it done in Grease, or due to the now-dated special effects of the film, but the whole ritual certainly felt like a blast from the past.One new novelty of the experience was the lack of distractions, with no coughing or sneezing, people using their phones or pesky whispers to contend with.Accessed by radio, we controlled the sound and volume ourselves and could recline our seats as far as we liked.Another plus for the spectators is that by attending the screening they were also helping in the fight against coronavirus, with all profits going towards vital research at Queen#s University Belfast.Without any indication of adate for conventional cinemas in Northern Ireland, the drive-in event offers a new prospect for movie buffs across the country.Around , cars attended throughout the day for four dferent classic movies, including The Lion King, Frozen  and Back To The Future, with an additional three films shown on Saturday.Certainly a fun way to spend an afternoon, the event kicked off with an interactive quiz to test our knowledge of The Goonies before the film started. Afterwards, it ended with a round of applause - or rather, a honking of horns - as the credits rolled on the Steven Spielberg classic.

Travellers are feeling the impact, but sotoo are pilots and flight attendants. #It#s hard after  years to write up my CV and think where it leads to outside aviation#Former Flybe pilot Nigel Best , from Ballymena, has worked for the airline for  years and transferred from his role as an engineer to become a pilot six years ago. He is married with two children and a grandson. He worked in Michelin as an apprentice after leaving school and then became an apprentice engineer in the RAF.I served for  years with the RAF and then joined Jersey European as a CAA licensed engineer. I did that for  years, but I always had my pilot#s licence and I built upon that and became a flight instructor, he says.Nigel says initial flight training costs £,: It#s a big investment. When you are a pilot it#s not just like you get a licence like a driving licence. Every six months you#ve got to do a simulator test and there are always tests and evaluations. My licence now will only last for a year and I will have to renew it at my own expense.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNigel Best  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNigel Best On his days off he also worked at Woodgate Aviation for the Air Ambulance on a voluntary basis.After six years as a pilot his last flight was on March , bringing passengers from Manchester into Belfast.I know everybody puts so much effort into their job, but everybody within Flybe, from the cabin crew and engineer to the pilots, worked so hard. It was also a very family-oriented business. Everybody knew each other and everybody was there for each other. People had worked there for  years or more and they loved serving the people of Northern Ireland, he says.Since lockdown, Nigel has been doing DIY projects using his engineering skills, and has been looking for work.I#ll probably go back to engineering, there#s more likelihood of me getting an engineer#s job in Northern Ireland, he adds.He says the highlight of his career was when he flew his family on a scheduled flight to London City Airport for his we#s grandmother#s th birthday, fulfilling her letime ambition of visiting the Cha Flower Show.He also loved sharing his knowledge as an engineer with first officers working alongside him in the cockpit.To me it was just the sheer fact that I never went to sleep at night dreading that I had to go to work the next morning.The worst aspect was always the threat of redundancy. Aviation is always the first industry that reacts quickly to a downturn and an upturn. Because of the cost in aviation you have to act very quickly and those who react the quickest are the ones who survive.It#s hard after  years to write up my CV, look at all the experience in my background and think where this leads to outside aviation.Nigel believes that Flybe employees lost their jobs as a result of Covid- because Virgin Atlantic, which had bought over the business, decided to focus on its own brand.Flybe was connecting people, families, businesses within the British Isles and that has now been lost, he adds.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePhilip Land with his late father Paul FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPhilip Land with his late father Paul‘I would cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again... it was an amazing experience but things will be dferent’Philip Land , from Lisburn, was a flight attendant for Flybe until the airline went into administration just before lockdown. He is married to Karl. Following a career in hospitality, Philip was working at a catering company in Belfast City Airport when he was encouraged to apply for a cabin crew position by crew stopping for lunch.“I’d always wanted to be a cabin crew, but because of my age and height, I didn’t think I would be suitable,” he says.“But I went to the assessment day and passed — that was three years ago and I was a cabin crew member from March that year. It’s been the most brilliant time.”Philip describes Flybe’s employees as being like a family. “My best day was the first day I flew on what is called ‘fam day’, short for familiarisation, when I had to fly home in the jump seat, the third seat in the cockpit, for the whole of the flight from Southampton to Belfast and that was absolutely amazing — it’s not something that you normally get to do, to see what the captain and the pilots do.“You get to see the take-off and the landing and you’re watching the ground coming closer and closer — it’s absolutely amazing.”Philip, a rep for Unite the Union, was on a health and safety course in Carlisle when he learned that Flybe had closed down.“I spent all night talking to members on the phone — they were like brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts. It had to be the worst day of my le, the loss of that job,” he says.“I never realised until it was coming to an end how much it takes over your le. I loved going to work.“The company went into administration on March  and the following week, the country started to go into lockdown. We were dealing with our members, trying to get them sorted, updating their CVs and making sure all monies were arranged. We had a two-week period of manic activity, trying to get people organised, and all of a sudden it was locked down and you couldn’t do it anymore.”After going into lockdown, Philip fell ill and was in self-isolation for nearly four weeks.“I had every symptom, other than the cough — a sore chest, my body was so sore, I couldn’t even get out of bed most days. I don’t know whether it was the mental exhaustion after two weeks of living on adrenaline rushes. Karl had a cough, but nothing untoward, but he wasn’t right — we both definitely weren’t right.“I’ve had many, many bad colds when I was flying — you pick up anything that is going around — but that had to be the worst. “Six of us that had been in the same group all had symptoms and we all feel we had some form of coronavirus, but you can’t get tested as you are just a number to this government.”After recovering, Philip has spent the time in lockdown painting and decorating and taken part in weekly Zoom quizzes with friends, but has barely left the house.“My father, Paul Land, was a Cha pensioner in London and he got Covid and died on April . My brother had to arrange a virtual cremation for him,” he says.“Things have been hard. I am a mental health first-aider, which has been a lesaver for me, because there are times when you just think... why ”Philip says that unless Flybe s or is replaced with a small regional airline, he can’t see himself being able to work in the airline industry again.“My concern is that there is so little connectivity now with the mainland from Belfast. We don’t have the bridge Boris Johnson is talking about, we don’t have a tunnel to get across. WI’d cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again. It was an amazing experience, but it’s going to take time for it to settle down and how are they going to work with self-distancing “If they’re doing a deep clean for each flight, that’s at least an hour. Things are going to be very dferent.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year‘If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over...but I may go home to my family’Caoimhe Leigh Harkin , from Co Tyrone, has been a flight attendant with Emirates since last March and has been in lockdown in Dubai. She originally graduated in journalism in  before working as a travel journalist in Dublin, but was keen to travel before settling down. She was hired by Emirates in February last year after attending an open day.“Before all of this, the job has been wonderful. I have loved the travel and the whole experience,” she says.“I’ve been to Australia, Italy, South Africa, and I’ve done some amazing things. I’ve been to Bali, Mauritius — I’ve been to places I would probably never have been toI hadn’t taken the job. I thought, ‘If I don’t do this now, I’ll never do it’.“With Emirates, every day is so dferent. You have  days off a month in Dubai and you do seven or eight flights, some of which are layovers, or they could be turnaround flights, where you leave Dubai that day and come back that night.“It’s been the best year of my le — there’s literally no words to describe it. The hardest thing is jet lag and being sleep deprived — you just sleep when you can. But when you’re going into a layover for  hours when it’s somewhere you’ve never been before, you just have to go and see that place and do without the sleep.”Caoimhe lives in an Emirates-owned accommodation tower along with many other crew members.“We’ve made a wee family out here — me and my best friends live in the towers beside each other. Every day is dferent, there’s something always going on in Dubai.”At the start of the pandemic, the city was in -hour lockdown with tighter restrictions than in the UK, she says.“We needed a permit even to get groceries and you only got the permit once every three days. You had to input your UEA identication andyou went before your three days was up, you got declined.

They literally have drones going round the streets sterilising them —only everywhere could do it the way Dubai does it,” Caoimhe says.Her last flight was on March  and she has been in lockdown ever since, and found it hard to adjust to a less active lestyle.But with the relaxation in lockdown, she was able to book a hotel in the city and stay there for five nights with some friends.“It has a suite with a private pool and the views are amazing over the skyline of Dubai,” Caominhe says.“We have our own rooms, but we’re able to spend time together, which is nice. The hotel is only for residents of Dubai. We have to be in by pm and can’t leave the hotel until am, and we’re still sticking to the guidelines because we’re not in one room. The past five days have been really nice, but it’s back to reality tomorrow.”Caominhe says Emirates is bringing staff back in phases.“There’s a lot of negativity in the news about other airlines, but Emirates don’t have that at all... they’re making people stay on top of their safety procedures before we get started back.“We’re on standby and you have to be preparedyou’re called for a flight. If you’re called to do a flight, you have to quarantine for  days afterwards.”But she says she’s not sure what to do in the long term. Her contract lasts for three years and Caoimhe wasn’t intending to do a second contract afterwards.“If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over and I didn’t plan to stay longer. I’m trying to be smart about it, but my decision may be going back and spending time with my family — maybe it’s a sign,” she says.

government pending the approval of their parties.The document will be circulated to their parliamentary party members in the coming hours before meetings expected to take place this evening.It comes as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar revealed that he and Micheal Martin have come to an agreement on a rotating Taoiseach system, indicating Mr Martin will be the first person to hold the office.The future of Covid- unemployment payments and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Schemewill be among the first tough decisions taken by the proposed new government.Decisions on the both schemes brought in to help people who lost their jobs in the coronavirus crisis and shield those who kept them will be highly contentious.Their prioritisation in the Programme for Government underlines the challenges that will face the new coalition from day one of a new administration.The future distribution of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will be based on the principles of fairness and equality.Also included in the July Stimulus will be new taskforces including ministers, independent experts and stakeholders, for each sector of the economy.The enactment of legislation for a new €bn Credit Guarantee Scheme is also listed among immediate actions.A National Economic Plan is to be set out in October on the same day as Budget  for charting the longer-term jobs-led recovery.Underpinning the National Economic Plan will be the need to protect the Irish workforce and economy to the greatest extent possible from future shocks due to another public health crisis, Brexit, digital transformation and climate change,

helping people currently unemployed due to Covid- back to work.The aim is to create a stronger, fairer and more sustainable economy prepared for the next phase of disruptive technologies and on a pathway to a low-carbon future.The jobs-led recovery will depend on Ireland#s ability to secure markets for our goods and services and attract investment into the country.The document also highlights the importance of a just transition as fossil fuel dependence is ended and there is an ambition to create economic opportunity through climate action.There is a plan for a Recovery Fund as a targeted stimulus to increase domestic demand and employment though the document does not say how much it will be.It is to be available this year and in  and  and have three elements - Infrastructure Development Re-skilling and Re-training and Supporting Investments.Immediate action will be the July stimulus which will set out a pathway for the future of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.In relation to taxation the plan is to target areas like carbon, sugar and plastics for hikes.It says: We will utilise taxation measures, as well as expenditure measures, to close the deficit and fund public servicesrequired.In doing so, we will focus any tax rises on those taxes which tax behaviours with negative externalities such as carbon tax, sugar tax, plastics etc.Other measures in Budgetary Policy include:Continued commitment to the .pc corporation tax rateA commitment to negotiate a new public pay dealA new regime to ensure the accountability for senior banking executivesNew legislation

programme for government states this will now be deferred.A Commission on Pensions will examine and report on the issue by June  and the new government will act on its recommendations before the end of next year.The State pension age was a isive issue during the general election campaign and Fianna Fáil had insisted during government formation talks that the increase should not go ahead.During the negotiations, Fine Gael pushed for the pension age to increase as had been planned.However, the new programme for government states: “Pending the report of the Commission on Pensions and any subsequent Government decisions on its recommendations, the State Pension age will remain at  years and the increase to  years will be deferred.”The document says this “will allow full consideration by Government of any permanent changes”.Meanwhile,  year olds who are required to or chose to retire early will be able to receive an ‘Early Retirement Allowance or Pension’ at the same rate as jobseekers benefit without a requirement to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.The Commission on Pensions will also examine “sustainability and

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

When he came out of the changing room bearing a grey hoodie, with the rest of his team-mates in black and white, you wondered had he even got a jersey. But whatever he dreamt about on the night before, whatever he thought about over dinner, he wouldn’t have believed he would have scored an injury-time goal to win the trophy for his new club and win the man of the match award. googletag.cmd.push That’s exactly how it panned out. The sides level at - apiece, thirty seconds of injury-time played, and a long ball is spilled and flapped at by Ronan Tracey in the Foreglen goal. Poaching on the edge of the small square , as he did time and again in the green and gold jersey, it was a simple task for O’Kane to punch home the winning goal. Some ironies are just written in the stars. This one came in spite of every single ounce of effort Foreglen had to give. Kevin O’Connor was O’Kane’s partner in crime since the two were knee high. They tormented defences in Intermediate football for years. They fought shoulder to shoulder for the green and the gold. googletag.cmd.push O’Connor played like a man possessed. He played like a man who wanted to show the world he didn’t need a partner. The Foreglen forward took Rian Kealey, a superb player, to the cleaners. O’Connor ended up with five points and set up his side’s goal in a magnicent display. That goal, made by O’Connor and finished by James Brolly, looked as though it had swung the balance in the favour of the underdogs with just four minutes to go. Having been behind from the th minute of a rather stagnant first half, Foreglen had worked incredibly hard to stay in touch with the Magpies. A combination of wasteful finishing from Eugene Kelly’s menand superb defending from a young full-back line of Ruairi and Shane Duffy and Cathal O’Hara kept Damien O’Connor’s side in contention. This was no holds barred football. For the young Dungiven side, sprinkled with Kevin Farren, Kevin Johnston, Sean Murray and Donal McGilligan of last year’s minor team, this was probably the toughest game they’ve played, in a physical sense at least. For that, you have to give Foreglen great credit. Brothers John and Oisin Duffy were lost to their defence before the game, having set off travelling on Friday. They’re without Niall McFeely long term. To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women. In Northern Ireland the suicide rate is about double that of England, with almost  percent of our community suffering from mental health issues.” “We are all affected by mental health issues, either directly or indirectly, and its time for it to stop being a taboo subject.” A back injury curtailed Glenns early preparations and he switched rehab mode. His days comprised a series of flexibility routines. “The human body is remarkable at healing and movement is medicine. After a couple of weeks I felt I was good to go, so started doing kettlebell swings daily, building up in volume and then moving onto to the walking swing whereby i take a step forward at the top of each swing.” With over , swings during his iron mile, technique was everything. There was the small matter of managing his hands, such was the wear and tear from the kettlebell. “The kettlebell is constantly moving inside your grip so any hard skin or calluses there tend to rip off,” Glenn outlines. “So I had a weekly routine of filing, shaving and moisturising my hands. They are more rubbery that leathery. “I used a kg kettlebell. This would be fairly light for my average workout but after , swings it felt anything but light. If I do it again i may go up to a kg. The heat was the biggest issue. Within five minutes of his scheduled .am start, he was dripping with sweat. “I was wishing we started two hours earlier, sweat in the eyes and on the palms is less than ideal.” With about  metres to go, Glenn could feel blisters popping on his fingers, but the finish line was in sight. One year older, another challenge met and money raised for a worthwhile cause.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community.

reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area. Contractors then moved to Pound Lane and are now in St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Eleanor Telford, who owns Telrsquos Confectionary with her husband Alan, said that she believed that the pipe-laying would start outside her shop imminently.ldquoI suppose the work has to be done sometime and perhaps itrsquos better done now when things are still quiet, but I hope the work is completed within the time we have been told, she said.Motorists have faced some delays in St Patrickrsquos Avenue which feeds into Market Street, the townrsquos main shopping area.Phoenix hopes that by expediting its multi-million pound investment programme now, it will avoid further disruption later in the year, while also providing consumers with additional access to fuel choice before the winter period.The company insists that the safety of its staff and communities is of paramount importance, with the current pipe-laying work scheduled following ldquorobust risk assessment and the implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran also appealed to Phoenix to complete the work as quickly as possible and for road users to remain patient during the work in the town centre which he said will result in inconvenience.He said it was always anticipated the work on such a major investment in towns and villages across the district would result in some degree of disruption and inconvenience.Cllr Curran said that the arrival of natural gas provides consumers with an added element of choice when it comes to their heating needs and said the investment in Downpatrick and right across the district opens up new opportunities to thousands of homeowners and the townrsquos business community.ldquoPipe-laying on such a large scale along congested streets and town centres results in disruption and while issues have arisen in the past, Phoenix has always done it best to minimise disruption, he said.ldquoBringing forward the work in Downpatrick, especially as schools across the town are closed as part of the coronavirus lockdown measures, makes sense. However, there will be concern about this project across the business community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Sam helping lift spirits with nursing home gigs  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH musician is lting the spirits of residents at a local nursing home mdash despite the Coronavirus lockdown and heart surgery.For over  years Sam Miskelly has been entertaining the residents of Fishbourne House at Spa, with his accordion.However, his weekly visits were put on hold after he underwent heart surgery several months ago and had stents fitted.He recovered only for the Covid- virus to spread around the globe, which meant he was no longer to go inside the home.Undaunted, the  year-old former lorry driver now sets up his accordion, amplier and microphone in the garden of the nursing home and residents are still able to enjoy his tuneful medleys.Sam is a regular performer at old tyme dances at a number of local venues and it was at one of them where he met Mr William Brown, owner of Fishbourne House.ldquoOne night he asked meI would play music for the residents.

Following a prolonged period of dry weather water levels have dropped to around %. It hasnt been that low since . Picture: Michael CooperSince the beginning of lockdown, the company has seen a signicant rise in the amount of water used in homes.This rise, coupled with the dry weather, has contributed to a drop in water levels in reservoirs.Increased household use has not been offset by the closure of businesses, as many high water users, such as the agri-food sector, factories etc. have been able to stay operational during this time. NI Water Chief Executive Sara Venning said: “This recent dry spell, which has been breaking records, coupled with more people at home using more water, has resulted in a signicant drop in our water levels.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Work has been going on for some months digging a trench round the curtilage of the building, preparing foundations for a new structure, removing an important hedge, cutting roots of mature trees and damaging the ‘protected’ pillars of the boundary walls. After many weeks of pressure by residents, the planners served Tree Preservation orders and a stop notice last week, long after damage had been done. Unfortunately work has carried on regardless, and the police stand by as lorries deliver more concrete. The planners say they cannot enforce the stop notice. If that is the case, what is the purpose of a stop notice One of the most important aspects of planning is the protection of our built and natural environment, which are fragile assets that are increasingly important and at risk.Ainda Andress, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike. We will continue to work diligently to create COVID--safe environments while we rebuild services.” A copy of the rebuilding plan – Stage One can you be found on the Trust website www.westerntrust.hscni.net  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_febbcaaeefbffa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbcebaffeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
