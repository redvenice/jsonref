This map shows the approximate forward deployment of US forces in 2017. The study authors argue that the US has become stretched too thin around the globe to counter China       The hard-hitting report said the U.S. military is an \u0027atrophying force\u0027 that is \u0027dangerously overstretched\u0027 and \u0027ill-prepared\u0027 for a confrontation with China.If correct, the assessment has far-reaching implications for US allies like Australia, Taiwan and Japan who depend on American security guarantees.Donald Trump\u0027s presidency has deepened concerns that Washington would not defend its allies in the face of aggression from China. But this latest report has suggested that the United States may struggle to help even if it wanted to.Accusing Washington of \u0027strategic insolvency\u0027, the authors said decades-long Middle East wars, partisanship and under-investment have left Pacific allies exposed.\u0027China, by contrast, is growing ever more capable of challenging the regional order by force as a result of its large-scale investment in advanced military systems,\u0027 they warned.         The key elements of China’s military modernization are seen in the chart aboveUnder President Xi Jinping, China\u0027s official defense budget has increased by around 75 percent to $178 billion -- although the true figure is believed to be much more.Crucially, Beijing has invested in precision ballistic missiles and counter-intervention systems that would make it difficult for the US military to reach contested areas quickly.Experts believe that the deployment of US land-based missiles and a changed role for the United States Marine Corps will be vital to countering China, as well as collective regional defense -- with the likes of Australia and Japan doing more.In Australia, concerns have been growing about inadequate defenses, prompting debate about whether the country should think about developing nuclear weapons.Similar discussions are have periodically taken place in neighboring Indonesia.         US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper (right) recently met with Australia\u0027s Minister for Defense Linda Reynolds (center) to reassure the close ally of US support against Chinese aggression       A separate report released on Sunday by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute recommended Australia boost and harden military capabilities in the thinly-populated north of the country.\u0027Because of the significantly reduced warning times for future conflict,\u0027 wrote author John Coyne, it is likely the north of Australia will be used as a forward operating base or a \u0027lily pad\u0027 to reach conflict zones.The US military has already earmarked around US$210 million to boost a Marine Corps base near Darwin.During a recent visit to Australia, Defense Secretary Mark Esper suggested the United States wants to deploy intermediate-range missiles in Asia. So far, the Australian government has stressed it has not received a formal request to host those weapons.  Averting Crisis: American strategy, military spending and collective defence in the Indo-Pacific — United States Studies Centre"},{"url":null,"title":"Great Yarmouths Venetian Waterways reopen 2 7m restoration 1920s prime","story":"Share this article The revamp \u0027looks magnificent\u0027 and \u0027lots of people have been admiring it\u0027, according to Mary Coleman speaking at a preview of the project held earlier this year.She admitted to the Great Yarmouth Mercury that there is still lots of work to do but she is \u0027thrilled to bits\u0027.\u0027We have really been blessed with the weather.

It refers to the phenomenon by which well-meaning public figures, who seek to advertise their eco-friendly credentials – while simultaneously globe-trotting – inevitably put themselves at risk of ending up with a serious dollop of egg on their face.Just such a situation faced Prince Harry this week, after Elton John sought to defend the royal eco-warrior’s recent private jet journey to the South of France – one of four his family has taken in recent days – by announcing: ‘We ensured their flight was carbon neutral, by making the appropriate contribution to Carbon Footprint.’So what exactly is Carbon Footprint and does it deliver?The Basingstoke-based firm, which allows concerned citizens to ‘offset’ their personal carbon emissions for a small fee, is run by a husband and wife couple, John and Wendy Buckley.It’s a leading player in a rapidly-growing industry which seeks to provide a quick and easy means for customers to feel like they are combating climate change – without having to do anything more than write a small cheque.         ClimateCare is another big player in the offsetting industry. Clients are reported to include David Cameron, in his days of hugging huskiesTo supporters, carbon offsetting offers a pragmatic and relatively hassle-free means for the public to repair some of the damage caused by their modern lifestyles. It also allows celebrities (and royals) to sidestep at least some allegations of hypocrisy as they set off on yet another ski, beach or safari holiday.Yet the industry is also the subject of fierce criticism, particularly among environmentalists, who see it as a highly-unethical form of so-called ‘greenwashing’.Friends Of The Earth have repeatedly called offsetting a ‘con’ and Greenpeace have described its methodology as ‘dodgy’.The campaigner George Monbiot has dubbed carbon offsetting ‘pernicious and destructive nonsense’, comparing offsetting to the Medieval system of ‘indulgences’ via which wealthy people could buy pardons from the Catholic church to supposedly atone for their sins, without altering their destructive behaviour.Carbon Footprint were unavailable for comment yesterday, but say on their website: ‘Carbon offsetting is a way to reduce the emissions that you can’t. It both helps to combat global climate change as well as caring for local communities.’But as Monbiot and many other opponents see it, the only way to prevent climate change is to stop flying in the first place.         Emma Thompson, the Hollywood actress who recently flew First Class to London from Los Angeles to join Extinction Rebellion protests against climate changeAll of which meant that while acknowledging the good intentions, it wasn’t long before critics began to argue that Sir Elton’s claim that the private flight was ‘carbon neutral’ was nonsense.Leading the charge was Greenpeace’s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, who said carbon offsetting was not a ‘meaningful response’ to flight emissions.How, then, has such a lucrative industry developed?At its most basic level, carbon offsetting companies use money paid by clients (minus a small fee) to finance a variety of projects that take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or prevent it being emitted.Some might plant trees (which absorb CO2) in the UK and abroad, others finance projects to distribute energy efficient stoves, or lightbulbs to the developing world.One scheme financed by Carbon Footprint repairs broken boreholes – which give communities access to clean drinking water – in Uganda. That means, in theory at least, they no longer have to cut down trees and burn them in order to make fires to boil water.Another pays for trees to be planted at schools in the UK. Beneficiaries have included Ivybridge Primary, near Twickenham Stadium, where nearly 1.300 saplings were planted on the border of a playing field last year, and an unnamed school near the Hertfordshire studios where the new Spider-Man film was made.It was recently given 72 saplings by Carbon Footprint client Sony pictures (one for each day of filming) to turn into a native hedge.Projects may also support solar energy or wind farm schemes, or pay to protect threatened areas of the Amazon rainforest from logging. An auditing process then establishes how much carbon each project has ‘offset’ each year, for example by working out how much CO2 an inidual sapling will convert into oxygen. Customers can then tailor their payments accordingly.Buy a Virgin Atlantic flight to New York, and you will be told that you are producing 0.96 tons of CO2. For £7, on top of your ticket price, a company called ClimateCare will ‘offset’ those particular emissions.ClimateCare is another big player in the offsetting industry. Clients are reported to include David Cameron, in his days of hugging huskies, and Emma Thompson, the Hollywood actress who recently flew First Class to London from Los Angeles to join Extinction Rebellion protests against climate change.Founded in 2007, it now puts between £10million to £20million a year into its projects.Carbon Footprint – as favoured by Elton John – is also doing well: last year, its assets increased by £375,000 to £1,531,775.All very well and good. Yet critics regard their lucrative line of business with disdain.‘Offsetting is a con,’ Friends Of The Earth has stated. ‘It encourages businesses and iniduals to carry on polluting when we urgently need to reduce our carbon emissions. It allows people to develop the mindset that it’s OK to carry on polluting if green schemes in far-off locations make up for it.’         Friends Of The Earth have repeatedly called offsetting a ‘con’ and Greenpeace have described its methodology as ‘dodgy’ (stock image)Sceptics point out that many offsetting schemes take ages to have a significant effect. Newly planted trees may never mature, and even if they do, won’t reach peak CO2 reducing powers for decades, whereas the carbon we release by driving or flying is going into the atmosphere immediately. They also say the real effect of offsetting projects is hugely tricky to measure, since it’s never entirely clear how much carbon is actually taken out of the atmosphere by them.Meanwhile, you never really know whether the wind farm financed by donations from offsetting firms might have been built anyway.‘Just as in the 15th and 16th centuries you could sleep with your sister and kill and lie without fear of eternal damnation, today you can live exactly as you please as long as you give your ducats to one of the companies selling indulgences,’ Monbiot has written.Others have criticised the impact of offsetting projects on indigenous communities, likening it to a form of colonialism.In 2017, a controversy erupted in Ecuador over a Californian project to turn 2.5 million hectares of forest into a reserve. Indigenous people were told they were no longer allowed to gather firewood or hunt in traditional tribal areas.Then there are environmental problems caused by some carbon-capturing trees. A 2017 report by Kew Gardens observed that huge ‘monoculture’ plantations of thirsty eucalyptus, a plant that is especially good at soaking up CO2, were using up valuable water required by developing communities, and also increasing the danger of forest fires, since they are highly flammable.Yet for all that, offsetting continues to grow. While supporters accept that some providers, particularly in the early days, were ‘cowboys’, they say the industry has improved its methods considerably and disasters of the sort that befell Coldplay are now unlikely.Though it remains unregulated, supporters say that a trade body called the International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance, which now has 14 members, help consumers identify reputable offsetting companies, and ensures their work is properly audited.‘I am actually in violent agreement with Friends Of The Earth and Greenpeace,’ says Edward Hanrahan, of ClimateCare. ‘Like them, I accept the best way to reduce your emissions is not to take that flight in the first place. But I am also a pragmatist and believe in dealing with the world as we find it.‘So while what we do isn’t perfect, I would say that offsetting is the most effective option around today.’In other words, it’s better than doing nothing.But, as Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are doubtless starting to realise, you can either be an environmentalist, or you can fly in private jets.But no matter how many trees you plant, you will never truly be able to do both."},{"url":null,"title":"Boris promises lot oomph Brexit talks","story":" On Monday, Mr Johnson wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk and said that the backstop - the contingency plan to avoid a hard border with Ireland - should be removed from the orce deal ahead of the October 31 Brexit deadline.But Mr Tusk defended the measure and warned that scrapping it risked a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland.Downing Street said that unless the backstop is abolished \u0027there is no prospect of a deal\u0027.Mr Tusk said: \u0027The backstop is an insurance to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland unless and until an alternative is found.\u0027Those against the backstop and not proposing realistic alternatives in fact support re-establishing a border. Even if they do not admit it.\u0027Responding, Mr Johnson said: \u0027We think there is a big opportunity now for everybody to come together, take out that backstop.\u0027He added: \u0027We will be looking at all the ways in which we can maintain frictionless trade at the Northern Irish border - whether it\u0027s trusted trader schemes, or electronic pre-clearing, or whatever it happens to be, all that kind of thing, checks away from the border, points of sale or whatever if you have to crack down on smuggling, all that kind of thing - but we will come up with those solutions, or agree those solutions I should say, in the context of the free-trade agreement.         Donald Tusk, whose Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt warned time was \u0027fast running out\u0027, shared this picture of himself relaxing in a hammock on Instagram          In an interview this evening Mr Johnson acknowledged Mr Tusk\u0027s reply to his letter of Monday was not \u0027redolent of a sense of optimism\u0027 but promised to negotiate \u0027with a lot of oomph\u0027\u0027That\u0027s the way we are going to approach it. And you know what, at the moment it is absolutely true that our friends and partners are a bit negative.\u0027I saw what Donald Tusk had to say and it wasn\u0027t relevant of a sense of optimism. But I think actually we will get there.\u0027In an interview with ITV News, Mr Johnson said he believes there are \u0027plenty of other creative solutions\u0027 to the Northern Irish backstop.He added: \u0027I think it\u0027s a bit paradoxical that the EU side is talking about us putting up all the barriers, we\u0027ve made it clear 1,000 times we don\u0027t want to see any checks on the Northern Irish frontier at all, under no circumstances let me repeat again, under no circumstances will the Govt of the United Kingdom be putting checks on the N Irish frontier.\u0027By contrast, it is the EU who currently claim that the single market and the plurality of the single market require them to have such checks - I don\u0027t think that\u0027s true.\u0027I\u0027m going to go of course and see if I can explore those ideas with our friends in Germany and France and at the G7 - let\u0027s see where we get to. It may be that for now, they stick with the mantra, rien ne va plus, and they can\u0027t change a jot or a tittle of the Withdrawal Agreement.\u0027Officials in Brussels privately accused Mr Johnson of making \u0027incorrect\u0027 and \u0027misleading\u0027 claims about the situation.In public comments, the European Commission said the Prime Minister had failed to put forward a \u0027legal, operational solution\u0027 to the issue and had acknowledged that if one could be found it might not be ready in time.In his letter, Mr Johnson said while he wants the UK to leave the EU with a deal, he could not support a Withdrawal Agreement that \u0027locks the UK\u0027 into a potentially indefinite customs union and applies single-market legislation in Northern Ireland.As an alternative to the backstop, the Prime Minister said the UK would agree to a \u0027legally binding commitment\u0027 not to put in place infrastructure, checks or controls at the border with Ireland and would hope the EU did the same.The backstop should be replaced with a commitment to put in place \u0027alternative arrangements\u0027, as far as possible before the end of the transition period, as part of the future relationship between the UK and EU.But European Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said the letter \u0027does not provide a legal, operational solution to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland\u0027.\u0027It does not set out what any alternative arrangements could be and in fact it recognises that there is no guarantee that such arrangements will be in place by the end of the transitional period,\u0027 she said.An official briefing note circulated among diplomats from the member states made clear the EU\u0027s frustration with Mr Johnson\u0027s approach.The document, seen by the PA news agency, disputes Mr Johnson\u0027s claims about the Good Friday Agreement and the Irish border.It was \u0027incorrect to state that the people of Northern Ireland have no influence over the legislation that would apply to them\u0027 and \u0027misleading\u0027 to suggest that the two separate jurisdictions that exist on the island can be managed with an open border because that was only possible now due to the framework provided by EU law.Any attempt to remove the \u0027vital insurance policy\u0027 of the backstop would also be rejected by MEPs, the European Parliament\u0027s Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt indicated.\u0027The time for bluster \u0026amp political blame games is fast running out,\u0027 he added. "},{"url":null,"title":"Deputies called Kanye West neighbors fed construction noise","story":"Share this articleKanye West\u0027s Dome-Like Housing Prototypes Up-Close in New PicsKanye West\u0027s Neighbors Call Cops Over Sunday Construction at Dome Site"},{"url":null,"title":"Is really true appreciate children theyve left home","story":"Share this article Lord, how tough it can be!

No, the best time to be a parent is now, when I’m more contented than ever in my life.Both married somebody I admire and love they each have two adorable children I see what terrific adults they have become, as well as good parents — and I know I must have done something right.My adult son and daughter live nearby and I celebrate every minute of this present life — each of us free, yet miraculously connected forever.Gaping hole is now a creative spaceCelia Dodd, author.         Celia Dodd didn’t care that there was more time and less laundryAre parents really happier after their children leave home? Not if the mothers and fathers I interviewed for my book, The Empty Nest, are to be believed. When each of my three left I felt as if I’d lost a part of me. I certainly wasn’t happy — in fact I was more miserable in my empty nest than I’ve ever been in my whole life.I didn’t care that there was more time and less laundry, I just yearned to get that cosy era of family life back. It wasn’t so much the stroppy teenager I missed as the blond-haired toddler who used to clasp my hand on the beach.The reality of family life was tetchy rather than cosy, and my memories are of sitting bored by the swings, or stressed out in A\u0026ampE (we were regular visitors) or endlessly checking my phone when a teenager wasn’t home by 3am.It doesn’t sound very happy. And it’s true there was as much tedious sock-sorting as joyful cake-baking. But it was life-enhancing in so many ways. I loved it all, even the worst bits.So it’s hardly surprising that it’s taken me a few years — my kids are now 34, 32 and 27 — to get a handle on the happiness promised in this latest piece of research. The gaping hole they left eventually turned into a wonderful creative space, to use as I choose. I could throw myself wholeheartedly into work, or whatever else I chose.But perhaps the best thing is that I feel closer to my children now, even though I see them less. When they first left, I was terrified that they would only come home out of duty: it was surely no coincidence that they all chose universities as far from home as possible.But university is a weaning period, which allows parents and children to develop a new, grown-ups-together kind of relationship.Self-sufficient children make their parents happy because they’re good company.I’m free to dance round in my undiesAggie MacKenzie, TV presenter.         Not having to cook gargantuan meals or tidy up after two boys is certainly liberating, writes Aggie MacKenzieI’ve had a completely empty nest now for almost two-and-a-half years, since I moved into my current home and I’d be lying if I said I don’t relish that. Not having to cook gargantuan meals or tidy up after two boys is certainly liberating.But the real treat has been the opportunity to pursue an active sex life again!When I first split from Matthew, the father of my sons Rory, now 28, and Ewan, 24, a decade ago, I thought I’d never have a sexual relationship again. I couldn’t see how it could work with two other men living under the same roof.No one really wants to flaunt their sexuality in their children’s faces. Can you imagine trying to date with grown-up children still living at home?So while it was a bittersweet moment when they left — Rory to live with his girlfriend, Ewan, with his father — it was something of a rebirth for me.I now have what I call a ‘sort-of boyfriend’, a financier who works abroad a lot. Now I’m free to dance around in my undies when I’m getting ready for a date, and I can come in at any hour I want without any disapproving comments.Instead, when I do see my sons, usually once a week, we enjoy one another’s company, without the rows that used to be a feature when they lived at home.Both boys work as chefs, so they’ll come round on a Sunday and cook for me. They usually tell me to concentrate on pouring drinks, and take over the kitchen.Better still, they tidy up after themselves — something they never did when they lived here!Meet him off the plane? He’s 40!Ray Connolly, writer and author.The happiest times in this father’s life were when his children were little. Yes, it was murderously busy sometimes, but the day-to-day joy they brought never leaves.I managed to keep ours at home until they were in their mid to late 20s. When they did go, I pleaded with each to reconsider. They were, and still are, my best friends.Years after our third child, Kieron, had left home, he went to Israel on holiday, and was, I knew, due back on a certain flight.         The happiest times in this father’s life were when his children were little, says Ray ConnollyI checked on its arrival time, and found to my dismay it had been delayed and he would not arrive at Luton Airport until about 1.30am.How would Kieron get to where he lived in North London at that time of night? He’d probably have to wait hours for a bus or a train. There was nothing for it but to go and meet him off the plane.‘You’ve gone mad,’ Plum, my wife said, when I told her where I was going. ‘It’s nearly 50 miles!’‘I don’t mind the drive. He’ll be pleased to see me.’‘He might not. Ray, he’s nearly 40.’‘So?’‘What if he’s met someone in Israel or on the plane? The last person he’ll want to see as he comes through arrivals with a new girlfriend is his dad waiting to take him home?’I didn’t go. But in truth, children are always children to a parent no matter how old they are.It was a hammer blow to the heartLinda Kelsey, former editor of Cosmopolitan magazine.         Linda Kelsey, former editor of Cosmopolitan magazineThe nest was small — but cosy, and big enough for three. Even when the cute chick grew into a tall, gangly adolescent who used the spare room for band practice, I don’t think I experienced a moment when I looked forward to having my son out of the house.The day I waved him through departures, aged 18, as he flew off on his gap year to Western Australia, herding sheep on a quad bike, I felt utterly bereft.Call me a wimp — my husband lost patience by the time I’d been crying practically non-stop for 48 hours — but his departure was a hammer-blow to the heart.I got used to it, and I was pleased for Thomas that he was striking out with a big adventure, but contrary to the survey findings, for me the joy of being a mother, and having my son close to hand, was the biggest joy of my life.There was nothing liberating for me about his departure, not even freedom from having to do his laundry could raise a smile.Over the years as Thomas came (home for holidays during university years) and went (a year working in Spain as part of his course), for me the best times were always when he re-entered the nest.I was busy writing books, had a great social life and was embarking on a new relationship after the breakdown of my marriage. But I made it clear to my new partner that if Thomas should need, or want, to come back, there would always be a room waiting for him.I missed their lovable life forceAngela Neustatter, psychologist and writer.

As it is with our other two grandchildren — Nina, eight, and Si, five — who live with their parents in the flat below.I loved being a mother, in theory, but the reality as one who worked and believed in spending a good dollop of time with my kids, was too often like living in a food processor with no pause button.So I can understand that some parents are happiest when their children leave home. Even so, as ours left home, I missed their lovable life force.I had not thought about being a grandmother, so the delight, the vivacity, the swelling love grandchildren have delivered to us is a wonderful and new kind of love.It is undiluted by worrying about setting boundaries, managing conflict, worrying where they are, and whether we equipped them to be decent people.We enjoyed the freedom and spasmodic visits with our boys when they had gone, but life was almost too undisturbed. That all changed when my son and his wife moved in to the flat below us, with their newborn.From tiny bundles upwards, she and brother Si have been constant visitors creating a mess, wrapping themselves into our arms for story time and dazzling us with their sharpness and humour.It makes me realise children mark your younger life with fierce protective, demanding love — and grandchildren make sense of later life with a new overwhelming love."},{"url":null,"title":"Swans teach cygnet pull string sound chime request food","story":"Share this article In the past fortnight Lucky\u0027s confidence with using the bell has grown, and he\u0027s been spotted giving it a try under the watchful eyes of his parents several times.Moira Anderson, Administrator at the Palace, runs a web page dedicated to keeping people updated on the swans.On August 5 she revealed: \u0027Lucky is also gaining confidence by the bell, and following Gabriel’s example but grabbing the bottom of the bell rope.          Swans ringing bells has been a tradition at The Bishop’s Palace since the 1870s.

It involves a fist bump, a finger point and a chest pat. Most of us will never understand it, but we will see it.A photograph of the handshake is now on view in various bus stops across all five boroughs of New York City until 24 November. It’s part of a new series of images by the Bronx-born artist Elle Pérez called From Sun to Sun, which puts 16 photos on more than 100 bus stops in 13 neighborhoods in the city, from Harlem to Williamsburg.“There’s figures, portraits, the hands and environments like street scenes, fake flowers and bicycles,” said the Public Art Fund exhibition curator Katerina Stathopoulou. “Elle wanted to combine figurative work and street scenes to create a rhythm of daily life.”The photos detail Pérez’s experience growing up as a non-binary Puerto Rican in the Bronx, from flags to special meals, community leaders and pensive moments with city architecture.“It’s a decentered exhibit outside of a gallery or museum,” said Stathopoulou. “There’s something so powerful about Elle’s portraits and environments that is so engaging, which is apparent in their work.”The photo of the handshake credits its co-creators, Jay P Fury and Bryan Keith, friends of Pérez. “It’s a handshake specific to the Bronx,” said Stathopoulou. “The fist pump and the chest touch. It’s created in the punk scene, which Elle was involved with as a teenager. Elle incorporated images specific to their experience.” “Elle asked: ‘What is the daily rhythm of New York, what is the cyclical nature of life in New York?’” said Stathopoulou. “There’s a familiarity but also an abstraction in terms of the details of the city it has the presence and absence of people in New York. It’s meant to be a meditation on daily life in New York City.”The bus shelters are strategically placed in neighborhoods that are important to the artist – from the Bronx to East Harlem, East Williamsburg and Queens. “It’s not meant to represent New York as a whole but it’s Elle’s personal story of New York,” said Stathopoulou. “It’s to portray their experiences of growing up in New York, born in the Bronx and living in Brooklyn – the familiar people, the places they frequent and the experiences that Elle has daily.”The artist, who has previously documented the queer and Latinx communities of New York, told Art21 that their artwork has always been made collaboratively, “because my work has a raw, visceral relationship to emotional authenticity”, said Pérez. “People haven often recommended that I go into documentary, but I could never figure out the ethics of it.”Pérez’s photos look like they’re casually taken but they’re staged. One image shows a woman and child gardening at school. The woman is Pérez’s sister, who is an outdoor educator in the Bronx, planting raspberries and evergreen shrubs with a student.There’s also a photo of an East Harlem middle school teacher named Brendan, seated wearing a tie. “As an educator at the school, he shaped the curriculum of what students learn, one of the reasons Elle wanted to include him in the series,” said Stathopoulou. “Education is another theme.”Another photo depicts a Dominican street food dish that Pérez has found in their Brooklyn neighborhood. “The people eating the dish in the photo are all close friends,” Stathopoulou said. “Elle wanted to capture this daily activity, this routine moment of sharing a meal among friends. Brooklyn and the Bronx are both important to Elle, personally and photographically.”One of the most poignant images is a portrait of a man with the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on his arm. It says “Mi orgullo”, which reads, in Spanish, “my pride”.“Elle wanted to shoot it in black and white as an opposition against the US government’s oversight of Puerto Rico and the control they have over their economy,” said Stathopoulou. “This is Elle’s way of showing solidarity to support Puerto Rico. It ties into Elle’s experience in now, in present day New York.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97bc3d3ddf23a17a0684c336772f1b6785aaf8d4/0_272_4876_2925/master/4876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8cdeaed0f19e7e38a8ff5337afd7359","title":"british museum launches first show co curated with regional galleries","story":"Exhibition featuring works by Grayson Perry, David Hockney and Tracey Emin will go on tourDrawings by Tracey Emin, David Hockney, Rachel Whiteread and an early depiction by Grayson Perry of his transvestite alter-ego, Claire, are to go on display as part of a British Museum exhibition that could herald a new way of collaborating with regional galleries.Instead of creating the show in-house and then sending it out on tour, the museum has co-curated it with the venues it will be visiting.The process has been genuinely collaborative and democratic, said Isabel Seligman, a curator of prints and drawings at the British Museum. “It has been a rewarding, amazing experience and has given us new perspectives on the collection.”The contemporary drawings exhibition shines light on a less well known part of the museum’s collection. “They are finally going to get the limelight they deserve,” said Seligman. “There are some really fantastic works by some of the most important contemporary artists working today.”One of those is Perry, a trustee of the museum, who is delighted the show is taking place. “Since the dawn of time, drawing has been and still is a vital and central component of visual art,” he said. “How else would I get an image out of my head and into the world?”The untitled Perry drawing, made when he was around 24, is a mix of crayon, watercolour, collage and glitter. It shows his alter-ego Claire in a ra-ra skirt and hoodie, creeping away like an animal from symbols of manliness and heteronormativity.More than 50 drawings will be in the show, some of them going on display for the first time, such as a watercolour by the Belgian artist Jan Vanriet titled Ruchla. It shows a Jewish girl and was part of a series he made based on mugshot photographs of Jews deported from the Dossin barracks in Belgium to the death camps at Auschwitz between 1942 and 1944.Other highlights include a satirical Philip Guston drawing made when US president Richard Nixon was at the height of his popularity, two years before Watergate. The flaccid, testicular depiction of Nixon suggests Guston was never a fan.Seligman has co-curated the show with colleagues from the venues it will be visiting after the British Museum – the Oriental Museum in Durham Pier Arts Centre, Stromness, Orkney Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea and Cooper Gallery, Barnsley.Katy Freer, exhibitions officer at the Glynn Vivian, said working on the show had been an “absolute delight”. She added: “At a time when regional venues can struggle with funding, this collaboration with the British Museum will bring some fantastic works to Swansea and it will be great to see them with works from our own collection.”• Pushing Paper: Contemporary Drawing from 1970 to Now is at the British Museum from 12 September and then touring in 2020-21."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bd3ddb1ad88b000e2337bffa2a6b5e2bf9a493/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=496b48a9f65e02d7f8de5804a39028a7","title":"home post apartheid south africa thabiso sekgala in pictures","story":"Thabiso Sekgala’s solo show features work taken by the late South African photographer offering nuanced, alternative narratives about life in contemporary Africa.

She didn’t just write the feminist book, she wrote the movement’s bible, The Second Sex. She was an engaged intellectual who combined philosophical and literary productivity with real-world political action that led to lasting legislative change. Her life has inspired generations of women seeking independence, and this was largely attributed to her unconventional relationship with the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, which seemed like a love that didn’t come at the cost of her freedom or professional success.But in the decades since Beauvoir’s death in 1986, several waves of previously unknown letters, diaries and manuscripts have shocked readers who thought they knew her. Her letters to her American lover, Nelson Algren, showed the depth of her passion for another man. Letters to Sartre revealed not only that she had lesbian relationships, but that her lovers were young and her students. There is no doubt now that she hid both significant professional successes and serious moral failings from the story she told in her autobiographies. So what are we to make of the author of The Second Sex, 70 years on from its publication? In light of what she didn’t tell us, was she as feminist as we thought?The short answer? It depends on what it means to be feminist and which Beauvoir you have in mind. (The long answer took a book to write.) But it is now clear that Beauvoir’s most questionable moments played an important role in transforming her convictions that she condemned her own actions and renounced the philosophy that underpinned some of her and Sartre’s most infamous behaviour and that she became several different kinds of feminist over the course of her career. There are chapters of Beauvoir’s life that read less like liberated sex and more like case studies in sexism – but there are also instances where she decided to call it out, even when that meant accusing herself. Her life raises a question she had to live: are we the sum of all of our actions, or the sum of our worst?Evaluating the feminism or “worst actions” of a 20th-century philosopher whose life has been highly politicised is no easy task. In the 20th and 21st centuries, a wide variety of feminisms have emerged, often contradicting each other and frequently invoking strong progress narratives to show how previous generations’ (or even contemporary opponents’) efforts were wanting. The contents of these progress narratives vary widely depending on the political and historical context: for example, the UK celebrated its centenary of women’s suffrage (for women married and over 30, admittedly) in 2018, but French women only gained the right to vote two-and-a-half decades later, in 1944. So it was surprising to discover, when researching the reception of The Second Sex in France in 1949, to find it – and feminism in general – vociferously dismissed as passé.Gradually surprise gave way to suspicion, as a pattern emerged in reviews: again and again, Beauvoir was criticised for thinking “feminism was still relevant”, for writing female protagonists in her novels, and spending too many pages on women’s points of view. “What about men?” reviewers asked. What they liked best was the Beauvoir who told them what it was like to be with Sartre, the woman who fuelled imaginary fires with fictions of free love.Although philosophers and scholars of French literature have recognised Beauvoir’s intellectual importance and independence for decades, representations of her life have often focused disproportionately on her early adulthood, when she formed her legendary romantic “pact” with Sartre. One day in 1929, near the Carrousel du Louvre, they decided theirs would be an open relationship, forsaking no others: they were “essential” to one another, they said, but would keep “contingent” lovers on the side. In 1929, this was a curious arrangement – and it has continued to intrigue readers.Less attention has been given to the content of Beauvoir’s own philosophy, before and after she met Sartre. It is this dimension of the newly released diaries and letters that makes it especially interesting to reconsider her life and legacy. Tarnished or not, she was a woman who claimed that women’s lives should not be reduced to erotic plots – and her life has persistently been reduced to an erotic plot. And what she said about feminism repeatedly made people angry – so if she was passé, what was there to be angry about?Behind the mythical persona was a philosopher who wanted women to be “free to choose themselves”. Human beings were “the sum of their actions”, and she believed it would be reassuring to think that we each have a foreordained destiny, a unique raison d’etre that justifies our existence. But it would also be false. For Beauvoir, each human being is a becoming without a blueprint. She started developing this view in the late 1920s, before she met Sartre, and began to publish her philosophical disagreements with him in the 1940s – but by then they were both become famous in France and her ideas were often credited to him. (And outside France, important texts by Beauvoir were untranslated.)Beauvoir developed her ethics after rejecting the perspective that underpinned her relationships with women in the 1930s and early 1940s. These ethics would also lay the philosophical foundations for The Second Sex. Here, she claimed that the desire to feel that one’s existence is “justified” affects women differently than men, because women are expected to justify their existence by loving others. She argued that becoming a woman was difficult in distinctive ways, because history, literature, psychoanalysis and biology presented women with incompatible myths of femininity instead of encouraging them to become free, fallible and fully human.In 1949, her critics described her as anti-women, anti-maternal, anti-marriage. But although she thought economic work helped women, she did not think that work by itself could make women free, nor that marriage and motherhood were without value. The goal of The Second Sex was to help women cultivate a confidence in their own vision of the world – to recognise the value of their own freedom – that she later called rapport à soi (self-rapport). Because women couldn’t live up to all the incompatible myths of femininity, Beauvoir thought, they often felt like failures. Instead of asking themselves what they wanted for their lives, they berated themselves for not being what others wanted.Beauvoir’s novels were often criticised for having female characters who did not live up to her feminist ideals. But after cataloguing stifling stereotypes of femininity, Beauvoir did not want to furnish new galleries with oppressive mythical portraits. She did not want to write “strong women” who reinforced women’s feelings of ision and inadequacy. In a period when possibilities for women’s lives were differently constrained than they are today, she wanted her reader to be able to dream, fail and dream again, always in the knowledge that failing didn’t make them a failure.Whatever else it was, Beauvoir’s feminism was not triumphalist and her literary strategy was risky when she turned to writing her own story. Over the four volumes of her autobiography she hid times when she failed to live up to her own standards – and she hid some when she exceeded even her own dreams for herself. She never set out to be the woman who wrote the feminist bible, and the life she lived before she did contained several things she wished could be otherwise. But the catch about becoming is that you can’t undo the past you can only renegotiate its meaning as you look to the future.When Beauvoir wrote about her life she acknowledged that there were some “unavoidable discretions” that prevented her from telling all. She made no secret of the fact that her life was distorted by her omissions – but that is one of the reasons why it is so interesting to read it again in light of them. The word distortion comes from the Latin torquere – to twist, to torture. As a person, Beauvoir had to live with her distorted public persona for decades, and sometimes its consequences were twisted and torturous. But whether or not you like your feminism triumphalist or your autobiographies transparent, Beauvoir’s chapter in the history of feminism is one to interrogate, not ignore – because of what she did and what she thought, and also because of the way what she did has been too often used to distract people from what she thought.• Becoming Beauvoir: A Life by Kate Kirkpatrick is published by Bloomsbury (£20)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6be37a1dfd31471ccae70773dae03169644c503f/756_1320_4360_2616/master/4360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=350ce1360275872bb060190be85653a0","title":"the man who saw everything by deborah levy review","story":"The moment we speak about history, we encounter the problem of where to locate it. History, we tend to think, is behind and around us, a structure we inhabit and by which we are shaped. This partial truth, though, obscures a more intimate reality. History resides within us it arises directly from our actions and choices. Unless we remain conscious of this, the “study” of history, too often predicated on an illusion of remove, becomes an act not of interrogation, but of evasion.Deborah Levy’s exquisite new novel The Man Who Saw Everything – her seventh, and her third in a row to be nominated for the Booker prize – both unmasks and confronts this convenient denial of inidual culpability. The “Man” of the title is Saul Adler, a historian. The “Everything” is both his life and ours: his loves and disappointments, a history of 20th-century Europe viewed through, and embodied by, the fragmented memories of a single wounded mind.When we first meet Saul, it is 1988. He is 23 and researching the history of cultural opposition to fascism. On his way to meet his lover, Jennifer Moreau, he is knocked down by a car on Abbey Road in north-west London. Superficially injured, he keeps his appointment with Jennifer, a photographer who has made Saul her subject. After they sleep together, Jennifer breaks up with him, and Saul travels to East Berlin to continue his research. There, he falls in love with his translator, Walter Müller, and also sleeps with Walter’s sister, Luna, at which point the narrative breaks. When we next see Saul it is 2016 and, again, he is run over on Abbey Road. This time, though, the accident is more serious. He is hospitalised, and drifts in and out of consciousness. As he tries to recover his memories, the events of the intervening years swim slowly into focus.Saul’s life, we come to understand, functions as a kind of psychoanalytic mirror of Europe, with events in the material world finding their emotional counterparts in his disordered memories. Early on, Saul and Jennifer reflect on Marx and Engels’s observation that “a spectre is haunting Europe”. That word “spectre” will come to haunt the novel, assuming a variety of forms and functions. It is used to describe a toy wooden train in Walter’s possession – a clue to his secret heterosexual family life that shadows his brief relationship with Saul. Next, the spectre is Walter’s unexpectedly “authoritarian voice”, which conjures two distinct modes of oppression. “He was ventriloquising the voice of the state,” Saul says, “and he sounded like my father.” Towards the end of the book, when Saul attends an exhibition of Jennifer’s photographic work, he thinks: “There is a spectre inside every photograph.” The spectre, of course, is the subject: Saul himself.Levy’s singular achievement in this novel is that it is not simply these spectres that shapeshift. Saul’s entire emotional and psychological topography is unstable, questionable, and within that fluid context, everything has the power to haunt. As he struggles to bring order to his own narrative, even the smallest details recur, reform, assume new significance and meaning. When he tries to buy sunflowers for Jennifer, he is unable to find a florist that stocks anything but roses. Later, Walter’s mother smells of roses, and later still someone brings Saul roses during his convalescence in hospital. Luna, meanwhile, is convinced she is being stalked by a jaguar. When she helps Saul bury a small quantity of his father’s ashes, the emotional impact leaves him feeling “as if I had just been disembowelled by a jaguar”. When he is knocked down for the second time, the car is a Jaguar, and fragments of its shattered wing mirror become lodged in his head.This intricate patterning of objects and symbols, which becomes for the reader a kind of psychoanalytic code or interpretive mystery, allows for a complementary layering of phenomena and ideas. Ultimately, Levy is concerned with power – the forms it takes in our lives, the extent to which it is something we both possess and are subjected to. Like the haunting spectres and codified, repeating images and ideas, power keeps reappearing, and each time it does so, it takes a slightly different shape. The “authoritarian regime” of East Germany finds its mirror in the “regime” of Saul’s overbearing father. Censorship is enacted not only through the state’s control of art and writing, but through Walter’s “censorship” of his homosexual desire. Saul’s constant feeling of being surveilled while in Germany is reflected both in his role as Jennifer’s photographic subject and in the way, when Saul and Jennifer argue, he feels punished for an “unconscious crime”. Indeed, their entire relationship is an exercise in the rebalancing of patriarchal power. Not only does Jennifer make Saul her muse, thereby inverting the traditional misogynist binary of male artist and female subject, she forbids him from ever describing her beauty, even as she devotes so much of her time to documenting his.With sexual, familial and political power, of course, comes cruelty, which like everything else in this book functions at both a state-wide and interpersonal level. Saul has a “PhD on the psychology of male tyrants”, and is wounded by his own father’s tyranny, but his studies and recriminations look only outwards, affording him the luxury of displaced responsibility and pain. As Saul’s disordered memories cohere, the life that emerges is not exactly blameless. In the failed intimacy of his relationships, his role is not solely that of victim in the landscape of political oppression that he makes his subject, his responsibility extends somewhat further than that of the detached, clean-handed observer. “He doesn’t care about his own life,” Walter bluntly observes, “so he doesn’t care about the lives of others.”It has become fashionable, as interest in literary fiction is perceived to have waned, to make a case for what it is that the novel can “do” for us. Often, this is framed around the idea of empathy. Levy’s writing is, no doubt, deeply attuned to human anguish and loss, but her real talent is to remind us of fiction’s other great function: the loosening of boundaries. As Saul picks his way, tantalisingly, through the symbols and signs of his own obscured history, we find that the borders between his emotional landscape and the material conditions he inhabits, between what he feels and what he sees, between self and other, even between the inidual and collective, become eerily porous. In softening and blurring these distinctions, Levy’s implied question feels painful and apposite: how can we have any hope of resisting political tyranny when we are so tragically unable to expunge it from our personal lives?It is at this level, the level of cruelty and complicity, the level at which regimes both large and small cohere, that the bold design behind Levy’s intricate motifs and symbols becomes clear. She is asking us to consider a spectrum of harm, and where along that spectrum different incidences of cruelty might fall. Just as it is easier to study “history” as an entity distinct from our own emotional reality, so too it is far simpler and more comfortable to condemn brutality on a mass scale than it is to accept, and atone for, our own smaller acts of devastation. Perhaps, Levy seems to be saying, we have gone about things in the wrong way. Instead of resisting cruelty and injustice at a national or global level, it’s possible that each of us might need to endure the same process of disassembling as Saul, so that we can see, as in the clear light cast by this novel, the awful power we have over others, the unthinking emotional destruction we are capable of wreaking, the regimes we not only suffer under, but enforce.• Sam Byers’s Perfidious Albion is published by Faber.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield by PatLux:I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy. I then passed it on to my sister in Spain who devoured it and discussed with me scenes that resonated with her. She then gave it to my mother in northern England and when she has finished it we will donate it to the bookstall in our family’s village church for someone else to discover. I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops.MereMortal has “finally got round to starting” Howard Zinn’s “legendary” The People’s History of the United States:I’ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He’s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed “we the people”.I’m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world.LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year’s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli:Here we have a “No names, please” family of four – Ma, Pa, boy, girl – driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentariansdocumentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the “lost children” and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches. The marriage, it is announced early on, is ending, and it is projected that the parents will separate at the end of the trip, each taking one of the children.The first half of the book is narrated by ‘Ma’, and I was pulled in right away by the style of the writing. Much of it is muted, internal, Ma’s ruminations about her children and her marriage and her project ... I didn’t participate in the last two RG books because I didn’t feel I had the strength to take on Levi or Steinbeck. This book turned out to be just as harrowing. I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So … Nina Stibbe, here I come.GELBuck has “just finished” The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange:His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere!Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing:The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I’m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I’m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don’t and neither do the characters in Ubik!!Richard Flanagan’s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns:A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition.Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed:Crikey, Sebastian Barry‘s a splendid writer, isn’t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I’ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn’t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that’s mostly because I loved DWE so much.A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty.He can certainly write them.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

But this time, the stakes are even higherIn that moment you could feel British politics lurching out of its rut. Labour was about to pick its next leader – and instead of choosing the favourite, the old Tony Blair tribute act, voters were throwing a giant ner in the works. They wanted the slightly gawky leftwing underdog. They wanted a transformed party, a bigger politics. They wanted Ed Miliband.So much has changed this decade that it seems absurd to consider how at its start, in 2010, a 40-year-old father of two and whiz on a Rubik’s Cube was considered the biggest threat to the British establishment. Did that really happen? Yes, confirm the archives. He was Red Ed, a “Marxoid creep” (the Daily Mail, of course), the man with the sneaky plan to turn the country into some socialist banana republic.How laughably tinny such jibes sound today. Seen in the rearview mirror of a country hurtling towards a cliff-edge, undeterred by Whitehall warnings of shortages in medicine, fuel and food, the Miliband era looks enviable. You could quarrel and quibble with the man, of course you could pick holes all day long. But knowing what was to come, how the next couple of episodes were to play out, would you still have gone for the chillaxing blunderer who landed us in a historic mess then grabbed the thick end of a million quid from some poor sap of a publisher to stick his trotters up in a £25,000 shed and yawn out a memoir?To put it in the argot of those times, which would you prefer: chaos with Ed Miliband or stability and strong government with David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson? If ideologically you dress to the right, which do you really consider poses a greater threat to the economy: a modest tax on bankers’ bonuses or month upon month of delays and disruption at our ports? Who do you reckon really looks less of a leader: the one who critics dubbed Wallace, or the lying blond clown who styles himself as a latterday Winston Churchill?I am no nostalgic, and consider counterfactual history the academic discipline of snake-oil salesmen in tweed jackets. But the Miliband period offers serious lessons for today, as we stand on the verge of the kind of tumult few of us have seen in our lifetimes. Our problems at the end of this decade are far larger than they ever were at its start – yet there are echoes. Then as now, we were in rarely visited political territory with a coalition government using a global banking crisis to make historic spending cuts. Just like now, the Tories were hastily trying to paint their Labour opponents as dangerous radicals posing a threat to the British way of life. And this autumn, just as in 2010, the media and civil-society institutions will play a crucial role as arbiters of what is politically permissible. In other words, the treatment dished out to the previous Labour leader was but a dry run for that likely to be doled out to Jeremy Corbyn in the next few weeks.For his half-decade in charge, Miliband was treated in a way that should embarrass, if not shame, some in politics, the press and business. Disappointed that Labour had chosen “the wrong brother”, some of his own shadow cabinet immediately began whispering poison into the ears of journalists. Having never given him much of a chance, they then threatened a coup. The Tories would greet almost any of his policies by calling him a communist. A cap on energy bills? That, retorted George Osborne, was basically Venezuela. Until, that is, he saw how well the idea was polling.“I would sit with business leaders who would tell me that a 50p tax on higher incomes was a radical economic risk, that an energy price cap was radical socialism,” recalls Torsten Bell, then head of policy to Miliband and now head of the well-respected economics thinktank the Resolution Foundation. “And I would say: no, it really isn’t. You need to look up the meaning of economic risk.”When the political class realised the country largely sympathised with Miliband’s ideas they began attacking his physiology. “He doesn’t look like a prime minister,” his own backbenchers would murmur to journalists. Never mind that he’d already amassed more cabinet experience than Blair and Cameron put together when they started in No 10 a real leader had to have rolled off the public-school conveyor belt.The same tabloids that today are rightly attentive to Labour’s issues with antisemitism spent years splashing on photos of a Jewish man struggling to swallow a bacon sandwich – the subtext of which was never hard to read. The Mail famously conducted hatchet jobs on his dead dad, who’d fled the Holocaust. Even the posh papers would tut over this “north London intellectual”, this rootless cosmopolitan, before just a couple of years later clutching their pearls over May’s line about “citizens of nowhere”. No opportunity was passed up to heap ordure on the man, however unfair. My colleague Rafael Behr records how a political editor went up to the Labour leader and congratulated him on a great speech, before leaning in: “I’m sorry about all the terrible things we are now going to write about you.” In this way, a responsible, thoughtful and decent man was drummed out of frontline politics.None of this is to excuse the mistakes of the Miliband project: the immigration mugs and the gigantic slabs of limestone and in particular the failure to argue against austerity. But the bottom line is this: Miliband came not to bury capitalism, but to save it. He offered Britain a smidgen of basic social democracy, the smallest taste of redistribution: curbing zero-hours contracts and the vast power imbalance between bosses and workers the privatisation of natural monopolies and the rotting away of the public realm. By dismissing that argument, the establishment in effect sent out one unified message to voters mired in a slump: that post-crash Britain was unreformed and unreformable. That argument was to be used against the elites with deadly effect in the EU referendum of 2016.The similarities between Corbyn and Miliband are close, as people in both camps agree. One Labour frontbencher told me recently, “Our 2017 manifesto was basically the programme Miliband would have loved to have presented” – and when I ran that by a senior adviser to the previous Labour leader, they agreed. For all the hard-left epithets flung at today’s opposition, it offers the kind of European social democracy that Angela Merkel would recognise.I hear about Corbyn the same kind of criticism I heard about Miliband: he’s a weak leader, he’s too radical, he’s too north London. The difference this time around is that the stakes are even higher. Britain is heading fast down the road to economic disaster and far-right extremist politics. One wonders about those who wail at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit and Johnson staying in No 10 yet who also screw up their face at the notion of any compromise with Corbyn’s Labour. Some I remember also treated Miliband with disdain, while a few spent the Blair years urging leftwingers not to let the ideologically perfect be the enemy of the good.All I’d say is: don’t make the same mistake again. Don’t look at a Labour leader who inevitably comes with his own letdowns and flaws, and choose plummy-vowelled, confident-voiced chaos instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08cf25fb23c49bf5acbba58047ca93cbf885ac36/0_252_3638_2183/master/3638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d69dc43f3363732d8944c623e2ec31b","title":"1914 brexit calamity inevitable remainers","story":"The historian AJP Taylor argued that Europe was plunged into the first world war by the inexorable operation of train timetables. He was not ignoring historic rivalries between the continent’s great powers, nor truncating the sequence of diplomatic failures that turned competition into military confrontation. But at a critical moment, carefully laid mobilisation plans could not be deactivated. Escalation to calamity proceeded metaphorically and literally on rails.Reading about the summer of 1914 in the summer of 2019 is salutary in conflicting ways. It is a reminder to keep anxiety about Brexit in perspective. There are times when the language of bloody apocalypse is justified. Operation Yellowhammer is not one of them. But there are echoes of an older, bloodier emergency: the nation’s course irreversibly changed by a combination of cultural complacency, political pomposity, bogus patriotism and unthinking submission to the timetable.Years before Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, most statesmen across the continent thought a European war would sooner or later have to be fought. Some expected it would be glorious and short. Others anticipated the horror but said it would be spiritually purgative. As martial drums grew louder, pacifist voices grew fainter. A fog of fatalism descended. The nature of the question shifted from averting possible cataclysm to managing one that seemed inevitable.Even with a century of hindsight it is impossible to discern a point of no return, a junction at which all future paths, by whatever gradient or circuitous route, converged on disaster. If history doesn’t afford that view, how are we to know in real time when such a moment is close, or has been passed?Sometimes a weight of bad choices already made presses down on politicians, driving them deeper into an error that they see plainly enough. “I am in blood Stepped in so far that should I wade no more Returning were as tedious as go o’er,” Macbeth tells his wife at the midpoint of his tragedy.There is a less poetic version of the same thought captured on a 1964 tape-recording of a conversation between United States president Lyndon Johnson and McGeorge Bundy, his national security adviser. The choice was between propping up the corrupt South Vietnamese regime or abandoning it to the Viet Cong. One path led to military quagmire, the other to pillory at home for surrendering Asia to communism. “I don’t think it’s worth fighting for and I don’t think we can get out,” said Johnson. “It’s the biggest damn mess.”What felt like limited choices was really the limit placed on imagination by misjudgments inherited from predecessors: military hubris, ignorance of Vietnamese history, misapplication of cold war ideology to a post-colonial liberation struggle. Johnson then added his own mistakes. By the time US national humiliation was complete in the mid-1970s, it was a bipartisan monument assembled across political generations.Brexit is not a military atrocity, and there is no moral equivalence implied by comparison with Vietnam. Still, I sense that our incumbent Johnson is also trapped in the midway point of a longer tragedy, the parameters of which we are unable to grasp. That perspective will always elude the prime minister because he adheres to the 19th-century view that history is made by great men (and is enough of a narcissist to count himself among them).Intuitively, the return of parliament next month feels like the beginning of a final act. In truth, we cannot plot the current moment on a narrative arc that bends out of sight into the future. Many pro-Europeans expected that by this point public opinion would have shifted definitively against Brexit. The strategic folly of surrendering a lead role in a continental power bloc was advertised in every scene during the article 50 negotiations, alongside lurid examples of prominent leavers’ mendacity. But the great Damascene moment has not come. It might never come. An orderly transition is still available. Gloomy forecasts can be wrong. In turbulent scenarios there will be foreign capitals, collaborationist civil servants and defeatist remainers to blame.Zoom out still further, and Brexit could look like the prelude to a wider unravelling. If the European project is rattled by financial crisis and fractured by vandalistic nationalism, the debate will be whether Britain was wise to get out when it did, or criminal in failing to stay at the critical juncture. One side will celebrate Brexit as a heroic leap from the fire escape, the other will deplore it as the arsonist spark that ignited an inferno.If, by contrast, the EU is resilient and our neighbours flourish, it might still take many years for the foolishness of Britain’s self-relegation to be accepted as fact. The error will have to be composted under a layer of events, mulched by transitions of power until it beds down as consensus. Sometimes it needs a new generation of politicians to call some policy a bad business from the start because they weren’t there at the start.We are transfixed by frenzy on the stage before us: manoeuvres in anticipation of a no-confidence vote. We suppose that all possible routes are still open. Pro-Europeans must hope that there is a way back, that it is not a just a choice of gradient on the downward slide. Yet I sense fatalism creeping into formerly strident anti-Brexit voices. I glimpse shudders of dread that events are being driven not by the MPs who will vote in the coming weeks but by a critical mass of cowardice, ignorance and ideological prejudice that was reached months ago, maybe years. The past is harrying the present.It could be an illusion. I hope I am wrong. But already it feels as if decisions not yet taken this autumn are shrouded in a mist of inevitability – the accretion of a million mistakes already made. Looking back, maybe historians will judge that the point of no return, the laying of the rails, happened long before the summer of 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6acf140708aebcbf918e1bf02c2b0b329788266/0_260_5692_3416/master/5692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5dc0a693236dcc32844d448183b32b0","title":"empty nest parents children adults","story":"Christoph Becker and his colleagues at Heidelberg University in Germany have discovered that people with kids are actually happier than people without – so long as the kids have left home. Their analysis of 55,000 people aged 50 and older from 16 European countries revealed that people with children who had fled the nest had greater life satisfaction and fewer symptoms of depression than those without children.But according to an even newer cross-sectional survey of parents, this is a load of pants. Using the established qualitative research method of the one-to-one interview, I asked my partner and the mother of my children what she thought. Certainly not true for us, she said. I then extended the focus group by asking myself what I thought – nah, bollocks, I told myself.We have two children, of 27 and 25, at home, and we love having them there. Yes, it’s terrible that the oldest could not afford to move into her own place if she wanted to despite having worked as a teacher for four years. And yes, it’s sad that the youngest is autistic and promises she will never move out whatever happens. We’d love them to be independent and spread their wings one day, but in the meantime we all have a great time together.Both are happy with us, bring us huge amounts of joy (even if Alix does keep nicking the last bit of ginger and Maya insists on bursting into the bathroom when I’m on the loo) and I think we occasionally bring them joy too.This may be selfish, but the thought of them leaving fills me with a sense of loss. I see so many empty-nester parents reinventing their lives with extra dogs and extra holidays, extra courses and extra social activities. And I’m sure the dogs etc are wonderful, but to me it does sound like vacuum-filling. Empty-nest syndrome is a syndrome for a reason. And I’m yet to meet a syndrome I want to sign up to.We had our kids young. I struggled with them back then. I was resentful and totally unprepared for parenthood. I left Alix in a shop one day (so easy to forget you have a toddler). I’d take Maya into town and realise I’d forgotten her shoes when she complained her feet were bleeding. It has taken me the best part of a quarter of a century to understand my kids, so why would I want to offload them now? These days we can have adult (and childish) conversations, cook for each other, enjoy each other’s friends, tell dirty jokes, have a laugh. The house is buzzing with life. Even when we get pissed off with each other, there is an energy to it.In fact, we enjoy our adult children at home so much that four years ago we decided to get another. Jimmy came fully formed, is now 25, and is wonderful, even though he won’t let me touch the gardening any more (to be honest I should never have been allowed to touch the garden).As for the extra money we’d have if they left, I always hated the idea of cruises. The time? You make your own time. The peace? I can put headphones on. The vicarious pleasure of grandchildren? There’s plenty of room for them at home if that ever happens.Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t actually stop my children leaving home. I’ll just be super sad when they do.• Simon Hattenstone is a features writer for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e262a664a65ebcf7a3da03ff7394398fd8d4e047/0_196_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=020f77918f46c6a23d9352ca7b9dfab9","title":"how often do americans change their underwear the statistics stink","story":"The latest findings may appear disgusting at first glance (or sniff). But it’s ‘advertistics’ such as this that are the real problemBefore you get too grossed out, let me stress that this study should be taken with several pinches of salt. This was not a rigorous scientific investigation published in the Journal of Hygiene it was a survey conducted by an underwear company to generate free coverage and encourage you to buy new underwear every six months. The company does not reveal how its questions were phrased and is vague about methodology it does not specify, for example, whether the 2,000 Americans polled were a representative sample or were just college students. In brief, the results stink to high heaven. Nevertheless, the survey went viral and was reported by outlets such as Newsweek, the Independent and the New York Post.Advertistics are largely harmless fun, intended simply to insert a brand name into a cultural conversation. It’s when you do not see a brand attached to a dubious-sounding statistic that alarm bells should start ringing. You may remember headlines earlier this year claiming that half of Americans admit they use swimming pools to wash instead of the shower. The survey turned out to have been by a PR firm working for the chlorine industry – something a number of news outlets did not initially notice or report.In general, brand-sponsored studies generate a few headlines and are swiftly forgotten. Sometimes, however, they become received wisdom. Take, for example, the idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day – something your mum probably yelled at you multiple times when you were a kid. You can largely thank Edward Bernays, who is considered the “father of public relations”, for drumming this idea into our psyche. In the 1920s, Bernays (who was Sigmund Freud’s nephew) was hired by the bacon industry to increase sales. He did so by surveying 5,000 doctors and asking them if “a hearty breakfast was better than a light breakfast to replace the energy lost by the body at night”. A majority of doctors agreed and the survey results became the cornerstone of an ad campaign encouraging you to start your day with a hearty breakfast of bacon and eggs.This, by the way, is not to say that all statistics are complete bunk. A study conducted by Arwa Mahdawi LLC has found that the small percentage of people who read until the very end of an article are extremely intelligent, very attractive and definitely change their underwear every day. Well done, you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c019c73ff01288932578ba9a6a7cd7f4c895daf0/188_225_4896_2937/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6758db9ef3af1a08d5a5dab31659f7a","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of appetite","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘appetite’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘appetite’.Share your photos of what appetite means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 21 August at 10am.

I had settled into a rhythm. I wanted to be a great maths teacher – why did I have to face the burden of being a role model for LGBTQ students too?Some colleagues knew about my sexuality. If someone asked about my “husband”, I’d casually tell them the situation. And it was working OK. Then one day the stakes suddenly got bigger.I had an interview for an assistant headship in a comprehensive in a semi-rural area. I was the only candidate invited back for a second interview. My potential future boss spoke warmly about the ethos of the school and the importance of his Catholic faith. As a member of the senior team, I’d be working closely with this man. I suddenly thought: if he turns out to be a homophobe, this will be a problem. It seemed an important moment – for my future, and for his.That day, we’d moved house. I’d had to wiggle out of my jeans and into my interview dress in the car a couple of roads away from the school. I was a little flustered as well as having the usual interview nerves. I mentioned that I’d come straight from collecting the keys.“Oh, why the move?” he asked.“We need a bigger house now we have twins,” I said.He looked at me. I clearly didn’t look like somebody who had given birth to twins a month ago.“My partner had them – she’s at home with them now,” I said.And there, I had come out in my interview.There was a brief silence. “Oh, yes we have another teacher like you – she and her partner are going through IVF right now,” he said. And that was it.I know a handful of teachers and school leaders who are not out as LGBTQ at work in any way. The majority of the teachers I’ve known who were LGBTQ were out to staff but not to students. I can’t blame anybody in either group. For some it’s because they are not yet fully out in their personal lives. Others are from visible minority groups and don’t want to add something else that they feel will count against them in interviews or for promotions.Their fears are justified. Stonewall reports that LGBTQ staff across all workplaces who are BAME are more likely to lose their jobs than white LGBTQ colleagues. And for teachers who are single or currently in a heterosexual-looking relationship, being honest about their sexuality can feel like too much of a statement. Bisexual people are less likely than gay men or lesbians to be out.One school leader described her inner conflict to me: “I look at others, the confidence they have, the sense of complete ease and comfort, and I want to be involved. Then, days like today when I’m feeling overwhelmed and I’m not OK with it all, I certainly can’t be the ‘role model’. Where does that come from? Self-preservation? Protection? Shame?”In my lifetime, I’ve seen the advent of civil partnerships and same-sex marriages IVF rules have changed. In the wider commonwealth, homosexuality has been decriminalised – in India and Trinidad. But in England in 2019 there is transphobic hate crime and we’ve seen lesbian couples being assaulted on public transport in our capital city. Hundreds of parents have withdrawn their children from schools in Birmingham and protested because they didn’t want them to be taught about equality for LGBTQ people.In such a climate, I would not pass judgment on any teacher or school leader who decides not to come out. Sometimes they simply feel unsafe. How do people know they will be supported – by colleagues, by school leaders, by the government?In my own case, I had lingering memories of hearing that homosexuality was wrong and recurring thoughts of hell and damnation after a childhood of church on Sundays. And having been educated in the 80s and 90s, with the impact of section 28, which barred “promoting” homosexuality, added to my internalised homophobia. People my age, and especially those who are now teachers, are still living with the fallout from this.My journey to being open was a long one. Before I became a teacher I was a fleet engineer for a train operating company. None of my colleagues then knew about my sexuality. This was an almost entirely male environment. I split my time between the office and the train depot where pictures of page 3 pin-ups were standard. I didn’t fancy being the subject of banter.Deciding engineering wasn’t for me, in 2004 I enrolled in Teach First, the teacher training organisation. By now, fed up of being vague about my life outside work, I decided I would be out to my colleagues. It helped that I liked everyone and felt generally supported.In my early teaching jobs, my policy was to be out to other staff but not to students. This felt safe for me. I was teaching in a faith school. My colleagues were respectful, but I had nagging doubts: would the school leadership support me in the face of any comments from parents or students? I didn’t want it tested.As I became more comfortable with my sexuality in my private life – my family were mostly on my side – the same became true at work. It was easier when I went to work in a school where there were other openly gay teachers. One, a close friend, was also out to pupils and things were fine.Eventually, once I was an assistant headteacher, I came out to a Year 9 class I knew well, correcting them when they assumed I had a “husband”. They hadn’t expected me to be gay and asked a bit about if I’d always known, but the lesson carried on as normal. I thought it would be all around the school by the end of the day. But it wasn’t. I had taught for over 10 years by then. I’d been on a journey – through different schools and on a personal journey of my own acceptance.Being out has been hard at times. I’ve suffered homophobic abuse in public for nothing more than sitting next to my partner on a train or walking our dogs together. Being out is not an event, it’s an ongoing process. It’s daunting but it gets easier. For me, the journey has been worth it for my own mental health and wellbeing. But I don’t blame anyone for taking their time.The real onus should be on schools to create an environment that makes staff and students feel safe enough to be honest about their sexuality. I felt able to come out at my interview because the school had a Stonewall schools champion logo on its website. These gestures may seem small but LGBTQ people notice them and they matter.• Safety and health first. Look after yourself and don’t feel guilty if you aren’t ready to be a role model for others.• Find teachers in your school or wider network who you can be yourself with.• Coming out is a series of steps – don’t worry if you can’t take them all at once.• Get the support of your headteacher or, if you are a head, chair of governors before coming out to pupils.• If you don’t feel supported or valued as a teacher who is also LGBTQ, move to another school – check out their websites to get a feel for how they are with gender issues.• Coming out doesn’t have to be a big announcement in assembly or class.

To be honest for the first 30 minutes I think I was in a little bit of shock but then I realised it’s not everyone who is like this. Unfortunately there are some bad people who like sending messages like that but it’s important not to let it affect you.”Minutes after his spot-kick had been saved during injury time of the Championship match three direct messages from an account named “saw_pyay_htoo” registered in Singapore were sent to the Ivory Coast forward: “mother fucker” “can’t score penalty” “fucking monkey”.It was the latest incident of racist abuse to have blighted the start of the football season, with Chelsea’s Tammy Abraham and Paul Pogba of Manchester United also subjected to online discrimination over the past week having missed a penalty. Méïté decided to take things into his own hands by publishing the messages to his 35,000 followers on Instagram with the reply: “I don’t think I need to speak.”“I was very angry so I decided to share it so people could see what kind of stuff we players have to put up with sometimes,” he says. “People think they can say whatever they want, even if it’s racist. But of course they would never say that to my face. They hide behind Instagram or Facebook and that’s why I posted it.”After the Abraham incident in the Super Cup in Istanbul last week the anti-racism organisation Kick it Out issued a “call to action” to social media companies to clamp down on online abuse. Even after the offending account was swiftly deleted Méïté agrees.“Everyone should be together to try to do something about this because it is unacceptable,” he says. “We are all the same and we are playing to make people happy and to see this kind of message is not good for the sport. I want to say thank you to everyone who has sent me messages because I have received a lot of love – even from supporters of other Championship clubs. They make me feel I am not alone and these kind of messages are not only hurting me but everyone.”Now settled in Berkshire after signing from Paris Saint-Germain in 2016, Méïté enjoyed his best campaign as he scored 12 league goals despite Reading finishing 20th in the Championship last season. A hamstring injury that forced him out of the last few matches also ended up costing him a place in Ivory Coast’s squad for the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, where Ibrahim Kamara’s side were beaten on penalties in the quarter-final by the eventual champions, Algeria.That was underlined when Arsenal paid a club-record £72m to sign the forward Nicolas Pépé from Lille last month. Méïté has offered his services to the player he has known since the age of 12 when they and Tottenham’s Georges-Kévin Nkoudou were teammates at FC Solitaire in the 19th arrondissement of Paris.“He was a goalkeeper at this time so I used to practise trying to score against him. Life is weird!” he says, laughing. “Sometimes he would get bored and come out to play on the wing. He was very good.“We used to live near each other and also went to the same school so we are good friends. I’ve already tried to help him a bit. I said to him I am not far from London, so let me know.“He is very happy to be at Arsenal and is very excited for the season. I’m sure he is going to do well because he has a lot of quality.”As for Reading, the victory over Cardiff has eased some of the pressure on the Portuguese manager José Manuel Gomes after two defeats. Reading started the summer under a “soft” transfer embargo having breached the Football League’s financial fair play rules but the purchase of the forwards Lucas João and George Puscas, a Romania Under-21 international who scored twice on Sunday, for a combined £13m has raised expectations at a club last relegated from the Premier League in 2013.“I don’t know where we are going to end up,” says Méïté. “Every team is capable of surprising you.”But having swapped the gilded surroundings of PSG for the rough and tumble of Championship he has no regrets.“I’ve been here for three years and feel half-English now,” says Méïté. “The fans have always been so good to me and they have made me feel welcome. Last season was great for me but now I have to prove myself again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7177f23a5161c7369033ef6bf85266e5bdf9381/0_185_4830_2899/master/4830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0333ab4d74eb4107bcea42bd2da435d3","title":"west brom filip krovinovic luka modric croatia benfica harry potter","story":"Not for the first time Filip Krovinovic is smiling. It is bucketing down at West Bromwich Albion’s training base but after making light of the British climate and highlighting Luka Modric as his idol, the Croatian playmaker, whom Slaven Bilic made his first signing this summer, is describing how his older brother, Tomislav, and his family also became an instant hit with fans after joining them on a supporters’ coach for the opening-day win at Nottingham Forest.“They loved it,” Krovinovic says. “They liked the atmosphere on the bus. They took some beers and some fans took a picture with my brother. They asked: ‘Where are you from?’ And my brother was like: ‘We are here visiting my brother.’ They said: ‘Ah, who is your brother?’ He went: ‘Fil.’ They were like: ‘No, show me your ID, show me your ID!’ And then I saw some photos in my Instagram messages of my brother with the fans.”The room fills with an infectious laugh but it is another marker of the warmth Krovinovic says he has felt from all quarters since arriving on a season’s loan from Benfica. Krovinovic is refreshing company, gregarious and easy-going and that the 23-year-old twice checked the timings of his first major interview since signing speaks volumes for his character. He has slotted into a positive dressing room and has enjoyed his first taste of the Championship, playing all 270 minutes to date with Bilic’s side unbeaten before hosting Reading on Wednesday. Krovinovic is the first Croat to play for West Brom but he acknowledges the success of his compatriots here, such as when Modric, Vedran Corluka, Niko Kranjcar played in the Premier League.Krovinovic grew up in Zagreb but left for the Portuguese side Rio Ave as a 19-year-old before joining Benfica, for whom he played in the Europa League last season, on a five-year contract two years ago. “They are a very, very big club with great fans – it is like an invasion all over Europe,” says the midfielder, who in Lisbon played alongside João Félix as well as Raúl Jiménez, who has made a substantial impact nine miles up the road with Wolves.He is confident that Albion, who made nine summer signings, including the £4m Charlie Austin from Southampton, can achieve automatic promotion after watching them reach the play-off semi finals from afar last season. It has been a busy start to life in England for Krovinovic but last Sunday was a day off well spent he enjoyed some downtime with his mother, Snjezana, and father, Jasenko, who are visiting until the end of the month, by going sightseeing in London following victory at Luton. They checked off a few landmark attractions: Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square, where Krovinovic, who enjoys watching TV series and films in his city-centre apartment in Birmingham, made sure to get a picture with a street performer dressed as Yoda from Star Wars.• The Leeds chief executive, Angus Kinnear, says the club have no intentions of “dicking around with the play-offs” and, as they aim to build on their unbeaten start, they must get the better of a familiar face in Pontus Jansson, who returns to Elland Road with Brentford on Wednesday. “He deserves to be received in the right way,” said Marcelo Bielsa. “He was the best player of the team last year. He had a high-level season and I appreciate what he gave.”• Matty Taylor can expect an interesting reception at the Memorial Stadium on Saturday. Fresh from re-signing for his boyhood club Oxford United, the striker will return to Bristol Rovers, whom he left for Bristol City in January 2017. The 29-year-old scored 61 goals in 118 appearances for Rovers.• D-day is approaching for Bury, who have until Friday to prove to the EFL that they can pay off creditors and show adequate operational funding to avoid expulsion. Five fixtures have been suspended as a result of financial turmoil and the local MP, James Firth, has said the club must avoid “extinction”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09207a264307bca88a140e71da3acadcc5bec12/82_277_3305_1983/master/3305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f55c39173c68e9ad9f2081c4f0d0316","title":"detention of muslims at uk ports and airports structural islamophobia","story":"Dossier by Cage attacks ‘suspicionless stops’ under anti-terror laws and highlights minuscule rate of convictionsMuslims are being detained at ports and airports for up to six hours by law enforcement using controversial counter-terrorism powers so disproportionately that the practice has become Islamophobic, according to human rights group Cage.Cage said it had made a compliant to the policing regulator, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, on behalf of 10 people, and had written to MPs on the all-party group on British Muslims to spell out the extent of its concerns with so-called schedule 7 stops.In the letter, Adnan Siddiqui, the director of Cage, said that tens of thousands of people were being subject to “suspicionless stops” and that “the practice is a manifestation of structural Islamophobia, which is experienced as harassment”.One Briton, Omer, who asked only to be identified by his first name, told the  he had been stopped 40 times when returning to the UK since 2005 but has never been convicted of any offence.A former medical professional, Omer was stopped at Heathrow returning from Lahore, Pakistan, after a flight in which he had helped a teenager having a fit. But on leaving the plane he was nevertheless questioned. “This is a law that is almost impossible to beat.”Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows people to be detained at the border for up to six hours if law enforcement is concerned they could be engaged in terrorist activities. Detainees have no right to silence, must surrender their phones, computers and passwords and provide fingerprints and DNA on request.Cage has compiled a dossier summarising its complaints about schedule 7, which is partly based on a string of case studies it has compiled. Siddiqui said that the organisation had noticed that recently “a number of Muslim women had been asked to remove their hijab at a schedule 7 stop”.In his letter to the MPs, Cage’s director added: “This request seems not to correlate with any appropriate investigation in relation to any form of terrorism, but seems to be a form of humiliation which can amount to a breach of equalities legislation.”A woman returning from Mecca was stopped and held at an airport for five hours, according to the Cage dossier, despite having felt unwell on the plane. She was separated from her husband and son, asked for fingerprints, a DNA sample, her luggage was searched and her phone taken.The woman asked what she thought about the 2017 Westminster terror attack, and wars in Syria and Yemen. “I said I didn’t agree with killing innocent people,” she recalled, before being released, having been told “you have complied with the laws”.Muslims stopped say that questions frequently focus on their religious beliefs, and they are asked if they pray frequently, if they fast and if they have been to Mecca.“The whole thing is done in such a way as to make you feel that you are doing something wrong for simply practising Islam,” said a filmmaker who had previously worked for aid organisations in Syria but on this occasion was travelling to Amsterdam via Dover.Muhammad Rabbani, Cage’s international director, said: “The discrimination faced by Muslim travellers highlights how embedded Islamophobia is in schedule 7, and in broader counter-terrorism powers. Officers routinely ask intrusive questions about religion and practice, which amounts to a modern-day inquisition.”Figures relating to the use of schedule 7 only date back to 2010, but show there have been 419,472 stops since then. In the year to March 2019, 11,151 stops were conducted, down from 85,557 in the year to March 2010.David Miranda, the partner of former  journalist Glenn Greenwald, was controversially detained at Heathrow airport under the counter-terrorism power in 2013 for carrying files relating to information obtained by US whistleblower Edward Snowden.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The use of Schedule 7 is vital to the police in their work to combat terrorism and the authors of this report are clearly misrepresenting facts to fit their own predetermined conclusions.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39d4d8d46b8e15c29411da9981b47f4b30d2217/69_117_3381_2028/master/3381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9571686bb46745cecaaa4ee2872bcfc","title":"the monster to slay before domestic policies is brexit readers on corbyns speech","story":"You have been reacting in the comments to Jeremy Corbyn’s speech on Labour’s vision to rebuild BritainYes Jeremy, I agree. You are absolutely right. The problems of the UK run far deeper than Brexit. The thing is, the country did vote for Brexit. Millions of people who will suffer the consequences of Brexit voted for it. People whose prospects are so poor that they voted for Brexit on the assumption that things can’t get any worse. But he also has to acknowledge the fact that we cannot go on to do that with the threat of Brexit hanging above our heads. It will make everything so much worse, and take away our ability to address the issues that are causing so much misery and poverty. Brexit will not lead to any short term or mid term increase in job or wealth creation. It will have the opposite effect for most ordinary people. Corbyn’s priority must be to stop any possibility of a no-deal Brexit – then to stop any form of Brexit. Even a soft Brexit with a deal will leave us worse off. He must be prepared to stand aside to allow someone else who can command a majority to become caretaker PM. It will only be a temporary position until Brexit is resolved and a general election is called. Then he can come back as Labour leader and fight that election. pocclondonAs a Labour member, its excruciating (and embarrassing) to watch Corbyn flail about like this. I’m entirely on board with our domestic policy program under Corbyn but he is never ever going to win a general election. His main appeal was the honesty and consistency which marked him out as different. Now he doesn’t even have that after pretending to campaign for Remain (i.e. disappearing) when everyone knows he loathes the EU. We’re heading for a no deal Brexit and it will be Labour’s fault. Mark ForresterSadly Corbyn is still pushing for a GE as the solution rather than a people’s vote. It looks as if he is walking straight into Johnson’s trap as the latter will be able to set the election date in his own favour. Brexit for the Tories will be more than enough to wipe out Labour. It’ll happen before the country has woken to the chaos of Brexit. Corbyn should never give Johnson what he wants – a GE, before it’s obvious to the country that his Government is sunk in Brexit chaos and exuding incompetence from every pore. FogintheChannelGreat rhetoric Corbyn. But surely the monster to tackle right now, right here, is Brexit. That is the monster to slay before domestic policies. Brexit has to be lanced first. Or can you tell us how your Brexit is going to benefit anyone? solitarybeehiveSo it seems few people understand what this position means. Labour being neutral means it will not force one position or another on their MPs who will be free to campaign and vote as they see fit. Despite what most people here seem to think, the country is still split and the only way forward is to have an open and honest conversation about it. Labour is a broad church, its voters are split over this and acting like that isn’t the case is not helpful. Taking a neutral stance allows the party to debate this on its own merits (or none) and then for everyone to vote with their own conscience. It is the only party that can and has tried to actually unite the country. KingInTheNorthPissing into the wind on Brexit again Jezza. I voted for you. I support fully the economic and social approach you and McDonnell have taken. But you have to fight the enemy in front of you. And that enemy is Brexit. You missed the point and consigned us to right wing extremist hell. Thanks. SequinnerSound strategy to remain neutral at the next referendum. The great thing is that Labour doesn’t need to come off the fence to win at the next GE and gain the remain vote. All Labour needs to do is offer a second referendum in its general election manifesto with the option to remain included in it. Anyone slightly remain inclined who is thinking rationally and wants to stop Brexit, would still vote for Labour if they offered a second referendum in it’s GE manifesto, regardless of whether Labour comes out fully in support of Remain as a party.Given all the above, and given the serious damage of a split in the Labour vote by backing remain unequivocally, it’s very hard to see how Labour will suffer from continuing on with constructive ambiguity while throwing its weight behind a second referendum vacuousCorbyn is right to note that the problems faced by the UK run much deeper than Brexit which is, after all, a symptom of those problems. Having said that, any form of Brexit that removes citizenship and rights from millions of people without their consent will compound the problems we face, not cure any of them. DJT1MillionCorbyn and the Labour leadership just don’t seem to understand that until Brexit is resolved one way or another, everything else is on the back burner. They can’t simply sit this out and hope it goes away – rightly or wrongly, it’s currently the number one issue and it needs decisive leadership to get past it. Adrianh2017Corbyn is correct - not spectacular, not catchy, not quotable, just correct. The general public are being excluded from the wealth flowing to a small fraction of the population. A step change is needed to address this. So much is wrong and so much has been deliberately broken over the last 40 years that there is no guarantee a new direction exists that will lead to prosperity for all. But unless you try nothing will change. WallyGnatSpot on Jez. Britain’s problems do lie far deeper than Brexit. The disconnected mentality of people who rail against Corbyn while not comprehending why Brexit happened is incredible. They’ll vote against Labour because red Ed ate his sandwich in a funny way and because they can’t trust the government with more taxes and then blink dumbfoundedly with an uncomprehending gaze when things continue to get worse and fall apart around them. vacuousGot to be honest, not a massive Corbyn fan, but he’s right on this one. It’s not about remain vs leave, we need to reunite the country and end the austerity that got us here in the first place. saxonwhittle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dea6b1055040f868e839b10d7cf0b276da70c6e6/0_0_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b2236431815bc22bc6108d73e0fca71","title":"practice does not always make perfect violinists 10000 hour rule","story":"Research of violinists undermines popular idea as average players practise more than best onesWith blatant disregard for the public benefits of motivational idioms, researchers have concluded that practice does not, necessarily, make perfect.A study of violinists found that merely good players practised as much as, if not more than, better players, leaving other factors such as quality of tuition, learning skills and perhaps natural talent to account for the difference.The work is the latest blow to the 10,000-hour rule, the idea promoted in Malcolm Gladwell’s 2008 book, Outliers, which has been taken to mean that enough practice will make an expert of anyone. In the book, Gladwell states that “ten thousand hours is the magic number of greatness”.“The idea has become really entrenched in our culture, but it’s an oversimplification,” said Brooke Macnamara, a psychologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. “When it comes to human skill, a complex combination of environmental factors, genetic factors and their interactions explains the performance differences across people.”The seed for the 10,000-hour rule was a 1993 study of violinists and pianists which found that accumulated practice time rose with musical prowess. On average, top-ranked violinists had clocked up 10,000 hours of practice by the age of 20, though many had actually put in fewer hours. In the study, the authors rejected an important role for natural talent and argued that differences in ability, even among top musicians, were largely down to how much they practised. Gladwell seized on the round number to explain the success of notables from Bill Gates to the Beatles.Macnamara and her colleague Megha Maitra set out to repeat part of the 1993 study to see whether they reached the same conclusions. They interviewed three groups of 13 violinists rated as best, good, or less accomplished about their practice habits, before having them complete daily diaries of their activities over a week.While the less skilful violinists clocked up an average of about 6,000 hours of practice by the age of 20, there was little to separate the good from the best musicians, with each logging an average of about 11,000 hours. In all, the number of hours spent practising accounted for about a quarter of the skills difference across the three groups, according to the study published in Royal Society Open Science.Macnamara believes practice is less of a driver. “Once you get to the highly skilled groups, practice stops accounting for the difference. Everyone has practised a lot and other factors are at play in determining who goes on to that super-elite level,” she said. “The factors depend on the skill being learned: in chess it could be intelligence or working memory, in sport it may be how efficiently a person uses oxygen. To complicate matters further, one factor can drive another. A child who enjoys playing the violin, for example, may be happy to practise and be focused on the task because they do not see it as a chore.”The authors of the 1993 study are unimpressed, however. One co-author, Anders Ericsson, a psychologist at Florida State University, said the new paper actually replicated most of their findings. He said there were no objective differences between Macnamara’s best and good violinists, so no surprise they put in the same amount of practice. “When the human body is put under exceptional strain during deliberate practice, a range of dormant genes in the DNA of any healthy inidual are expressed and extraordinary physiological processes are activated. The benefit of this type of practice is available to anyone who wants to improve their performance,” he said.Another co-author on the 1993 study, Ralf Krampe, a psychologist at the Catholic University of Leuven, said nothing in Macnamara’s paper made him question the original findings. “Do I believe that practice is everything and that the number of hours alone determine the level reached? No, I don’t,” he said, adding that the quality of practice, teachers and parental support all matter too. “But I still consider deliberate practice to be by far the most important factor.”Macnamara said it was important for people to understand the limits of practice, though. “Practice makes you better than you were yesterday, most of the time,” she said. “But it might not make you better than your neighbour. Or the other kid in your violin class.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ba2f513550337c06a3f77ed397d75c30cc5989e/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffde74b6f739c07f4dec66c20b9a33f7","title":"nurses in wales leaving job due to stress report says","story":"Inquiry finds community nurses feel unsupported and view themselves as ‘invisible service’Morale among community nurses is low and many are leaving the service due to stress and an increased workload, a report has claimed.The report from a Welsh assembly committee said the changing nature of healthcare, in particular the move to provide more help in the home and the ageing population, made the role of community nurses increasingly important.But it said many community nurses feel they do not get the support they need and some see themselves as the “invisible service”.While the assembly’s health, social care and sport committee focused on Wales, its findings will resonate across many areas of the UK.Members expressed concern that despite the importance of the service they could find no accurate national picture of the number and skill mix of community nursing teams, or the number of patients receiving care in their own homes. They concluded this was likely to have an impact on the effectiveness of the service.One of the biggest issues raised by nurses in Wales during a committee inquiry was their inability to access to technology to enable them to do their job effectively.Community nursing is a collective term for all nurses, midwives and health visitors working within a community setting. A district nurse is a nurse who has successfully completed training that has led to a specialist practitioner qualification (SPQ) being formally recorded against their Nursing \u0026amp Midwifery Council registration.Half of the community nurses who took part in the inquiry said they had no access to a mobile. They also reported that many mobiles provided by the employer had no software access to office calendar or emails. Instead, the committee found they were reliant on paper-based systems and outdated technology.Dai Lloyd, the committee chair, said: “We are proud of the work that community nurses do. They are unsung heroes in the health service. We are concerned to hear from nurses about low staff morale and in some cases nurses are leaving the service as a result of stress and increased workload.“For the service to improve and thrive we need to make sure that staffing levels are right, that nurses are provided with the mobile technology they need to do their jobs effectively and that community nursing is seen as an attractive career.”The committee made 10 recommendations to the Welsh government including doing more to understand staffing levels and making sure nurses had access to the technology they need.Members also said they were extremely concerned to hear that children were less likely to be cared for at home at the end of life than adults because of shortages in skilled community nurses.It called on the government to make sure there were enough skilled community nurses to deal with the specific needs of children with complex medical conditions.Lisa Turnbull, of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales, who gave evidence to the inquiry, said: “Morale is quite low, particularly at the senior levels, in community nursing because of the tremendous pressure they’ve been under and feel that they’ve been under for a long time, and also this feeling of being invisible to the wider service.”A report from the Queen’s Nursing Institute flagged up by the committee said enrolment levels across the UK for the district nurse qualification had been steadily falling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

Really. At that speed a batsman has around 0.4sec to play with which, most studies seem to agree, also happens to be how long it takes to blink. But that 0.4sec is only a fag-packet calculation. The true number would allow for the ball’s deceleration and its journey down into the pitch and up away from it, but still, we are dealing with the tiny margins, tenths and hundredths, that a batsman has to spot the length, the line, make up his mind, and then play a shot. So near the top of the accelerometer, cricket begins to seem almost physically impossible.At that speed strange things start to happen, for the batsman, the bowler, and the spectators. Time begins to both speed up and slow down, as though someone’s sitting on the remote. Our sense of it gets elastic. On Saturday Steve Smith, who, with his Heath Robinson batting technique, usually seems to have so much time to work in, was all of a sudden so short of it he could not even make it halfway through a shot before the ball was on him. And then when he fell, everything slowed right down again, as the crowd fell silent and minds filled with a flood of awful thoughts.The difference between the half-second before the ball hit him and the half-second afterwards could be measured in minutes.In the rush, everything became a little blurry and uncertain and frantic. Right after, everyone was wondering when, if ever, an Englishman had ever bowled quicker, and speculating about who, if anyone, had ever made a better debut. Again, then, our minds were playing games. It was only six months ago that Mark Wood was bowling 95mph against West Indies in St Lucia, when he took five for 41. And there was another fast bowler in this very same Test, Pat Cummins, who swept away South Africa with six for 79 in Johannesburg when he was an 18-year-old tearaway playing his first match in 2011.So it’s not just the batsmen who stop thinking clearly. The spectators do too. We get so worked up about what’s in front of us we cannot believe it was ever any better. There is a school of thought that bowlers are bound to be faster now, simply because of the advances in sport science, strength and conditioning. Records progress, the argument goes. Except no one has come within 20cm of Mike Powell’s long jump world record in almost 30 years and Seb Coe still holds the British 800m record set in 1981, and the time Jim Hines ran in the 1968 Olympic 100m final would have won him bronze at the world championships in 2017 in a dead heat with Usain Bolt.In baseball, the fastest recorded pitch was thrown by Aroldis Chapman, 105.1mph, in 2010 but retrospective analysis has shown Nolan Ryan was pitching nearly as quick in 1974 and Bob Feller was not so far behind in 1946. Pitchers have been throwing at 100mph for almost 100 years. There are no great leap forwards left to make.In cricket, the fastest ball is still Shoaib Akhtar’s to Nick Knight during Pakistan’s match against England in the 2003 World Cup. But Knight played it like he faced it hundreds of times before and even Shoaib admitted there is some scepticism about the measurement. You cannot really trust the speed guns, when during this same Lord’s Test one of Archer’s loopy knuckleballs got clocked at 90mph.Scientists have tried to get more precise measurements. A study done in 1976 clocked Jeff Thompson’s top speed at 99.8mph, and Michael Holding’s at 95.2mph, but then another, just three years later had Thompson at 91.8mph and Holding at 87.76mph. Back before that Frank Tyson, likely the fastest England ever had, remembered being tested at New Zealand’s Aeronautical College in Wellington in 1955. “We bowled in two or three sweaters,” Tyson said, “and I cannot vouch for the length of our run-ups.” Tyson says he was clocked at 89mph, from a strolling start.Tyson knew as much about fast bowling as anyone. “He fell into the particularly modern pattern of the sportsman who, by taking thought, has added a cubit to his athletic stature,” wrote John Arlott. “He applied an academically trained brain to sport and, beginning from the basic principles of bowling, analysed his physical assets and exploited them to maximum effect.”As a player, writer, scholar, and coach, Tyson made a lifelong study of both the art and science of fast bowling. He became an early evangelist for biomechanics. But in the end, right towards the end of his life, he still believed “the only true judge of a bowler’s speed is the batsman himself”.The truth is that, just as in baseball, there has always been a small number of men who are able to bowl right up above 95mph. It’s not a peak but a plateau and up there everything gets subjective and dependent on a wild number of variables. Not just the predictable ones, like the batsman’s ability, and their familiarity with the bowler’s action, the pitch and the atmospheric conditions, but more ephemeral things too. Perhaps the batsman has happened to catch the bowler in a bad mood maybe, like Smith did, he just made the mistake of thrashing him through cover for four. They are all fast, who is fastest depends on who you were unlucky enough to face and where and when it happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaf17a0617aa3d299cabd240aaac33c8628e56d5/0_278_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3d33fc3b4c8ac5c0a4660daf97abcfa","title":"talking horses john gosden worried enable undone tactical race yorkshire oaks horse racing tips","story":"John Gosden is concerned about a potentially tactical race after only four runners were declared for the Yorkshire Oaks on Thursday, expected to be the final race in Britain for his star mare Enable. The five-year-old is long odds-on with bookmakers to land the prize on her way to Paris in October, where she will attempt to become the first horse to win the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe for a third time.“The smaller the field, the stranger the race can often be,” said Gosden, who has provided one of Enable’s three rivals in Lah Ti Dar. The other two runners are trained by Aidan O’Brien, notably Magical, supplemented into the race last week at a cost of £30,000. Completing the field is South Sea Pearl, only eighth in a French Group Two race at the weekend.“Magical was what you might call an unusual late supplement for one of Aidan’s, who are normally in all the races from day one,” Gosden said. “And then they’ve popped in a filly that just happens to have run a mile and a half round Deauville on Sunday. She’s obviously on a travel bonus scheme.”To a suggestion that South Sea Pearl may be a pacemaker, Gosden replied: “I don’t know if she’s fast enough to do that. She didn’t look fast enough to me the other day, so I’m not quite sure what she’s doing there.”“We’ve been very happy with her indeed. And actually, funnily enough, with Lah Ti Dar. She’s run twice at York and won there both times. The Lloyd Webbers are very keen, they’ve planned it all year, so she’s running.“I’ve never been a great one for running good fillies against each other but once you get into the late summer and autumn, the options are not multiple if you want to operate at Group One level.”The presence of Enable and Magical, the two highest-rated females in Europe, proved enough to scare away the other possible runners, Sir Michael Stoute taking out Sun Maiden, while Ralph Beckett withdrew Manuela De Vega. Gosden’s Oaks winner, Anapurna, will also go elsewhere, possibly to the Vermeille next month.Gosden runs the second-favourite in Wednesday’s big race, the Juddmonte International, in King Of Comedy, last seen running on well into second over a shorter distance at Royal Ascot. “You can find easier races than this, taking on Crystal Ocean, but he’s a talented young horse and he deserves the opportunity. He was still quite immature at Ascot. He’s come on a lot since the race. I’ve been very happy with his work, I think he’s more professional now.”On Friday, the trainer runs Straarius in the Lonsdale, in which the chestnut could trigger a £1m bonus from Weatherbys Hamilton for the second year running if he wins.“I’m just sitting here looking at the field, it’s pretty hot,” Gosden said. “There’s some very smart horses. He’s got the penalty to deal with, he’s giving 3lb to the other older horses and he’s giving a bundle of weight to the likes of South Pacific, so the weights could well be really tough against him. He’s going great, he’s in good form at home.”The GosdenDettori bandwagon looks set to rumble right through York this week, starting with King Of Comedy (3.35) in the Juddmonte International. We could see significant improvement from this one, who has been tucked away for the last couple of months, while his stablemates have been sweeping up Group Ones for fun.He seemed the one to take out of the St James’s Palace Stakes, when a storming run up the straight took him into second place and he would have won with just another few yards. That was his first try above Listed level and he hung away from the whip, so there is every chance of another step forward, with his trainer reporting that he has grown up a bit.The extra quarter-mile should make quite a difference to him and of course it is no disadvantage that Dettori now returns to his saddle. He is preferred to Crystal Ocean, who was helped by the rain (and Dettori) when he won the Prince of Wales but probably meets a drier surface here and might just lack the selection’s pace.Similar concerns are held for Japan. Regal Reality is an each-way option at 33-1, if he can be forgiven his soft-ground flop here last time.1.55 York Shergar Cup form is not usually the first thing one looks for at one of the year’s biggest meetings but Final Venture ran a big race when pipped at the Ascot jamboree recently. He was beaten only a neck in this contest last year and the in-form Oisin Murphy can be relied on to make the most of his chance once more. Two years ago, he was in the Nunthorpe but he has come down to a rating he can beat when everything falls right.2.25 York Charlie Hills has won the Acomb twice in the last four years and it is interesting that he comes straight here with Persuasion, who made such a good debut when winning at Glorious Goodwood. There is some precocity in his family, so it might be rash to expect much improvement, but that effort already makes him one of the three best-rated entries here and the other two have had many more chances. He also overcame some trouble in running that day.3.00 York Constantinople has plenty of ability but he has to be viewed with some suspicion after consecutive narrow defeats. Logician has a few pounds to find to take a Great Voltigeur but he is the unexposed one and is certainly going the right way. Dettori rides him for only the second time.Bath\u0026nbsp1.45 Red Tycoon 2.15 Tommy Rock 2.50 Gallatin 3.25 Line Of Reason 4.05\u0026nbspTavus (nb) 4.40 Cuttin\u0027 Edge 5.15 La FortunaYork\u0026nbsp1.55 Final Venture 2.25 Persuasion 3.00 Logician 3.35 King Of Comedy (nap)\u0026nbsp4.15 Blue Laureate 4.50 BuhturiCarlisle\u0026nbsp2.05 Leapers Wood 2.35 Ainsdale 3.10 Ugo Gregory 3.45 Manshood 4.25\u0026nbspBeechwood Jude 4.55 Firewater 5.25 My Ukelele 5.55 Lucky IconWorcester\u0026nbsp5.00 Skinflint 5.30 Attest 6.00 Full Bore 6.30 West Coast Flyer 7.00 North\u0026nbspStar Oscar 7.30 Pogo I Am 8.00 CottonvaleKempton\u0026nbsp5.45 Restless Endeavour 6.15 Mojave 6.45 To The Moon 7.15 Alfurat River\u0026nbsp7.45 Highland Sky 8.15 Travel On 8.45 Indian Viceroy\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e86e0a4dc4097a0ef6163fcb7e73d081e0c73d/0_314_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d4a52c2e1ef30e01ee78b8db512c283","title":"crystal rasmussen review underbelly cowgate edinburgh festival 2019","story":"Underbelly Cowgate, EdinburghA Romanov raised by wolves meets a struggling Lancashire boy in a memoir dipped in glamour and pulsating to powerpopThere’s a well-travelled road from boy- or girlband glory to solo success. So why shouldn’t it be open to alumni of the drag queen quintet Denim? Crystal Rasmussen sings in that supergroup and now turns their memoir Diary of a Drag Queen into a fringe show. It charts the life stories of Crystal – a Romanov who fled the Bolsheviks to be raised by wolves – and their alter ego Tom, a gender nonconforming boy in Lancashire, struggling to live a life without shame. They meet they help one another they become one – with costume changes and powerpop cover versions en route.The twin-track narrative is a nice conceit, and it’s thrilling when they come together – by which stage, Crystal is married to seventh husband Mr Blobby and Tom is listening to Madonna on the school bus while being pelted with oranges. (The homophobia they experience gets worse, and is shocking.) Then the distinction between the two personae blurs, as Rasmussen reads from chapters of his memoir representing their various stations of their cross. Kate Bush, Madge herself and Minnie Riperton – if not quite with her signature top note – help the story along its way.Finally, it tells a conventional story of an unconventional life, as Rasmussen’s “techniques to conquer shame and violence” are revealed to be self-acceptance and “valuing all the parts of myself”. (This is the kind of show where the performer is cheered for putting on a string of pearls.) The glamorous aspirations sometimes chafe against the lo-fi staging, and Rasmussen writhing semi-nude in a paddling pool brings little to the party.

It’s bigger, heavier, thicker and has more cameras and sensors on the back and front than the S10+.The front is filled by the 6.7in QHD+ AMOLED screen, which curves at the sides and has an large oval-shaped cut out in the top right of the display for two selfie cameras and a depth sensor.The screen is really lovely, as you’d expect for a top Samsung: bright, crisp and colourful with good viewing angles. It is not quite as bright or smooth as the fantastic 90Hz screen on the OnePlus 7 Pro, but better than all the rest.The massive screen means the S10 5G is a very big phone. At 77.1mm wide and 162.6mm tall the S10 5G compares similarly to 5G rivals such the OnePlus 7 Pro or the 4G-only iPhone XS Max. But the way the back tapers at the sides and its comparatively light 198g weight, which undercuts the competition by 8-10g, makes the S10 5G just about manageable. I could fit it in a men’s jeans pocket, but anything smaller was a struggle.If you don’t want the biggest of phones and the downsides of weight, cost, size, one-handed use, etc that come with them, this is most definitely not for you.The display hides Samsung’s ultrasonic fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone with your thumb on the screen, which works well enough but isn’t as fast or accurate as the optical sensor on the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G or traditional fingerprint sensors.The phone is water resistant to the international IP68 standard, or depths of up to 1.5 metres in fresh water for 30 minutes. Drop the S10 5G in the toilet and you’ll be able to rinse it afterwards. It also has a headphone socket, which is rare in 2019.The Galaxy S10 5G has the same processor, memory and storage as most of the other Galaxy S10 versions and therefore performs similarly. In this US this means Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor, but in the UK, Europe and many other regions it means Samsung’s own Exynos 9820, as tested here.It’s a fast-feeling phone, if not quite the fastest, and will handle most of what you can throw at it. Games and augmented reality experiences, which are being pushed hard with 5G, were smooth but made the phone heat up quite a bit.The S10 5G has the largest battery in Samsung’s S10 phone line and so lasts the longest at 36 hours between charges. With the screen set to default FHD+ resolution and the always-on display (AOD) setting off, the phone made it from 7am on day one until 7pm on day two with fairly heavy usage, mainly on 4G with bursts on Vodafone’s new 5G network where available in London.The S10 5G proved great on Vodafone’s new 5G network, which was significantly faster than 4G when available, routinely managing 200Mbps download speeds in areas where Vodafone’s 4G network managed around 20-50Mbps.But the S10 5G’s 4G performance on Vodafone’s network was poor, spending a significant amount of time dropping down to 3G in areas where a OnePlus 7 Pro and Huawei P30 Pro had strong 4G signal on the same Vodafone 4G network. The issue was particularly problematic on public transport.This poor performance gave rise to further testing which revealed that the poor signal performance on Vodafone’s 4G network wasn’t isolated to Samsung’s new 5G phone – but also its regular 4G phones including the Galaxy S10. The 4G-only phones had a slight advantage of around half a bar of signal strength over their 5G counterparts on the same network.However, when the Samsung phones dropped down to 3G their internet connection effectively became unusable causing everything from web pages and apps, to messages and even email, to time out. But it’s worse than simply being offline, as the phone thinks it has a working internet connection, leading to an extremely frustrating scenario where the phone continually tries over and over to perform the task you’ve set it before timing out after a minute or so.To be clear, Samsung’s S10, S10+ and S10e performed the same as the OnePlus 7 Pro and Huawei P30 Pro (two of the best for network performance) on both EE and Three’s 4G network in and around London and the south of England. The problem appeared only to be on Vodafone. But neither Vodafone nor Samsung could explain the signal issues faced by the Samsung S10 5G and other S10 smartphones.A Vodafone spokesperson said: “We’ve recalled the device and SIM for internal testing. We would welcome the opportunity to walk around with the  in the areas they have visited to better understand the user experience found so as we can better understand any issues and implement improvements or fixes.”A Samsung spokesperson declined to address the 4G problem and instead said: “The 5G user experience is only going to get better as 5G network coverage improves and expands. Samsung is working closely with our partners to provide updates to the device so that consumers can get the best network performance.”The Galaxy S10 5G runs Samsung’s new One UI version of Android 9 Pie, which is the same as the other S10 variants.One UI is a big upgrade over previous versions of Samsung’s software, refocused around making phones with large screens more usable, which was useful here. The top of the screen is generally for information display, while the bits you have to touch have been moved towards the bottom.The only thing that hasn’t aged well are Samsung’s gesture navigation options, which replace the traditional three-key navigation bar at the bottom of the screen with swipe pads where the buttons would be. It’s not a fluid experience and is difficult to use one-handed on this size of screen.While more beneficial for the larger Galaxy S10+, the S10 still benefits from generally having the top half of the phone for viewing information and the bottom half for touch-based interactions. Rival systems such as that used by OnePlus, Huawei or even Google’s upcoming Android Q are far better.The Galaxy S10 5G has the same three regular cameras on the back as the S10 and S10+ but adds a 3D depth camera for good measure.That means you get a main 12-megapixel camera, 12-megapixel telephoto camera and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera providing zoom from 0.5 to 2x, and then on to a 10x hybrid zoom.There didn’t appear to be much difference between the cameras on the S10 5G and S10S10+. It produced some excellent photos in good light, with solid but not class-leading low-light performance, despite the new night mode.Video capture was very good, arguably better than many rivals, with fun depth effects using the extra sensors on the S10 5G. The selfie camera is the same as the S10+, which is excellent.Overall, the camera on the S10 5G is good, but falls short of the best from Huawei.The Galaxy S10 5G has all the hallmarks of a range-topping Samsung. A big, bright screen, sleek design, solid performance and excellent battery life - the best of any of Samsung’s S10 variants.The rear camera is also very good and Samsung’s One UI is great, as long as you’re happy using navigation buttons as the swipe gestures are hard to use on this size of phone. It is massive and expensive, meaning only big-phone lovers are going to want to even try and use it.Its 5G performance is solid on Vodafone’s new 5G network. But the poor 4G performance on Vodafone of the S10 5G and its smaller S10 siblings, which neither the network nor Samsung have managed to explain, mean I strongly recommend not buying any top-end Samsung phone on Vodafone.It may not quite be the best 5G experience available at the moment – that’s the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G – but it’s close run thing. And where the OnePlus is an EE exclusive in the UK, the S10 5G is available on a wider range of mobile networks.The S10 5G is the biggest and best Samsung you can buy, at least until the recently launched Note 10 arrives in stores, which could take the crown.Pros: great screen, ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner, hole-punch notch, wireless charging and powershare, great camera, good performance, good software, good haptics, headphone socket, microSD card slot, 5G.Cons: massive phone, expensive, poor 4G performance on Vodafone, slow software updates.

While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

So why are so many of us streaming endless reruns of 90s sitcoms?In the opening episode of Netflix’s animated Hollywood satire BoJack Horseman, the eponymous steed gives a drunken speech about Horsin’ Around, the (fictional) feelgood sitcom that made him a star in the 90s. “For a lot of people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra,” he says. “And sometimes, when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other – where no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes, everything’s gonna turn out OK.”BoJack Horseman is a rare thing on Netflix in that it is a) original, b) critically adored and c) extremely popular. It is the 15th-most-viewed Netflix show in the US, according to the analytics firm Jumpshot (one of the best guides to what is popular on the platform, as Netflix doesn’t release stats).But cast your eyes up that list and there are far more Horsin’ Arounds than there are BoJack Horsemans. The most popular show is the US version of The Office, which ran for nine series on the US channel NBC in the 00s. Friends, the archetypal feelgood 90s sitcom (iffy sexual politics notwithstanding), is the second-most-streamed show on the platform – this week, a former employee of Robert De Niro’s production company was alleged in its court claim to have watched 55 episodes of it in one four-day period. No wonder Netflix is believed to have paid WarnerMedia $100m ($85m) to license the show for 2019.Gilmore Girls, Parks and Recreation, Arrested Development and Frasier also appear high on the list, more prominent than heralded Netflix Originals, such as Stranger Things, House of Cards or The Crown (reportedly the most expensive TV show ever made).It seems that, in this time of unprecedented choice and quality, the so-called golden age of prestige television, most of us still want to watch half-hour shows about vaguely likable people in which everything turns out OK. Ideally from the 90s, but maybe the 00s. And preferably something that we have seen many, many times before. Welcome to the age of non-event TV.“Over the past month or so, I have been watching as much Modern Family as possible,” says Ciaran, 29, who works as a policy analyst in London. “I’ve seen them all loads of times, but I just don’t feel like watching anything else because I love the warmth and comfort that comes from the show. I think I started watching it again when I was going through a particularly bad time at work. I got addicted to the warmth, and then I got addicted to just feeling good about myself.”Lucy, 28, from London, feels the same about Gilmore Girls. The kooky comedy-drama never drew sky-high ratings when it aired on US cable TV between 2000 and 2007, but it has become a huge hit in the streaming era. (Netflix did deign to reveal a couple of years ago that it was its “most binge-raced” show – consumed in its entirety within 24 hours of appearing on the service.) “I rewatch it when I’m stressed as low-level distraction, but also to return to reassuring worlds with low jeopardy and known outcomes,” says Lucy.Sometimes, she has it on in the background while she does housework or lets Netflix autoplay her to sleep. Lucy says she still likes to watch the prestige shows that everyone is talking about – but they’re a bit like haute cuisine to Gilmore Girls’ pasta. “I find it more relaxing to rewatch, as I don’t have to join in on the hot takes and social threads that surround the ‘big new series’ or worry about spoilers,” she says. “I can create a little bubble and totally tune out.”It has often been observed that the emergence of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Now TV, Hulu, Facebook TV and the rest has opened up frontiers for TV – makers don’t have to worry so much about averting flagging ratings when viewers start losing interest. Now that we can consume series at our own pace, our tolerance for convoluted narrative arcs, enormous casts and season-long digressions has increased hugely. There’s lots of Silicon Valley cash to bankroll the programmes, too. But while dinner party chat still centres on Russian Doll and Big Little Lies, platforms are increasingly thinking about the other stuff: the chewing-gum TV, the long-tail TV, the shows that vaguely brighten up the room. That could be a random episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air that turns into a weekend-long binge, or it may be mid-00s cookery flotsam, middlebrow property porn or makeover TV detritus.Matthew Ball, a US venture capitalist and sharp commentator on the streaming platforms, calls it “tonnage”. For him, the idea that it is “quality” driving the shift to streaming is a misconception. “Netflix’s biggest shows drove subscriber growth and branding, but most of its success comes from enabling audiences to easily watch large volumes of all types of content wherever they are, without fail, and at a low cost,” he says. “Netflix isn’t ‘hired’ for Stranger Things, but for entertainment at large.”Tonnage is increasingly where the platforms are focusing their algorithms and cash as the attention wars escalate. Netflix is likely to lose Friends and the US version of The Office – a combined 400-plus episodes of non-event TV – as WarnerMedia and NBC, their owners, launch their own streaming platforms at some point in the next couple of years. Apple is due to launch a streaming service in the autumn, and has lobbed a reported $6bn at new programmes (including a drama starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston as warring TV hosts). But, although audiences come for the shiny new stuff, they stay for the old reliables such as Seinfeld, over which there is a bidding war. Disney+ is launching in the autumn – and because Disney owns the Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel franchises, that is a lot of “tonnage”.Ball reckons Netflix would have achieved similar levels of success with or without Friends – but he stresses that Netflix is popular for precisely the same reasons that Friends is popular. It’s just easy to watch. “Netflix’s delivery innovations have made it so easy to discover and watch content that whole generations, who would never have watched Friends or Golden Girls via occasional reruns on random TV networks, are devouring them.” There is something novel about watching a season of Friends in sequential order, as opposed to a mishmash of repeats and missed episodes. A semi-forgotten series such as Frasier, meanwhile, can find new life in the streaming era as a meme trove.All this presents an additional challenge to the traditional channels, as the new Ofcom statistics reveal. The average British person watches nearly five hours of video a day, on TVs, laptops, phones and the rest. Live TV remains dominant – on average, we watch two hours and 43 minutes a day – but other means are catching up, including recorded playback (30 minutes), streaming services (26 minutes) and YouTube not on a TV (34 minutes).We may no longer be content to settle for random reruns on regular channels, but according to the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (Barb) – which has collated viewing-hours data since 1992 – it’s not vastly more than we used to watch. Twenty-five years ago, we were still watching close to four hours of broadcast TV each a day, and that wasn’t counting satellite and cable – nor hours spent watching old VHS tapes.The high numbers make more sense when you consider how people actually use their TVs. In the 90s, my family TV set would usually be switched on from between 4pm and 11pm every day, and I don’t think we were unusual. My little sister watched cartoons after school, and my older sister and I would then commandeer the remote for Home and Away and Neighbours. The early evening news would play to an empty room while we ate dinner, then the whole family would gather for Top of the Pops or EastEnders. A lot of the time, the TV would be on in the background while housework or homework was done, a bit like how I have the radio on most of the time in my kitchen now. Or how many teenagers let YouTubers autoplay in their bedrooms.Seetal, 38, from north London, lists Friends, The Big Bang Theory, Brooklyn 99 and Two and a Half Men, as well as Nigel Slater’s and Rick Stein’s cookery programmes as being among her favourite non-event TV shows. “They’re familiar, and that’s a source of comfort in itself. There’s a heavy dose of nostalgia. And you know what’s going to happen.” Sometimes, we watch TV because we want to be gripped and amazed, but mostly because we want to be soothed and cheered. Personally, I’m a little dystopia’d out at the moment, and slightly weary of portentous prestige dramas that only really get going in the third series I’m always more keen to be recommended a 25-minute sitcom that I won’t find annoying than I am some nasty bit of true crime.Helen Sneha Jambunathan, a behavioural analyst for the market research company Canvas8, sees such choices as an inevitable – when many of us face increasing levels of stress and anxiety, “the lure of vegging out is undeniable”, she says. “Easy-to-consume media let people switch off in a way that’s simply not possible when fully focused or even just daydreaming. It provides the same effect as carrying out manual work or exercising – your consciousness has something to focus on, while the rest of you truly gets to rest.” You could call it mindful mindlessness.But with a few exceptions, such as the cheerfully uncomplicated Brooklyn 99, they don’t really make sitcoms like Friends or Horsin’ Around any more. Jambunathan reckons the popularity of 90s and 00s shows in particular speaks to endemic loneliness among younger generations – a yearning for a more innocent time. “We often think of elderly people relying on TV for companionship, but younger people do it, too,” she says. “A lot of the less prestigious TV shows contain familiar characters in stories that we can easily pop in and out of, just as we would with friends and family in the real world.”For Emma, 34, a freelance events designer from Margate, the absence of unexpected twists is what draws her back to her favourites: The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Frasier and Parks and Recreation. “There’s nothing that’s going to give you deep thought there. Something like Line of Duty or Killing Eve is not like that.” But her most compulsive viewing is The Big Bang Theory, to which she has fallen asleep every night for the past five years.“I’m one of those weird people who has to have noise on when I work. I always have at least the radio and the TV on at the same time. I feel like my brain has adapted to all these extra stimuli – if there’s silence, I can’t switch off, so it’s a way of keeping my brain occupied. So when I go to sleep I have to watch The Big Bang Theory on repeat or I just lie awake thinking about stuff.”Emma knows how bad all that blue light is for your concentration, and how it is important to give your brain a break from information. She wishes she could listen to some classical music, or even have silence instead. “But I now just can’t sleep without it.” She estimates that she has seen every episode about 20 times. Considering there are 279 episodes, that is a lot of Big Bang Theory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e75332ed4a3bdd62f16eb8ec3fa8c99dc9b83a1/31_52_3829_2298/master/3829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a620ac08eed896cd148c716b700e67a9","title":"tv tonight bbc four bauhaus 100","story":"The radical German art movement is honoured with a comprehensive documentary, followed by an experiment with six art graduates.

The design stood out even more when that was done, so school personnel proceeded to color his entire scalp with black marker.“They laughed as they took many minutes to color 13-year-old J.T.’s scalp which took many days of scrubbing to come off. J.T. was immensely humiliated and shamed,” the lawsuit states.“There are hardly any African Americans in America with jet black skin,” the court document reads.As news of the incident spread and outrage grew, the Pearland ISD issued a statement saying that it was “extremely disappointed to learn of a situation”, but it insisted that the boy’s haircut violated district dress code.Nevertheless, a “campus administrator mishandled disciplinary action”, and the practice is “not condoned by the district”, it said. The unnamed administrator was placed on administrative leave over the incident.The statement said that ISD officials contacted the student’s family “to express our sincerest apology and extreme disappointment in this situation”.However, according to the lawsuit and the school website, the assistant principal involved in the incident has since been promoted to school principal.In a related incident south-east of Pearland, in Galveston, Texas, two white police officers on horseback were recently photographed in early August leading a handcuffed African American by a rope – a scene that evoked past lynchings of black people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8375178ec421e053a92a444c9afb1a5b053b83f8/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2de15582630c972f38d6d40d429c834","title":"the vindicator ohio newspaper shut down","story":"The Vindicator’s closure means Youngstown will be the largest US city without a major paper, and is the latest blow to an ailing American news industryIt was in the late 1920s that the Ku Klux Klan regularly began gathering outside the home of William F Maag Jr in Youngstown. Maag owned the Vindicator newspaper, which unlike others in this once prosperous part of Ohio, had been willing to criticize the racist Klansmen.Men on horseback, clad in white robes and hoods, would burn crosses and flaunt rifles and shotguns, in an attempt at intimidation. It didn’t work. The men of the Maag family would stand outside their home, themselves armed, refusing to be cowed, as the Vindicator continued to expose government officials who were part of the Klan.That defiance set the tone for decades of investigative, combative reporting from the Vindicator. The daily newspaper relentlessly reported on the mafia, the government, big business and even its own advertisers.But no more. Soon after celebrating 150 years since its first edition came news that was devastating to many in Youngstown and the wider Mahoning valley. The Vindicator was shutting down at the end of August. For good.It’s a sad end to a newspaper with a long history of fighting injustice – going all the way back to those days battling the KKK. That fearlessness is what Mark Brown, Maag’s grandson and the fourth-generation owner of the Vindicator, is most proud of.“Fighting the Klan I think would have to be number one because that was a core social justice issue,” Brown said. “The Klan tried to make this area sort of its northern center. There was a lot of support here for the Klan and we fought hard against it, and I think we succeeded for the most part.”The demise of the Vindicator is especially galling given the multi-award-winning newspaper had marked its 150th anniversary with a look back to the first edition. That first copy, a print of which hangs on the wall at the newspaper’s Youngstown office, was four pages long. It carried a story about a boy who had his teeth kicked out by a horse, an article on a farmer who had two sons: one “an early riser” and the other “an incorrigible sluggard”, and a report on the water depth of the Mahoning River.Now its closure heaps a little more pain onto an already struggling Rust Belt community. The population of Youngstown has halved since 1970, when the city’s steel industry went into a dramatic decline, and in 2007 it had the lowest median income of any US city with more than 65,000 residents.After the steel mills closed, and other businesses departed, tens of thousand of people left Youngstown to find work elsewhere. Some, however, remained, and today there are many older people in Youngstown and elsewhere in the Mahoning valley who have been left behind.“And I’ve had so many of them call me and use this exact line – they say: ‘The Vindicator is my only friend.’“I’ve heard that over, and over, and over again, and it haunts me.”The paper’s staff, some of whom have spent the best part of their lives at the Vindicator, have also been hit hard.“My identity is the Vindicator. Without the newspaper I have no identity in the community,” said Bertram de Souza, the paper’s editorial page editor and columnist.De Souza, 69, has worked at the Vindicator for more than 40 years, and was the paper’s first non-white politics writer. He moved to the US from Uganda when he was 19 years old, after then president Idi Amin expelled Asian people from the country, and eventually moved to Youngstown for the job.“I’m going to leave town. Without the Vindicator I don’t have a compelling reason to live in Youngstown,” De Souza said. “For me to keep living in Youngstown, not being associated with the newspaper makes no sense. I could live anywhere in the world,” De Souza said.The Vindicator became known for tackling the mafia and corrupt officials. The work of De Souza and other reporters in the late 1980s contributed to almost 70 elected officials, mafia members and businesspeople being convicted of criminal acts.Despite the quality of the coverage, sales have declined over the past four decades. From selling 100,000 copies in the late 1970s – 160,000 on Sundays – the Vindicator is now down to 25,000 editions daily, and 32,000 on Sunday. The paper has lost money for 20 of the last 22 years, Brown said, with a family fund covering the losses. Brown hoped to ultimately sell the Vindicator, but no buyers were forthcoming. He explored a paywall, but the numbers didn’t work. Neither did making the Vindicator online-only.“The demise of newspapers, I think, is scary for any democracy. Because I think newspapers have been totally under appreciated for what they have done to keep the government in check. To prevent corruption, to keep people honest,” Brown said.“That’s what scares me the most, is I’m not sure who provides that check. And you have to have it. History has shown you have to have that balance if you want to maintain a democracy. And we’re about to lose it.”The Vindicator has been in Brown’s family for 132 years, with Betty Brown Jagnow, Brown’s mother, spending the past 38 years as publisher. Brown Jaglow, 89, has worked at the paper for a total of 71 years, and the closure is difficult to take.“I could cry. It’s been my life, and I’ve never regretted it,” Brown Jagnow said. “It’s been a wonderful experience.”Brown Jagnow started at the paper on April Fool’s Day, 1948, aged 18. In spite of her advancing years, Brown Jagnow still comes into the office three times a week, working alongside her son and the team. It’s been a remarkable tenure, particularly as she hadn’t initially wanted to work at the Vindicator – only attending an interview after her priest recommended a job there.“It was the best thing that ever happened to me,” Brown Jagnow said.As for the final editions of the Vindicator, Sweetwood said the team are planning a “good old-fashioned Viking funeral”. The last week will feature exclusive stories each day, he said, alongside articles charting the paper’s past.Then, after 150 years, the final ever copy of the Vindicator will hit the stands on Sunday 31 August. The last edition will bring the curtain down on an illustrious history, and leave Youngstown without its venerable, trusted news source."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9efa6f95407b8fcaea76d20a4ef9d7ef00e5cebc/1_0_2499_1500/master/2499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e0edff24a02d1d04172ae39ccb7a288","title":"asylum seekers crammed into cockroach infested accommodation home office","story":"‘Guest houses’ provided by Home Office contractor unfit for habitation, say lawyersHundreds of asylum seekers have been crammed into a network of “guest houses” provided by a Home Office contractor that are overrun by cockroaches, rats and mice, the  has learned.Lawyers shown footage recorded by the  – which reveals that families of four are sharing small double beds and are being crammed into spaces so small that they are barely able to walk around their rooms – said that the conditions could constitute statutory overcrowding and an environment unfit for human habitation.One lawyer branded the conditions “depraved” and accused the home secretary, Priti Patel, of being “slum landlord in chief”.The buildings of the Maharaja Guest House in Southall, west London, are infested with tens of thousands of cockroaches, which feed on the residents’ food. In one of the kitchens seen by the , more than 100 cockroaches scattered when just one cupboard was opened.The managers, Mylondonlets, advertise rooms priced from £40 per night. The company is paid by the Home Office’s accommodation contractor for Wales and the south of England, Clearsprings Ready Homes, to house asylum seekers. The MyLondonLets website says it is “working in partnership” with a number of councils including Ealing, where the properties seen by the  are located.The website appeals for new properties and states: “HMOs (houses in multiple occupation) are far more profitable to run than other types of residential lettings with rental incomes often two to three times those of single households.”But that profitability appears to come at a cost. Residents of the four buildings that constitute the Maharaja Guest House interviewed by the  say that rats gnaw through the plastic of bottles of cooking oil to drink the oil, while mothers reported infestations of mice and say that large rats run up their children’s legs and walk across their faces while they sleep.It is understood that there have been recurring issues with the property. The buildings were inspected earlier this year by UK visas and immigration (UKVI) and infestations were found. It was claimed that they had been cleared but UKVI has now scheduled new inspections.One mother of two said: “We are just breathing here, we are not living. The beds are not just where we sleep but our living room, our dining area, our laundry drying area and the study area for our children. The springs on the mattresses are oozing and they are full of bugs. The bed has become our whole world.”She said that the accommodation providers expected her two children, a girl and a boy, aged eight and nine, to share a bed.“I think the Home Office encourages this type of thing,” she said. “It’s all part of the hostile environment. It’s as if they’re sending a message to us saying: ‘if you can’t take it here go home’.”The rooms seen by the  are so overcrowded that typically an entire family’s living space is all but taken up by a double bed that they share. There is just one washing machine for hundreds of asylum seekers. A notice in the kitchen threatens anyone who leaves unwashed dishes in the sink with eviction. In some parts of the building up to 10 residents are expected to share one small bathroom.Outside the property, piles of rubbish constituting a fire risk are stacked up behind a gate.Conditions at the Maharaja Guest House have come to light at a time when the Home Office is implementing new accommodation contracts following criticism of previous arrangements. In its investigation into Home Office accommodation published in January 2017 the home affairs select committee found that the contracts were not working after finding many problems with vermin, unclean surroundings and inadequate support for vulnerable people. It branded some of the accommodation a disgrace and said it was shameful to place vulnerable people there.The Home Office is legally obliged to provide accommodation for destitute asylum seekers – most fall into this category. The department has just published a booklet for asylum seekers outlining what they can expect in their accommodation. According to the booklet “promoting your wellbeing” is a key priority.Asylum seekers are told they can expect a table, one dining chair, one armchair or sofa seat per person and reasonable access to laundry facilities. Those amenities did not appear to be generally available to residents in the accommodation seen by the . Asylum seekers use suitcases as wardrobes in the absence of sufficient storage space and to protect their belongings from cockroaches.Toufique Hossain of Duncan Lewis Solicitors said: “These conditions are depraved. The secretary of state is the slum landlord-in-chief. We are talking about deeply traumatised people. They have seen and experienced horrors that they will never shake. And here they are, in the United Kingdom, made to sleep with cockroaches.

While he said that it was typically difficult to enforce housing standards for asylum seekers, he added: “The conditions described are likely to breach environmental health legislation as well as statutory rules on overcrowding.”A second woman who has a baby and a seven-year-old is living in a small room. “We have had to go without heating or hot water for months at a time,” she said.A third woman said that she and her two daughters aged four and seven were all forced to share a small double bed in a room so small they can only manoeuvre themselves around the bed sideways. It is impossible for the girls to play in the room so they have to play in the dirty corridor or on a filthy staircase.Alice Lucas, Advocacy and Policy Manager for Refugee Rights Europe, which has carried out research on poor standards in Home Office accommodation, said the findings were “shocking”. “Worryingly, this does not appear to be an isolated incident,” she added. “It is high time that the UK government take urgent steps to improve conditions.”A Home Office spokesperson said the department took the wellbeing of asylum seekers “extremely seriously”.“We demand the highest standards from our contractors and their accommodation,” they said. “Where there is any suggestion they are not meeting the terms of their contract we will take immediate action.”Ealing council, Clearsprings Ready Homes and MyLondonLets did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/110557f6124f17d63355223471567705e3dc62ae/0_91_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22df20acda2ee3da97669797545f99ca","title":"fashion g7 summit sustainability kering inditex macron","story":"Growth in environmental concern pushes retailers to speed up attempts at sustainabilityThere have been few fashion statements over the years at G7 summits (dress code: world leader suit, sensible shoes).But this year, G7 leaders will be joined by more than 20 fashion retailers and brands, including the owner of Gucci, Kering, H\u0026ampM and Zara’s parent company, Inditex, for a key fashion moment – a global pact to fight the climate crisis and protect bioersity and the oceans.The deal to be concluded in Biarritz at the weekend comes as the global fashion industry faces an unprecedented backlash from young people concerned that it is contributing more to climate change than the aeronautical and shipping industries combined. Without action, the industry could account for a quarter of the world’s carbon budget by 2050.The issue is soaring up the agenda, with models on the catwalk at London fashion week next month set on a collision course with campaigners from Extinction Rebellion who want the event scrapped in the face of the climate emergency.The surge in environmental concern is forcing brands to accelerate sustainability plans and club together to bring about change not only in stores but with the factories and suppliers they share around the world.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe UK parliament’s environmental audit committee investigation into sustainable fashion has also prompted action, despite the government rejecting a recommendation of a 1p per garment tax to fund better textile recycling schemes.The committee’s report published in February named and shamed brands such as Boohoo, JD Sports, Sports Direct and TK Maxx, which had been slow to take action: failing to use sustainable cotton, collect used clothing or sign up to the government-backed sustainable clothing action plan (Scap).With the spotlight shining on the fashion industry, Primark, one of the flag-bearers for the kind of one-use fast fashion so heavily criticised by environmental activists, is experimenting with clothing recycling bins at its new store in Birmingham and has pledged to introduce a full scheme this year. It has also launched sustainable cotton jeans and eco-friendly glitter.Giorgina Waltier, sustainability manager for H\u0026ampM in the UK and Ireland, said: “There has definitely been a significant change in people’s attitudes towards sustainability and fashion in the last 12 to 18 months, with a real sense of urgency around these issues and a definite demand from consumers for more action and greater transparency from brands.”Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer at Kering (whose boss François-Henri Pinault, was asked by French president, Emmanuel Macron to help pull together the G7 fashion-industry deal) said the international fashion pact would enable global retailers to share best practice and ideas and combine their buying power to push for change right back to the agricultural practices involved in supplying raw materials.“Many companies have taken the initiative but if they do things on their own it has less impact on the ground than if they work together,” said Daveu. She said the group could combine efforts to find solutions to problems such as effective recycling of textiles and fibres for garments that can’t be worn again.“More and more customers and clients, generation Z and millennials, are expecting brands to act,” she said. “Listed companies also find more and more investors and financial analysts are taking factors like climate change into account on risk management. Chief executives and designers are also citizens of the world and very conscious that they have an important role to play in one of the most important issues of our century.”“It’s not an option, it’s now a duty of running a global company.”But there are fears that the G7 pact will only add complexity and confusion: there are already many groups involved in sustainability, including the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Global Fashion Agenda and Common Objective, a private enterprise that recently took over the former Ethical Fashion Forum, which was run as a charity.Several retail and sustainable fashion experts told the  they were concerned that the array of standards and global groups which brands and their suppliers were now expected to sign up to could ert resources from actual action.“It’s great what Macron is doing,” said one big retailer who has held back from signing up to the G7 pact, referring to the fact that it was the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who asked Kering’s boss, François-Henri Pinault, to help pull together the G7 fashion industry deal. “But our responsibility is not to just sign something and the job is done. It is fine to say stuff but actually doing stuff is what’s important. Resources can be consumed by meetings. Let’s keep the balance on delivering.”The UK government has backed an extension to Scap when it winds up next year and the new deal is expected to involve more retailers and to take steps towards developing industry-wide systems to recycle and reuse textiles and fibres.Most big retailers now agree they have to adapt to survive. Waltier said: “Our planet doesn’t have the resources available to facilitate the linear production model that the vast majority of the fashion industry operates and therefore systemic change is the only option.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Some Trump officials reportedly considered that a positive sign suggesting Maduro’s circle was “gradually cracking”.The Associated Press claimed Cabello had met someone “in close contact with the Trump administration” in Caracas last month and that a second meeting was envisioned. The US reportedly hoped engaging with Cabello would intensify an internal “knife fight” supposedly raging at the pinnacle of Maduro’s administration.Observers of Venezuelan politics greeted those reports – apparently designed to destablise Maduro’s crisis-stricken administration by stoking paranoia within his inner-circle - with scepticism.Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “I think what the US is trying to do is some sort of psy ops thing, trying to rattle people within Maduro’s administration.”But on Tuesday Maduro confirmed contact with the US, which he painted as proof that he had been seeking ways “for president Donald Trump to truly listen to Venezuela and the truth of the 21st century Bolivarian revolution”.Earlier in the day Trump told reporters: “We’re talking to various representatives of Venezuela. I don’t want to say who, but we are talking at a very high level.”Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, described reports there had been talks between Cabello and Trump officials as “a very positive sign”.Maduro has been fighting for his political life since January when a young opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, declared himself Venezuela’s rightful president and received the backing of more than 50 governments, including the US and UK.More than four million Venezuelans have now fled their oil-rich but economically devastated nation, according to the UN’s refugee agency, with at least 1 million people leaving since last November alone."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3992232.1566325093!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more than 1 000 women to get reviews of smear tests soon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn aggregate report summarising the findings of the review of 1,051 women’s test history will be provided to the Minister for Health, Simon Harris. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The More than 1,000 women are to receive the results of a British review of their smear tests under the cervical cancer screening programme in the coming weeks, according to the Health Service Executive.Each of the women will be provided with a personalised assessment of their smear history compiled by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), as part of the independent review established last year.Where RCOG finds a significant discrepancy between its review of a woman’s smears and her original test results, the woman may be entitled to make a claim under the tribunal being established by the Government in response to last year’s CervicalCheck controversy. She will also be entitled to access a package of State supports, including a medical card and counselling.An aggregate report summarising the findings of the review of 1,051 women’s test history will be provided to the Minister for Health. This will show what proportion of cases agree with the CervicalCheck result, and “in what percentage there is a disagreement that may have been responsible for failing to prevent cancer”, according to RCOG.The review, which takes in both the 221 group of women at the centre of last year’s controversy over CervicalCheck, and a separate cohort of women whose cancers were notified to the National Cancer Registry, was commissioned in May 2018 with the aim of providing a comprehensive overview of the screening history of all women diagnosed with cervical cancer over the past decade.However, there were delays in setting it up and it is unlikely to be able to provide the desired comprehensive overview due to a consent rate of 63 per cent among the women who were contacted.According to the HSE, it is providing logistical support to the RCOG team, including validation of data from multiple sources, an “extensive” consent process and overseeing the complexities of retrieving the cytology slides, which were transferred to a review laboratory in the UK.Inidual reportsAnalysis of the 1,739 slides, which began in February, is now complete. RCOG’s expert review panel expects to finish writing more than 1,000 inidual reports for women by the end of August, after which the HSE will begin communicating the results of the review to women.“The HSE will make every effort to facilitate the communication of these reports to women, or their next-of-kin, in an honest, compassionate and considerate manner. We have been working closely with healthcare professionals and patient representatives on this complex and challenging process,” a spokeswoman said.Some women whose slides are being reviewed by RCOG have alleged a lack of communication about the process, but the HSE said it had endeavoured to keep women informed of progress during the review.Women were sent updates in June and July, including information on what they could expect to receive in their personalised reports, the spokeswoman said, and an information phone-line was in operation. “A further update will issue from the HSE, on behalf of RCOG, to iniduals involved in the review before their reports are communicated to them.”Patient advocate Lorraine Walsh, one of the 221 group of women, said affected women must be offered the option of a face-to-face meeting with an expert to discuss their results. These meetings should be triaged, so the sickest women, and those with the most discordant results, are seen first. “These women have been waiting for more than a year for this process to be completed, so the very least they deserve is absolute clarity,” she said. “It needs to be about ‘women first’ and treating them with respect and compassion.”Asked for an update on the process, RCOG referred the inquiry to the Department of Health, which forwarded it to the HSE.A small number of women with micro-invasive cervical cancer, which rarely develops into invasive cancer, have been included in the RCOG review."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Farmers will be \u0026lsquodisappointed\u0026rsquo with lack of deal on increase in beef prices, says IFACo Mayo site is one of few Marian shrines worldwide to be visited by two popesGarda\u0026iacute investigating attempted raid in Virginia, Co Cavan last week search Co Meath propertiesOmbudsman rules Mary Cavner (80) eligible for redress scheme after almost six years in institutionRefusals are reflection of supply crisis in housing, says Residential Tenancies BoardRetailer announced deal in May but suspended it weeks later due to \u0026lsquoquality issue\u0026rsquoTruckers fear port delays are a foretaste of disruption to come from a no-deal BrexitSeven counties have no registered minders while Dublin has only nineIrish and EU leaders will not discuss how to manage Border until Britain leaves EUEach woman will get an assessment of their smear history compiled by RCOGFunds for modifying Waterford tenants\u0026rsquo homes to be cut by about a thirdOireachtas urges costbenefit study and more oversight in move that may delay rolloutAge-related macular degeneration is leading cause of sight loss for over Irish 50sFine Gael TD was criticised for taking personal injury claim after falling from a swingSe\u0026aacuten Kelly made comments while addressing Energy in Agriculture open day in TipperaryShannondoc claims the permit system for non-EEA nationals is driving locums awayLights were installed by Cork County Council at a cost of \u0026euro4,521Try out the key and view property in person before transferring money, students toldKilling may be linked to gangland drugs feud in the Lurgan-Portadown-Banbridge area"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3992240.1566325196!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the border runs through my bus yard and i am in my worst nightmare","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDon Reddin on the Border, which runs through his bus yard, in Muff, Co Donegal. Photograph: Trevor McBrideThe border that runs through Don Reddin’s bus yard is nothing like the one between Camden and Westminster.Here in Muff, Co Donegal, the Irish Border makes its way inland from Lough Foyle alongside a tiny stream which delineates the Republic from Northern Ireland. A set of “dragon’s teeth” – used to block Border roads during the Troubles – still stand in the area. The next crossing point is now through Reddin’s yard, after he extended it at a cost of £200,000 to give his buses a “back gate” into the North in the event of a hard Border.When the now prime minister Boris Johnson claimed, in February last year, that the Border could work in a similar way to the congestion charge in London, Reddin despaired.“I lived in London,” says Reddin. “Please, don’t insult our intelligence by coming out with that nonsense, that’s the worst nonsense I’ve ever heard.”In the three years since the Brexit referendum, Reddin has split his business into two companies – one in Northern Ireland, and one in the Republic. In his office – in the South – the Border is just outside the window.“I’m lucky that I was in the position of being so close to the Border that I could extend the yard,” he says, “and that I had the foresight to see it.”“Northern Ireland right now is further away from Europe than ever it’s been in a long, long time.”‘Worst nightmare’Johnson’s election, says Reddin, means that his “worst nightmare has become a reality. Boris Johnson has a serious lack of knowledge of Northern Ireland and a flippant disregard as to what his comments are towards Northern Ireland.”Still, on the Border the problem remains the uncertainty caused by Brexit. “The barriers are going up,” says Reddin. “The Conservative Party have gone for a pro-Brexit leader that can’t get out of Europe quick enough.“Does he understand or know anything about Northern Ireland? To my knowledge, no how can he, when he compared it to London? Me of all people, I can explain to him exactly why it’s not.“But the thing about Boris Johnson is that he doesn’t care about what the likes of myself think. He’s an MP for Henley-on-Thames. I don’t think the people of Henley-on-Thames are too bothered, and I don’t think the DUP are too bothered.“We’re jumping off the springboard into uncertainty, that’s where it’s at. There’s never been more uncertainty.”In the northwest, Reddin’s coaches are a familiar sight on both sides of the Border many pupils in Derry travel to and from school in one of the buses. His biggest issue at present is the fluctuation in exchange rates he attempts to price jobs, or tender for work, often to find that the rate has changed again.“Every time somebody like Boris Johnson opens his mouth and makes himself out to be a complete idiot sterling falls, and meanwhile you’ve priced work in this currency. I was explaining this to an English bus company and they couldn’t believe the effect it had on us, they just don’t have this problem.”He also points out that the bus and coach industry is heavily regulated cross-Border use of buses is, at the moment, based on EU regulations.“What happens after Brexit with all the transport arrangements?” asks Reddin. “When we take our Republic buses into Northern Ireland we have to have certain documents on the bus, that’s all EU – what happens to all of that? It’s back to more uncertainty.”Deeper consequenceYet Reddin’s fear is that there could be a deeper consequence. This week he had a former soldier on one of his buses. “I said to him, ‘Isn’t it a wonderful place now that we have peace’, and he agreed.“And it takes very little – look at what happened with the journalist Lyra McKee being shot. That’s what’s lurking below the surface.”Today, Reddin’s company will take four bus-loads of Catholic and Protestant children from either side of an interface area in Derry to Donegal for a day out.“They get European funding for that,” he says. “What happens if that runs out? The area they’re from, it was so ided, it was a flashpoint, and now they’re interacting with each other. I’m proud to be a part of that, I’m proud to be providing the buses for that.“But then you go into certain areas and all of a sudden the flags are back up and they’re all brand new and it’s like ision again, and Brexit is another step in that.“It makes me feel sadness. Just sadness. There’s not enough people on this island to be feeling like that.”“I’ve no comment on where we go from here, because I have no say.”What can he do? “Carry on regardless – and hope, like everyone. I have employees to pay, and it’s like playing a game of poker.“Ask me what I think – it’ll be fine. What do I really think? The Lord only knows.”Does that mean a no-deal Brexit? “I don’t know. I’m still an optimist.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3992369.1566336434!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin refuses to engage with uk on plan for no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK prime minister Boris Johnson: Several senior sources in Brussels and Dublin believe his political and diplomatic offensive is aimed primarily at a domestic audience.  Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergThe Government has refused to engage in discussions with the UK about no-deal preparations, including on how to avoid checks on the Border, in recent contacts with London, The  understands.The new British government wants to talk to Dublin about managing a no-deal exit, but Irish Ministers and officials have declined, according to three people briefed on the contents of recent exchanges.The Government and EU leaders are sticking to the position there will be no discussions with the UK on how to manage a no-deal on the Border until after the UK has left the EU, according to senior sources in Dublin and Brussels. No-deal preparations are a unilateral EU matter, they said.Relations between the EU and the UK on Brexit have worsened in recent days as the EU moved quickly to rebuff a request from British prime minister Boris Johnson to drop the backstop guarantee and open negotiations on an alternative.On Tuesday, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney pressed British Brexit secretary Steve Barclay for detail on the British proposals, made in Mr Johnson’s letter to Brussels on Monday, to substitute alternative mechanisms and guarantees for the backstop, but none was forthcoming, sources say.Looming showdownThe view in Dublin and in Brussels is that Mr Johnson is preparing for a showdown with opponents of a no-deal Brexit in parliament early next month, and a possible general election, and no serious discussions with the new British government can take place until after that process is concluded.Several senior sources in Brussels and Dublin said they believed Mr Johnson’s political and diplomatic offensive was aimed not primarily at Ireland and the EU, but rather at a domestic audience.With the EU adopting a wait-and-see attitude, there are few expectations of any progress when Mr Johnson meets the French and German leaders later this week. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the EU was being “a bit negative”, but he believed there would be agreement to drop the backstop.Dublin was encouraged by the EU’s response to Mr Johnson’s letter, however, which was quickly dismissed by the president of the European Council of EU leaders, Donald Tusk.Mr Tusk said those who wanted to drop the backstop without realistic alternatives were effectively advocating the return of a hard border in Ireland.‘Bluster’ and ‘blame’The European Parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said he did not see any majority in the European Parliament for removing the backstop from the withdrawal agreement.“It is a vital insurance policy, negotiated in good faith and supported by the people of the island of Ireland,” he said in a post on Twitter. “The time for bluster and political blame games is fast running out.”Irish officials pointed to the line in Mr Johnson’s letter to Mr Tusk where he withdrew from the commitment made by his predecessor, Theresa May, to maintain full alignment with EU rules in order to preserve an open border if the EU and UK failed to agree on others ways of doing so. “They are reneging on the commitments the British government has made before now,” said one senior Irish source. “That’s the real takeaway from this.”Meanwhile, Mr Coveney is to travel to Denmark on Wednesday and to several EU capitals next week for talks about Brexit and other EU issues. Next week, Mr Coveney will visit Prague (Tuesday), Paris (Wednesday), Helsinki (Thursday and Friday) and Warsaw (Sunday) as Brexit preparations intensify.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Stephanie LecocqThey’ll be remembered – by statisticians at least – as three golden months for the Dutch economy, March, April and May 2019, when seasonally adjusted unemployment fell to 3.3 per cent, its lowest since before the global financial meltdown in 2008 and the euro crisis that hit the following year.Even in a world of Trump and Brexit, it seemed reasonable to see those months as evidence of a new stability after the turmoil of “the lost decade”. Especially since here was an economy with an AAA rating that had created 3.3 million new jobs between 2014 and 2017, with no sign of slowing.What Ireland’s erstwhile social partners used to call “the challenges of prosperity” were – and still are, for the time being at least – everywhere to be seen.Higher wages as a result of a more competitive jobs market have led to increased consumer spending. Heartened by customers’ new optimism, businesses have responded by digging into their cash reserves, investing 5.3 per cent more in the second quarter of 2018 than in the first.Almost unnoticed, the first quarter of this year broke two records: first, it generated the highest number of new job vacancies ever for a quarter, at 316,000 – and second, it filled the highest number of vacancies ever in a single quarter, at 302,000.And house prices have been booming again, of course. They rose by an average of 9 per cent in 2018 and will probably achieve 6 or 7 per cent this year, fuelled by record low interest rates.Yet, as records were smashed and optimism bedded in, we saw the first solid evidence that the years of turmoil are far from over – and that even a country as wealthy and collaborative as the Netherlands cannot insulate itself from the unpredictability of the wider world.Twilight zoneLook at the underlying trend: Dutch economic growth was 2.9 per cent in 2017, dropping slightly to 2.6 per cent in 2018, revised downwards from 2 per cent to 1.8 per cent for 2019, and then revised downwards again from 1.5 per cent to just 1.4 per cent for 2020. That’s not a pretty picture.That key figure of 1.4 per cent for 2020 was confirmed last week by the government’s macro-economic think tank, the CPB, whose director, Laura van Geest, described the economic twilight zone in which the country is likely to reside until the new normal hits home.“Unemployment will continue to be exceptionally low in 2020, and spending power will remain strong due to a combination of real wage increases and, to a lesser extent, policy measures . . .“However, employment growth will level off, substantially, particularly in the private sector. In effect, that turning point is now behind us and the pace of the economy is already slowing.”ABN-AMRO’s chief economist, Nico Klene, was starker: “The strong deceleration in economic growth will cause job growth to weaken and unemployment will rise again, particularly next year. In addition, the government surplus will fall sharply this year and next year.”So the bottom line is that what’s currently keeping the Dutch economy coasting along is unrealistic consumer sentiment generating demand based on a time-lagged assessment of the country’s economic wellbeing.Economic sovereigntyNot alone that, but – with the budget looming next month – the real cause of its problems is well beyond the power of Mark Rutte’s government to control: “stuttering” global trade leading to “slack” Dutch exports. So much for economic sovereignty.The “known unknowns” buffering the international economy are the trade war, real or phony, between the United States and China the prospect of a hard Brexit on October 31st and political uncertainty in Italy, where a party opposed to monetary union could soon be running a country that owes European banks nearly half-a-trillion euro.If a country as dogged in its pursuit of monetary integrity as the Netherlands cannot steer clear of such treacherous economic waters, it begs the question of how it – and others like it – is to pursue its broader national interest in a world increasingly dominated by unpredictable leaders.Perhaps small countries – even former colonial powers – learn more quickly and less resentfully that for them there’s no such thing as national sovereignty, just carefully calibrated interdependence aimed at avoiding the worst blows of the hegemonic playground bully.That’s why the Dutch strategy has typically been to ally itself to a powerful partner – the EU or Angela Merkel’s Germany – and then work to punch above its weight in diplomatic terms to maximise that influence. Pretty much the sensible opposite, in fact, of Britain’s Brexit chaos."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.

According to NBC he has rallied against the wickedness of homosexuality, feminism and popular music. The Epoch Times had founders who included practitioners of Falun Gong. The NBC investigation looked into whether the movement’s views were shaping the outlet’s coverage of Mr Trump. The broadcaster talked to former reporters who worked there, including one called Steve Klett, who covered the Trump campaign in 2016 for The Epoch Times. Discussing the stories journalists were encouraged to write, Mr Klett said: “It’s like we were supposed to be fighting so-called liberal propaganda by making our own.” Donald Trump has taken a combative stance on China, not least over trade, since he took office in January 2017Some journalists were reportedly made to watch a video that laid out the Chinese persecution of Falun Gong followers when they joined the outlet. NBC reported that The Epoch Times had spent more than $1.5 million on about 11,000 pro-Trump Facebook advertisements in the last six months, citing the internet giant’s advertising archive. Falun Gong is critical of Chinese communism, which could explain why some of its practitioners are supportive of Mr Trump, who has taken a combative stance with Beijing in trade talks.Li Hongzhi, the group\u0027s founder, also reportedly argues that he is a god-like figure who can levitate and walk through walls.Falun Gong believers think the world is headed towards judgment day and that communists will be sent to a form of hell, according to former practitioners who talked to NBC. Responding to the investigation, Stephen Gregory, the US publisher of The Epoch Times, wrote an online article more than 1,000 words long which countered what NBC had reported.  “The Epoch Times is not funded by Falun Gong practitioners, nor does it speak for Falun Gong practitioners,” Mr Gregory wrote. He also said Li Hongzhi “has no role” at the outlet. Mr Gregory said: “We are committed to reporting the facts on the Trump administration, even as many other media have resorted to selective reporting and, in some cases, spread inaccurate information.”Brexit backstop explained: what is it, and why is the Irish border so important?Donald Trump calls Jews who vote Democrat \u0026#39disloyal\u0026#39Comment: Museums shouldn\u0026#39t look like they were curated by Marie KondoSir David Attenborough blasts EU over \u0026#39silly\u0026#39 interference in UK affairs, saying British people are \u0026#39fed up\u0026#39Donald Trump scraps meeting with Danish prime minister over Greenland snubCardinal George Pell loses appeal against child sex abuse convictions in AustraliaAdvert claiming chocolate bar reverses aging banned by watchdogChildren are growing up in shipping containers due to lack of council housing, report findsCarrie Symonds \u0026#39barred from entering the US over Somalia trip\u0026#39Revealed: the endangered animals sold on Facebook in the UKBritain tops healthy league table in supermarket sold food, Oxford University study findsComment: Boris Johnson needs to take on the Left\u0026#39s false prophets of hopePrivate schools are making weaker students take exams as \u0026#39external candidate\u0026#39 to protect league tablesWoman in video of Prince Andrew at Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s house is daughter of ex-Australian prime ministerGreat Scottish Run becomes first major race to create third category for non-binary competitorsAssad troops force Syrian rebels to retreat from key townFrench nightclub hostess facing charges of pimping over \u0026#39prostitution ring\u0026#39 for top footballersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 21 august 2019","story":"A man rides his bike past an art installation entitled Forever Cycles by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei in Rio de Janeiro, BrazilBrexit backstop explained: what is it, and why is the Irish border so important?Donald Trump calls Jews who vote Democrat \u0026#39disloyal\u0026#39Comment: Museums shouldn\u0026#39t look like they were curated by Marie KondoSir David Attenborough blasts EU over \u0026#39silly\u0026#39 interference in UK affairs, saying British people are \u0026#39fed up\u0026#39Donald Trump scraps meeting with Danish prime minister over Greenland snubCardinal George Pell loses appeal against child sex abuse convictions in AustraliaAdvert claiming chocolate bar reverses aging banned by watchdogChildren are growing up in shipping containers due to lack of council housing, report findsCarrie Symonds \u0026#39barred from entering the US over Somalia trip\u0026#39Revealed: the endangered animals sold on Facebook in the UKBritain tops healthy league table in supermarket sold food, Oxford University study findsUS conservative media outlet\u0026#39s ties to Chinese spiritual movement put in spotlightComment: Boris Johnson needs to take on the Left\u0026#39s false prophets of hopePrivate schools are making weaker students take exams as \u0026#39external candidate\u0026#39 to protect league tablesWoman in video of Prince Andrew at Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s house is daughter of ex-Australian prime ministerGreat Scottish Run becomes first major race to create third category for non-binary competitorsAssad troops force Syrian rebels to retreat from key townFrench nightclub hostess facing charges of pimping over \u0026#39prostitution ring\u0026#39 for top footballersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/08/19/TELEMMGLPICT000206812316_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO6-WtJp2mGWfugsIIYTZJwBYhA-_yBhJpjTJnYzZpMw.jpeg?imwidth","title":"wednesday morning news briefingbrexit starts 10 days","story":"Boris Johnson is due in Berlin tonight for supper with German chancellor Angela MerkelIf you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to our Front Page newsletter here.

But does it mean anything?Click to followThe IndependentTh end of capitalism red in tooth and claw?The wielders of the claws, America’s top CEOS, now say\u0026nbspthat they want to do cuddles.As such they’ve signed up to up to a “statement of corporate purpose”.Do firms have ethical responsibilities as stakeholders in society?This, we are told, commits them to leading their companies “for the benefit of all stakeholders – customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders” rather than just the latter together with the whims of Wall Street and its obsession with quarterly earnings.“Each of our stakeholders is essential,” the declaration concludes. “We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.”“The American dream is alive, but fraying,” said Jamie Dimon, boss of JP Morgan Chase, and chairman of America\u0027s Business Roundtable, which came up with the declaration.\u0026nbspHe went on to gush about major employers “investing in their workers and communities because they know it is the only way to be successful over the long term” while hailing the declaration’s principles as reflecting “the business community’s unwavering commitment to continue to push for an economy that serves all Americans”.Largely symbolic, said the reports that followed. But important too. \u0026nbspThose terms might look, well, mutually exclusive\u0026nbspbut let’s run with it for a bit.\u0026nbspIn theory the statement ought to matter. The guiding principle that US companies have for decades operated under was defined by the Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman, who stated that the “social responsibility of business is to increase its profits” nothing more, nothing less.\u0026nbspThat this has led us into a mess is a view opposed only by those on some of the wackier right wing shores where Friedman holds the status of\u0026nbspreligious icon.\u0026nbspI discussed how his views have been looking increasingly questionable in an essay for Independent Minds a while back.\u0026nbspDoes this declaration mean that America’s corporate titans have come around to that view too? Have they undergone a Damascene conversation?\u0026nbspTo quote the immortal Public Enemy, don’t believe the hype.\u0026nbspThere has been scant sign of these leopards changing their spots in the run up to the release of\u0026nbspthis declaration.\u0026nbspWhat we have seen, however,\u0026nbspis a notable move by the Democratic Party, and especially its progressive wing, together with\u0026nbspa shift in public sentiment.\u0026nbspThe likes of Sentators Elizabeth Warren and Senators Bernie Sanders have been sharply critical of the role big business plays in perpetuating climate change, a lack of social mobility, poor working conditions, a work until you drop culture. Their views have been gaining traction and they have been informing those of others.American legislators have, meanwhile, placed the nation’s tech titans under the spotlight in the wake of a string of ugly scandals.\u0026nbspQuestions about the business practices of the latter have been posed in other territories too, notably by the EU’s estimable Margrethe Vestager.\u0026nbspThe tide of opinion has been moving\u0026nbspagainst big business and the consensus established in the era of\u0026nbspRonald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher for some time.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

This declaration was born of self interest in response to a changing political climate.\u0026nbspIt is designed to say “look we care about the wider society in which we operate” without making any commitment\u0026nbspto actually caring. It is the distilled essence of innumerable glossy mission statements, the gushy stuff dreamed up by marketing departments so their CEOs have\u0026nbspsomething to point to when called to testify before Congress.\u0026nbspIt is ultimately utterly meaningless in the absence of action to address issues such as worker treatment, union bashing and the environmental destruction that is ultimately inimical to the interests of all the named stakeholders, including shareholders.

Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically defined as a recession.The contraction between April and June was mostly driven by sinking demand from abroad, the Bundesbank said. Exports “were down substantially”, it noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March prompted companies to build up stocks in the first quarter.“As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected,” the Bundesbank said.Appetite for German cars and other goods has also waned in China as growth in the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, partly due to the year-long trade war with the US.Up until a week ago, economists surveyed by Bloomberg were predicting\u0026nbspthat Germany’s economy will grow by 0.2 per cent in the current quarter.But since then big-name institutions including Deutsche Bank have lowered their expectations. The concern for many analysts is that continuing global trade tensions will prolong the downturn in German manufacturing and eventually feed through to the still-strong services sector.The central bank’s forecast follows weeks of disappointing economic data and news of meagre earnings at German companies. The government has signalled that it might be willing to step up spending should the downturn worsen.The European Central Bank is also considering providing extra monetary stimulus to the wider euro zone.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Figures from the Gambling Commission estimate that 55,000 children in the UK could have a gambling problem.Fruit machines remain the most common way for children to first encounter gambling but bookmakers and online casinos have come under increasing pressure over the proliferation of adverts for betting, particularly in places where children are likely to see it such as during football matches and on social media.The available evidence indicates that exposure to gambling at a young age increases the risk that a person will become addicted in later life.Twitter has become an important platform for both traditional and e-sports companies to advertise to potential customers. The study found that the five biggest operators –\u0026nbspLadbrokes, bet365, Coral, Betfred​ and Paddy Power – sent an average of 78 tweets per day.Much of this content is “designed to be widely attractive, memetic and, most importantly, shareable,” the study’s authors wrote. “As a result, it is very difficult to restrict, or even predict, the audience for a given piece of messaging.”Despite the risks of children being exposed, just 0.1 per cent of social media gambling ads were found to contain a warning about the minimum age for placing a bet.The advertising\u0026nbspindustry’s code of conduct states that\u0026nbsp“marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such” but many of the social media adverts assessed did not do this.Close to three-quarters of the gambling adverts appeared to break advertising industry regulation in some way, the researchers said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But we must do more.“The prime minister has committed to increasing school funding so we can level up all parts of the UK and close the opportunity gap.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically defined as a recession.The contraction between April and June was mostly driven by sinking demand from abroad, the Bundesbank said. Exports “were down substantially”, it noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March prompted companies to build up stocks in the first quarter.“As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected,” the Bundesbank said.Appetite for German cars and other goods has also waned in China as growth in the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, partly due to the year-long trade war with the US.Up until a week ago, economists surveyed by Bloomberg were predicting\u0026nbspthat Germany’s economy will grow by 0.2 per cent in the current quarter.But since then big-name institutions including Deutsche Bank have lowered their expectations. The concern for many analysts is that continuing global trade tensions will prolong the downturn in German manufacturing and eventually feed through to the still-strong services sector.The central bank’s forecast follows weeks of disappointing economic data and news of meagre earnings at German companies. The government has signalled that it might be willing to step up spending should the downturn worsen.The European Central Bank is also considering providing extra monetary stimulus to the wider euro zone.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So this will be giving input on a program which is concerning humanity in a major way.Dr Sivan has said that the 140 million dollar (£115 million) Chandrayaan-2 mission was the nation\u0027s most prestigious to date, in part because of the technical complexities of landing on the lunar surface - an event he described as 15 terrifying minutes.No landing has ever been attempted in the south polar region before. If the Indian team does manage the landing, it would be only the fourth country to do so after the US, Russia and China.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Figures from the Gambling Commission estimate that 55,000 children in the UK could have a gambling problem.Fruit machines remain the most common way for children to first encounter gambling but bookmakers and online casinos have come under increasing pressure over the proliferation of adverts for betting, particularly in places where children are likely to see it such as during football matches and on social media.The available evidence indicates that exposure to gambling at a young age increases the risk that a person will become addicted in later life.Twitter has become an important platform for both traditional and e-sports companies to advertise to potential customers. The study found that the five biggest operators –\u0026nbspLadbrokes, bet365, Coral, Betfred​ and Paddy Power – sent an average of 78 tweets per day.Much of this content is “designed to be widely attractive, memetic and, most importantly, shareable,” the study’s authors wrote. “As a result, it is very difficult to restrict, or even predict, the audience for a given piece of messaging.”Despite the risks of children being exposed, just 0.1 per cent of social media gambling ads were found to contain a warning about the minimum age for placing a bet.The advertising\u0026nbspindustry’s code of conduct states that\u0026nbsp“marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such” but many of the social media adverts assessed did not do this.Close to three-quarters of the gambling adverts appeared to break advertising industry regulation in some way, the researchers said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This particular skeleton - on display at the Senckenberg museum in Germany - was found in Alberta, Canada, which is also where the first Euoplocephalus fossil was found in 1897They found that oxygen levels in the atmosphere jumped from around 15 per cent to around 19 per cent. Today’s atmosphere has about 21 per cent oxygen.“We really don’t know what might have caused this increase, but we also see a drop in\u0026nbspCO2\u0026nbsplevels at that time, said lead researcher, Professor Morgan Schaller of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in\u0026nbspNew York.\u0026nbspWhat is remarkable is that right at the oxygen peak we see the first dinosaurs appearing in the North American tropics, the Chindesaurus.He added: “What we can say is that this shows that the changing environment 215 million years ago was right for their evolutionary ersification, but of course oxygen levels may not have been the only factor.”Dinosaur footprints from 170 million-years ago discovered in ScotlandChindesaurus was an upright carnivorous dinosaur around 2m long and nearly a metre high.\u0026nbspIt was found extensively in North America, with origins in the North American Tropics.Sauropods, which appeared soon after Chindesaurus, were the largest animals ever to live on land.Professor Mike Benton, of the University of Bristol, said: “The first dinosaurs were quite small, but higher oxygen levels in the atmosphere are often associated with a trend to larger size.\u0026nbspThis new result is interesting as the timing of oxygen rise and dinosaur appearance is good, although dinosaurs had become abundant in South America rather earlier, about 232 million years ago.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the recent discovery could dispute that.Dr Maidment added: “Most stegosaurs we know of, including the Natural History Museum’s Sophie, the most complete stegosaur discovered, have been found in Laurasian rock formations.“This, however may not mean that stegosaurs were not so common in Gondwana and in fact may be due to the fact that Gondwana rock formations have been subject to far fewer excavations and detailed studies.”The team said the discovery adds to the theory the Gondwanan fossil record of armoured dinosaurs is significantly biased by geological factors and collection efforts.Dr Maidment said: “What is exciting about this is that there could be many more thyreophoran dinosaurs to find in places that until now have not been excavated.”Further discoveries in the region will provide an improved view of the distribution of this group of dinosaurs and could result in a more complete specimen of Adratiklit boulahfa, the team said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The quality of decision-making has reduced. You come across decisions that are genuinely absurd. You think, how did anyone write this?” she continued.“One that comes up a lot is when they say to gay Muslim men that being gay is unacceptable in Islam, and therefore it’s implausible that they can be gay and Muslim. Or when they say to a woman who was previously in an arranged marriage with a man that she therefore cannot be gay.Asylum seeker fearing death sentence in Pakistan fighting deportationLGBT+ refugees ‘more likely to win asylum if they act flamboyant’Home Office rejects soaring number of LGBT+ asylum seekers“The Home Office do not abide by their own policy guidance. If they followed them we wouldn’t have a problem. But they don’t.”Leila Zadeh, executive director of UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, said it was not an isolated incident, citing other cases where judges have refused to believe people’s sexual orientation because of their hairstyles, their sexual behaviour or their religious beliefs.“The biggest challenge facing LGBTQI+ people in need of international protection is proving their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics,” she added.“When someone appeals against a refusal, they should be given a fair hearing without expectation that they should fit a stereotype. We urge the tribunals to ensure all judges follow the judiciary’s guidance on equal treatment of LGBTQI+ people.”Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Ed Davey said the case was “appalling” and highlighted a “culture of disbelief” towards LGBT+ asylum seekers in the UK.It comes after a study by academics at the University of Bristol\u0026nbspfound\u0026nbspLGBT+ refugees were more likely to have their asylum applications accepted if they acted up to “flamboyant” stereotypes and fit into the western notions of queergay lifestyles, such as attending Pride marches or visiting gay bars.Official figures published last November\u0026nbsprevealed the proportion of LGBT+ asylum claims rejected by the Home Office had\u0026nbspsurged in recent years, with 78 per cent of such claims refused in 2017 – a 52 per cent rise in two years.\u0026nbspOf the claimants who appeal their negative decisions – of which there were 2,908 between 2015 and 2017 –\u0026nbspmore than two thirds had their rejections overturned, the figures showed.Ms Popal said the rise in refusals was due in part to the immigration courts being under “intense pressure”, and in part due to the Home Office pushing its “hostile environment”.A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbspThe UK has a proud record of providing protection for asylum seekers fleeing persecution.\u0026nbspEach case is considered on its inidual merits by experienced caseworkers, with all available evidence carefully and sensitively considered in light of published country information.“The appeals process and decision of the judges is independent of the Government.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A practice run fell 20mph short of the record, but conditions improved on the day and a tailwind helped.Changing the aerodynamics of the car was a balance, as it decreased the 4x4’s top speed, but reduced wind resistance when the bike was released.Mr Campbell laughed: “Porsche spend millions testing their cars in a wind tunnel and we stick a big Tupperware box on the back of it!”He was so desperate to break the record that he ditched a parachute designed to help him brake quickly before the end of the airfield – because it was causing turbulence.\u0026nbspBut he did wear the latest kangaroo-skin protective suit, which inflates in the event of a crash.His next challenge will be to try to reach 220mph next year on a six-mile track at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA.He said: “This has been a five-year programme and the record was the culmination of one part of it.“We have been bound by finances and budgeted to do what we can.

killed increasing numbers of species from 2007-2017, including captive lions, parakeets, sloth bears, flamingos, elephant tusks, trunks, ears and genitalia, the report stated.\u0026nbspNumbers of animals killed by some countries’ hunters have risen sharply in recent years, including\u0026nbspCanada\u0026nbsp(216 per cent), Austria (40 per cent) and Belgium (56 per cent), although there were declines in Spain, Denmark and Norway.Labour to ban pet monkeysFrom 2008 to 2017, British trophy-hunters imported 98 primates including yellow baboons, chacma baboons and chlorocebus monkeys, from African countries such as Zimbabwe, South Africa,Zambia, Namibia, Mozambique, Botswana and Ethiopia, the wildlife watchdog\u0027s own figures show.Other targets include the critically endangered\u0026nbspblack rhino,\u0026nbsppolar bears,\u0026nbspjaguar, wolves, wild cats and lynx.Hunters even targeted the scimitar-horned\u0026nbsporyx, which is listed as extinct in the wild by the\u0026nbspIUCN, but is bred for sport on private hunting ranches.Eduardo Goncalves, of the CBTH, told The Independent: People will be bewildered to learn that trophy hunters shoot monkeys as well as better-known ‘trophy animals’ such as lions and elephants.\u0026nbspThey often live in close proximity to human habitations, so it is ludicrous to portray this as ‘sport’ hunting.These are primates with whom we share over 90 per cent of our DNA. This is as close to murder as you can get.\u0026nbspWe literally shoot ourselves in the foot when it comes to trophy hunting, as all species have an important role in the ecosystem.”Hunters spend tens of thousands of pounds on a luxury safari hunting holiday but the fee for shooting a monkey or baboon can be just a few pounds, he said.Some safari hunting firms even encourage trophy hunters to bowhunt monkeys and baboons. This increases the likelihood of painful, life-altering injuries, he added.\u0026nbspThe countries that are signed up to the Cites agreement are facing pressure as they meet in Geneva this week and next over trophy-hunting and a range of other wildlife issues.Cites has been approached to comment.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He said the paper warning of a fuel crisis and medicine shortages was an “old document” that set out “the absolutely worst case”, and insisted that the government had since taken “significant additional steps” to prepare.\u0026nbspThe implication was that the document was an overhang of the fearful defensiveness that had gripped Whitehall while Theresa May was prime minister.\u0026nbspBut yesterday it was established – and not denied by the government – that the document was dated 1 August. In other words, eight days after Johnson became prime minister, and just two and a half weeks before it was reported.\u0026nbspAnd anyone reading the Sunday Times story can see that the document was explicitly intended by its authors to be a “realistic assessment” rather than a “worst case”.Perhaps Gove thought that public opinion on Brexit was so polarised that people would believe what they wanted to believe. Therefore his job would be merely to give the supporters of a “do or die” Brexit something to reinforce their assumption that the story was part of the Remainer media’s “project fear”.\u0026nbspGovernment dismisses calls for release of no-deal Brexit assessmentsJohnson must now negotiate with the EU in good faith to avoid no dealWhy do MPs want parliament to be recalled over Brexit?But this may have been a miscalculation. There is always a middle ground in public opinion, and it might have been better to have acknowledged that the document was recent and to have claimed that it showed\u0026nbspGove was getting to grips with his ministerial brief.\u0026nbspHe could have said it was the job of civil servants to identify the possible problems of a no-deal exit so that the government could deal with them before 31 October.And instead of claiming that the document described “what the very, very worst situation would be”, he could have pointed out that it was full of “coulds”, “maybes” and “possibles” – and that his job was to make sure that these risks were minimised.Instead, the unravelling of the claims in his immediate response has meant that a bad story for the government has run on for another day.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

US-based nuclear experts have said they suspect Russia was testing a nuclear-powered cruise missile vaunted by president Vladimir Putin last year.We\u0027re ... addressing w station operators technical problems experienced at two neighbouring stations, Lassina Zerbo, head of the CTBTO, said on Twitter overnight.How 20 years of Putin has shaped Russia and the worldRussian TVs mysteriously interrupted on night of nuclear explosionTrump in ‘bizarre’ nuclear-powered missile claim after Russia blastThe CTBTO\u0027s International Monitoring System includes atmospheric sensors that pick up so-called radionuclide particles wafting through the air. Mr\u0026nbspZerbo said data from stations on or near the path of a potential plume of gas from the explosion were still being analysed.While the CTBTO\u0027s monitoring\u0026nbspnetwork is global and its stations report data back to headquarters in Vienna, those stations are operated by the countries in which they are located.The two Russian monitoring stations nearest the explosion, Dubna and Kirov, stopped transmitting on 10 August, and Russian officials told the CTBTO they were having communication and network issues, a CTBTO spokeswoman said on Monday.We\u0027re awaiting further reports on when the stations andor the communication system will be restored to full functionality.It is not clear what caused the outage or whether the stations were tampered with by Russia.Mr Zerbo also tweeted a simulation of the explosion\u0027s possible plume, showing it reaching Dubna and Kirov on 10 and 11 August, two and three days after the explosion.The spokeswoman said later that two more stations, Bilibino and Zalesovo, stopped transmitting data on 13 August.\u0026nbspBilibino is in far eastern Siberia, outside the map of the simulated plume that Mr Zerbo tweeted. But that simulation also showed the plume reaching Zalesovo on 13 August.About 48 hours after the incident in Russia on August\u0026nbsp8, these stations (Dubna and Kirov) stopped transmitting data. I find that to be a curious coincidence, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based think tank.He and other analysts said any Russian tampering with monitoring\u0026nbspstations would be a serious matter but it was also likely to be futile as other CTBTO\u0026nbspor national stations could also pick up telltale particles.There is no point in what Russia seems to have tried to do. The network of international sensors is too dense for one country withholding data to hide an event, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Non-Proliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute in California.Rosatom has said the accident, which killed five of its staff, involved isotope power sources.The CTBTO\u0027s\u0026nbspmonitoring system\u0026nbspcomprises more than 300 seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound and radionuclide stations dotted around the world that together are aimed at detecting and locating a nuclear test anywhere.Its technology can be put to other uses, however, such as when the CTBTO passed on data from two hydroacoustic stations to Argentina in 2017 to help locate the wreckage of a missing submarine.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Corbyn will do nothing, either as Labour leader or — heaven forbid! — as PM to stop us leaving.By contrast, Speaker John Bercow will “fight with every breath in my body” to stop Parliament being shut down so Britain can slip across the Halloween deadline and out of the EU.This egomaniac, known as The Poison Dwarf, is the most powerful figure in Westminster — and the most dangerous.His ambition is to go down as the most famous Speaker in House of Commons history.His hero is said to be illustrious predecessor William Lenthall, who four centuries ago backed Parliament against King Charles I, triggering the Civil War which cost Charles his head.This time, though, it will not be Parliament against the Crown. It will be rebel MPs versus the democratically expressed wishes of their own voters.Boris Johnson will not resignhe loses a confidence vote.

Hes a nice fella, its alright.But one heckler yelled: What a disgrace!Another shouted from the back: He is our leader, not the press, not Boris Johnson, or Jo Swanson!Another reporter was shouted at as he quizzed the Labour boss on whether he had enough cross-party support from MPs.And activists replied with: Shame on you!There seems to be an awful lot of whataboutery in the press at the current time, Mr Corbyn added in another hit at the media.An ITV reporter asked him why he felt people in his own party didnt want him to lead a government of national unity, but was then booed by hecklers.Mr Corbyn tried to intervene, saying: “No, Let Andy ask his question, please! I am defending your right to speak here.Another heckler muttered “Media lies.”The Labour boss is set to host Opposition MPs next week for a crunch stop No Deal summit, John McDonnell revealed today.The Labour boss also confirmed today that he wanted Boris Johnson to cancel the rest of MPs holiday and drag them back to Westminster to sort out Brexit.Thats despite the fact that more than MPs voted to go on holiday just a few weeks ago.Today No slapped down the chances of a recall and said it wasnt going to happen.James Cleverly MP, Conservative Party Chairman, said of Mr Corbyns speech today:  Jeremy Corbyn has everything he can to frustrate Britain leaving the EU on October st, and now he has confirmed he is willing to cancel the referendum result. Politicians don’t get to choose which public votes they respect.Corbyn would wreck the economy, he won’t keep our streets safe and his only answer to Brexit is more delay causing more confusion – showing he’s more interested in playing cynical party political games than respecting the referendum result.Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are committed to delivering Brexit by October st, whatever happens, so that we can deliver the change that our country needs and the people voted for.He’s spent his le appealing to the same tiny band, and until the past few years has never been trusted with the slightest genuine responsibility.He’s been able to spout off about everything from the IRA to the Middle East without ever having to actually act on his wrong-headed convictions.And, with Corbyn now Leader of the Opposition, his mindless and dangerous cult brook no dissent. Labour MPs who disagree with him are Tories in disguise.The media daring to ask him questions are “a disgrace”, as one of his barmy army put it yesterday. Voting Conservative makes you just plain evil.The contrast between Magic Grandpa and Boris couldn’t be clearer. While the latter can deliver a good gag, his record also bears the most serious scrutiny. Two terms as Mayor of London. A former Foreign Secretary.The only person around Corbyn with the slightest experience of actual power is his Shadow Chancellor. That’s John McDonnell, who was fired as London’s finance chief by Ken Livingstone for being too left wing, which is some feat…So when Corbyn claims to be a more serious, trustworthy figure than the current Prime Minister Give over, Jezza."},{"url":null,"title":"gemma collins diva forever stuffing face","story":"Luckily, boyfriend Arg has found them and is wearing them down the front of his jumper, out the back of his trousers and hanging off his chin.But I’m sure she’ll have reclaimed every ounce by the start of the next run.

They’ve not just thought of him, they’ve got the poor sod doing the voiceover.It’s only Angus Deayton, whose every word has to be extracted here with forceps and retractors, even though, truth be told, on a purely technical level it’s probably the easiest buck he’s ever earned.Cos it’s not that Diva Forever lacks a narrative, it’s just that it’s got exactly the same one every week.Gemma turns up horrendously late for an appointment.

They’re almost as bad as the men, as are their hideous children, one of whomwent missing at the end of last week’s first episode.The police have been called, search parties scrambled, the Lake District scoured and, God willing, they’ll find Anna Friel’s pants before long.Sport reporters who say “game time” instead of games.This Morning bothering to ask: “Should all doctors wear a fat suit ” And comedian Adam Rowe, who was spewing foul-mouthed class-war hatred on the “truly anti-establishment” Tez O’Clock Show a couple of weeks ago but has now reappeared fronting the Nationwide Building Society’s new advert.Workers of the world unite.

They were photographed walking in New York’s Central Park after Epstein’s conviction for securing a child for prostitution.Andrew apparently had to reassure the Queen personally he did not have relations with underage girls, though he was photographed with his arm round one of Epstein’s accusers. What a conversation that must have been.“Air-miles Andy” has long been an embarrassment to the Royal Family and the country, the best possible argument for getting rid of the monarchy.He likes to travel by helicopter to events he could just as easily reach by car.He once took a £, helicopter trip from Windsor to West Sussex, which is less than an hour and a half by car. But his profligacy is just the start.His role as a “special trade representative” from  to  cost the public £million including travel and police protection. One trip to America by private jet cost £,.And he wasn’t very good at it. Wikileaks revealed the US ambassador to Kyrgyzstan wrote of Andrew’s diplomacy: “Rude language a la British . . .  turned to the general issue of promoting British economic interests abroad.He railed at British anti-corruption investigators who had the ‘idiocy’ of almost scuttling the al-Yamamahdeal with Saudi Arabia.”Former minister Chris Bryant said of Andrew: “When I was at the Foreign Office, it was very dficult to see in whose interests he was acting.“He doesn’t exactly add lustre to the Royal diadem.”He lives in luxury with his similarly profligate and foolish ex-we Sarah at Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, which was renovated at a cost of £million when he moved in.His family are supported by the Queen’s income from the privy purse and the Duchy of Lancaster. In exchange, he performed  royal engagements in .He tried to get his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie full-time royal status — with the money too — but his brother Charles said no.He is attracted to shady dictators and the worst detritus of the international rich.Several times he met the son of former Libyan tyrant Colonel Gaddafi, Sa al-Islam — wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.Andrew had to step down from his envoy role in  over his friendship with Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan who has been criticised by Amnesty International.Again, Andrew loyally continued to visit his pal.He was also close to Goga Ashkenazi, a Kazahk socialite. So much so, Goga’s ex Timur Kulibayev — who controls much of Kazakhstan’s oil and is now married to the former Kazakh president’s daughter — paid £million for Sunninghill Park , the house Andrew shared with ex-we Sarah Ferguson.That was £million over the asking price.I have visited Sunninghill. It was ugly and peeling. Buying it was the act of a person buying access to the Royal Family.But Andrew doesn’t think about such things. He took Goga racing at Ascot and introduced her to the Queen.He is profligate, entitled and foolish. He has lived too long in a fetid world of the shady super-rich.What did he think would happen  He has the entitlement of a Royal but none of the responsibility.With vile Epstein now dead, Andrew issued a statement: “His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”This is an awful piece of PR guff, which implies that HE is the victim. How dare people think such things about him It is not good enough when the issue is child trafficking.Andrew must say what he knew and did not know. People will believe he is stupid. That is a defence of sorts. He must apologise for his poor judgement then go somewhere very quiet.I am not a monarchist. But being Duke of York and a Knight of the Order of the Garter should mean something.If Andrew were heir to the throne, the monarchy would fall over this. He should think about that —he thinks at all. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has always strenuously denied it.Rodgers’ claim will increase the pressure on Andrew to now reveal everything he knows about Epstein.The deposition to Virginia’s lawyers was released in New York  days ago. It is among , court documents relating to a settled defamation case involving her and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.Roberts claimed Maxwell, Epstein’s sometime girlfriend, groomed underage girls for him. That case was later struck out and the claims have never been tested in court.Rodgers does not allege any wrongdoing by Prince Andrew on the flights.His testimony says he flew Epstein’s private jet which ferried VIP guests including ex-US President Bill Clinton, model Naomi Campbell and sex-scandal Hollywood star Kevin Spacey.It also claims Andrew was aboard a number of times, including two flights with Virginia.He says the Virgin Islands flight took place on  April  — with Maxwell also among the guests.Rodgers’ also claims Andrew was on a flight on  March from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Florida.He says others passengers on the -seat Gulfstream jet included Epstein, Maxwell and Virginia.Royal Court Circular documents show Andrew had engagements in London on March  and April  — so it is possible he could have been on the Epstein plane.Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in jail ahead of a trial for sex trafficking minors. Buckingham Palace refused to further clary Andrew’s movements over that period. On April  Andrew began an official visit to the US — arriving in New York that day.Flight logs show Virginia flew to New York with Epstein on April .The Prince also flew to Boston for official engagements before ing to New York on April . On that day, Rodgers says Andrew flew from New Jersey to the Virgin Islands.Court Circulars do not state Andrew’s whereabouts for the next few days — but a newspaper report places him “in the Bahamas” by April .Rodgers also claims that on  August  Prince Andrew was on the maiden flight of Epstein’s infamous “Lolita Express.”The Boeing , replacing his Gulfstream, had a bed which Epstein allegedly used for orgies.The Duke did not have any diary events listed for August .There are also discrepancies in Rodgers’ testimony. He claims Andrew was on a  July  flight from the Virgin Islands to Florida along with Roberts and Epstein.But the Royal diary shows he was in the UK on that date. Flight logs for the trips do not feature Andrew’s name but the initials AP.The initials had previously been used for Epstein’s designer Alberto Pinto. Rodgers identies Andrew in his testimony. The initials AP may have also been used for Epstein’s chef Adam Perry Lang.Billionaire Epstein, , hanged himself in jail on August .The inquiry is now focusing on several alleged co-conspirators, believed to include Maxwell, , the daughter of disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell.Virginia claims she was held a sex slave by Epstein and trafficked to his friends while a teenager.A source close to Andrew said: “If law-enforcement agencies or police want to talk to the Duke or any royal they just need to ask.”Buckingham Palace said: “This evidence statement was submitted in a case in which the Duke was not a party and in which any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.“The statement shows a number of inconsistencies between the Duke’s alleged location and his actual location when checked with the court circular. In some cases he is on dferent continents.“It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.“Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.A WOMAN seen with the Duke of York at Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan appears to be a daughter of a former Australian prime minister, it was claimed yesterday.Katherine Keating, , whose father Paul was PM from  to , is thought to be the figure Andrew, , was filmed waving goodbye to.The  video, two years after Epstein, , admitted paying a teen girl for sex, emerged over the weekend.Ms Keating’s pals say the similarities went “right down to the beauty spot on her left cheek”.There is no suggestion she was aware of or involved in Epstein’s crimes.Prince Andrew denies any wrongdoing.By early , the former political adviser was living in New York with her younger sister Alexandra.Court documents allege that at least  underage girls were brought to Epstein’s mansions for sexual encounters.He pleaded not guilty to child sex trafficking charges in New York and faced  years in prisonfound guilty.On July , a federal judge said that the disgraced financier presented a danger to the community and must stay in one of New Yorks toughest prisons while awaiting trial.The shamed financier was locked up amid fears he would flee the country.Epstein hanged himself on August  - just  days after being removed from suicide watch.But questions remained over how he he managed to take his own le without being stopped by guards.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or perhaps it’s gingerism Either way, it’s smoke-and-mirrors nonsense designed to deflect from the reality that the public is wearied and irritated by the constant proselytising of a young couple who don’t appear to practise what they preach.This is the problem when Royal Family members abandon the monarchy’s long-held tenet of “never complain, never explain” and start making political statements about how the proles should live their lives.It’s an obvious side-effect that, emboldened by the proleration of social media, one’s once loyal subjects might rise up and have a few strident opinions of their own.Particularly when they’ve just contributed £.million for your “cottage” to be done up.Sir Elton John — with whom they have been staying on their most recent holiday to Nice — appears to blame the media for what he claims was a “distorted and malicious” account of the trip, adding for good measure that he wanted to protect the young couple from the “unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death”.Hmmm. Putting aside the observation thatyou want to avoid press coverage then boarding a private plane to stay with an A-lister is perhaps ill-advised, it’s widely acknowledged that Princess Diana was safely ensconced inside the Paris Ritz when she and Dodi took the fateful decision to leave their suite at midnight and get in a car that, unbeknown to them, was being driven by someone . times over the limit and speeding.A French judicial investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.But eventhey had been, just like the detracting cry of “racism”, Harry’s tragic loss of his mother shouldn’t be used to try to shut down valid criticism about him and Meghan virtue-signalling their “woke” credentials then hopping on four flights that emit an estimated seven tonnes of CO.Judging by online message boards, the Diana-loving public certainly aren’t buying it.I’ve been a journalist for a long time and know that, whatever I choose to write, people make up their own mind about the issues of the day.And the majority view on the royal couple’s gas-guzzling transportation is that it’s hypocritical.Equally, climate change activists say the same. Or are they being misquoted by the evil media Harry’s impeccably dutul grandmother the Queen understands that the role of the Royal Family is to turn up to a community centre on a wet and windy day and shake the hands of those in society who put in real graft on behalf of others — therefore highlighting a good cause and hopefully encouraging others to do their bit.In other words, leading by example rather than constantly telling everyone how they should be thinking and feeling.Particularly when the Smiths of Acacia Avenue are being made to feel guilty for boarding a budget airline on their one week’s holiday a year and don’t have multi-millionaire friends to offset their carbon foot-print with an “appropriate contribution” to a climate change initiative.It’s a simple truth that, were the Sussexes buckling down and just quietly getting on with their royal duties like Princess Anne et al, they could visit Beyonce George Elton whoever on privately-funded luxury flights and few would question it.But entitled “do as we say, not as we do” hypocrisy should always be called out.IT was perhaps inevitable that the marriage of Strictly pro dancers Neil and Katya Jones would hit the rocks after that kiss.After all, the encounter between Katya and her Strictly  partner Seann Walsh wasn’t just any old snog, it was a Marks  Spencer’s chocolate pudding snog – all dark and mysterious with an explosive centre.It was furtive, hurried, messy and forbidden – everything that a kiss within the confines of a long-term relationship rarely is.However drunk you are, you only kiss someone like that when you’re a a teenager at the local disco or b looking for something, or someone, that’s missing from what you already have.And that’s a tough reality to move on from.Bruised by the humiliation of glaring headlines and the unremitting scrutiny of the public gaze, it’s understandable that they deployed “nothing to see here” mode – swearing undying love for each other and clamping on fixed smiles for any photographer within a -yard radius.But behind closed doors, the recriminations clearly began and, ten months on, their -year relationship is over.The end of a marriage is always sad but, all credit to them, they have vowed to remain friends and professional dancing partners.Now they can both kiss who they want.THE new leader of Ukip is a Richard Braine – a name that has led to plenty of “Dick Braine” ­joshing and articles about other people with ­unfortunate monikers.One of them being my nemesis on a charity edition of The Chase. “Which of these is a Dutch politician ” Bradley Walsh asked me . . . for £,.Ruud Bum, Luuk Bonkers or Tiny Kox were the options and I went for Ruud on the basis footballer Ruud Gullit was from the Netherlands and no one who spoke English as well as the Dutch do would call their son Tiny Kox.But, as this photo shows, I was shocked to learn it was Tiny Kox, a Dutch senator and Socialist Party­ member.He’ll fit right in should he choose to pay a visit to Corbyn and his comrades.FORMER Page  favourite Linda Lusardi is now  and has posed in the same gold bikini she wore in her modelling heyday.If anything, she looks better in it now.She credits her youthful look to good genes and not eating unless she’s hungry, but there’s another crucial factor too – happiness.Linda has been married to actor Sam Kane for  years and a more easy-going, devoted couple you could not wish to find.She says: “I’m in a good place. I have a very happy le, happy marriage and two great kids who are doing what they want to do. That’s all I need.”Indeed. Inner contentment is the greatest anti-ageing formula there is.Don’t I know it.In Mexico, The Bloke said: “Seen one old building, seen ’em all,” as I headed off to Chichen Itza and he headed for a sun lounger.And when I once suggested a safari in Africa, he replied: “No thanks, I’ll watch it on the Discovery Channel.”I got him to come to Rome’s Colosseum once, but only because it was raining and there was a recommended restaurant right opposite.Dear reader, I married him.MICHAEL Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones have posted a charming photograph of a family lunch that includes their two teenage children, Michael’s brothers and nephews, and his once troubled son Cameron from his first marriage.Now , Cameron – who credits Catherine and Michael for sticking by him – has turned a corner and is happily married with a young daughter.Also there were Michael’s dad Kirk, , and stepmum Anne, .Proof,needed, that Hollywood royalty or not, every family has its ups and downs and all that matters as your le nears its end are the loving people that  surround  you.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So after a tough year battling health problems and grieving over the death of his daughter, Mike started his weight loss journey in August .    The last conversation I had with my daughter was I had to try and be around to help my son in law with her kids, -year-old Mike said. I was being selfish. It is only when I lost my daughter did I realise thatsomething happened to me, I would be leaving everyone  behind. The reason why I have done thisis not for my own personal gain, but for everybody. My goal was to make sure I could be around for my family and you could not get a better motivation than that.Mike, who is originally from Penygraig but now lives in Caerphilly, was . stone when he joined Slimming World in August .He now weighs . stone, averaging his weight loss to around a stone a month. Mikeaposs weight loss, which he credits as the single best achievement in his le, has now totalled . stone.    He said he was putting his le in danger with his daily diet which mostly included a handful of pasties for breakfast, multiple sandwiches for lunch and a takeaway for dinner, as well as snacks throughout the day. Mike has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease , which is a condition that affects the lungs and makes it dficult to breathe. He also has an atrial fibrillation of the heart - a condition that causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate. Both conditions are incurable but can be managed by medication. But Mikeaposs weight was putting a huge strain on his body, which was having a bad impact on his health. With the COPD, the weight was crushing my lungs and it was so straining. It also meant that my heart had to work a lot harder because I was carrying so much weight. Mike was hospitalised at the beginning of  due to the strain his weight was putting on his body. At that point, he was . stone. Now I have lost all this weight, it has got a thousand times better. I feel fitter now than I did when I was in my s. Before Breakfast Breakfast for Mike was usually on the go, as he rushed to work in the morning. This consisted of a handful of pasties and pastries. Lunch A typical lunch for Mike usually meant multiple sandwiches bought from a shop.Mike said that on his Slimming World diet, he can still eat things like sandwiches, as long as it is brown bread and made at home, where he knows what is being put into it. Dinner Mike relied on a lot of take aways for his dinner, frequently eating Chinese food and other quick and easy options. After Mike credits the success of his diet to being able to eat a lot of the same foods, but just in a healthier way. His favourite Slimming World meal is beef, mushrooms, peppers and tomatoes, served with Slimming World style chips or potatoes. I get beef from my local butchers which is about % fat. I cook mushrooms, peppers and tomatoes in Fry Light with an OXO cube over the top. And as it is simmering I will add in beef stock and pour it over the top and let it simmer and it makes it more tender. I do a Chinese curry, a fried rice, or pork. Sometimes I do a special fried rice with veg and mushrooms. It is stuff that you would eat normally but you cook it in a dferent way.   The plasterer credits his weight loss to the amazing support he received from his Slimming World Group in Trealaw, Rhondda . Iaposm still eating a lot of the things that I used to eat, but the way I am cooking it is a lot better. I still have special fried rice and other takeaway-style food, but instead I make them myself. We call them fakeaways.

Whittingham, wearing a retro Manchester United top, boarded the Ryanair flight from the popular holiday resort with a litre bottle of whisky from duty free and was being loud and obnoxious. He immediately got into an argument with another passenger about football, with his behaviour deteriorating from there, the Manchester Evening News reports.    During the flight he pushed an air steward, making contact with his face as he rummaged through a drinks trolley looking for a glass. He also struck the man sitting next to him in the face, knocking his tooth out. As the flight landed late on February  this year he launched an attack on the man he had originally been arguing with about football. At several points  consideration was given to erting the plane , prosecutors told Manchester Crown Court last week. And by the time the plane landed at  Manchester Airport  the pilot could hear the shouting and screaming coming from the cabin. As it was taxiing he was forced to lean out of the cockpit window and ask officers waiting on the tarmac below to get on as soon as the doors were opened as the situation had got out of control.    He then punched and bit a police sergeant who got on to try and arrest him. He was jailed for  months for endangering an aircraft and assault causing actual bodily harmlast Friday.

Meanwhile there are horried screams and shouts from his fellow travellers to pack it in and get the f***k off him! as there are kids in the plane man. Officers boarded not long after the clip was filmed and Whittingham flew at one of them, leaving him with a swollen and bloodied nose and lip , as well as a bite mark after clamping his teeth on his chest at the side of his body armour.

The former air hostess and model - who didnapost wear sun cream on holiday - cut back when she noticed a scabby lump on her forehead, but it was too late. She was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma - a type of skin cancer - and surgeons were forced to cut it out of her forehead in a zig zag shape, needing  stitches. The mum-of-one has been left with a scar like Harry Potter - and is urging others to slather on the sun cream and stay away from sunbeds.    Erica, from Coventry, West Midlands, said: I donapost think anyone will ever understand the sadness I felt when I looked in the mirror for the first time the next morning. Thataposs when it really hit me and I had a bit of a meltdown. To see the damage that I was left with from the skin cancer and know it was caused from long-term use of sunbeds and sunbathing was heartbreaking.    What I am now left with is a permanent reminder of those sunbed visits and sun cream neglect. I am also left with soreness and pain across my head due to nerve damage and the healing process. Thankfully, I can take a deep breath and remind myself that I am free from cancer - I am the lucky one. Erica started using sunbeds when she was  after being introduced to them by her friends who wanted to look tanned all year round. For years she would holiday abroad and spend time in the sun without sunscreen, hoping to achieve the perfect holiday glow.  She used them four to five times a week until her late s when she cut down to twice a week because she was starting to look old. But in February  Erica began her career as a VIP cabin crew member for a private jet company, which saw her flying to tropical destinations where she could enjoy the sun. But when the self-confessed sunbed addict spotted a mark on her forehead in , she realised it was time to cut back and get safe in the sun. I noticed deep lines had started to appear on my face as well as age spots,apos Erica said. I realised I needed to start looking after my skin, and used high factor sun-cream on my face to try to halt the ageing process from then on. But I continued to use sunbeds - just less frequently - as I still wanted to be tanned for my new job.  I started to spend all of my time either in the sun or on an aeroplane, which wasnapost great for my skin but I was having the time of my le. Having modelled on a freelance basis since her mid-s, Erica saw an increase in her modelling work later on in . She worked for high-end clients such as F and did promotional modelling for superbikes, and felt on top of the world despite juggling two jobs. It wasnapost until late , while at the gym with a friend, that she noticed a small lump on her forehead. My friend commented on a small mark, which looked a bit like a big mole,apos Erica said.  I had already been to the GP about it who told me it was nothing to worry about, so I just shrugged it off and carried on with my workout - but later on I started to think about it more and more. The small area at the top right of her forehead would occasionally scab for no apparent reason and would become sore to the touch every now and again. Erica noticed it had also begun to grow in size so kept going back to her GP - only to be given the same advice. They reassured me it was nothing to worry about, but I was definitely worried, especially when friends and family would continue to point it out to me. I felt self-conscious of the obvious mark on my forehead, which had now also started to become an indent and about cm across.  In October , Erica was finally referred to a dermatologist by her GP, and in early  a biopsy revealed it was BCC. You canapost really explain the feelings you have when the aposbig C wordapos is put in front of you,apos Erica said. It was a complete bombshell, but a huge relief when they told me it hadnapost spread any further than the mark on my head.apos In February , Erica had surgery to remove the lump, which had grown to cm, and it ended her modelling career, she said. My surgeon has said it can take up to two years before it heals properly, but that I may never be free from the pain, she said.

Steve Booth, who starred for the Leicester Tigers, tragically died the day he was due to pick up the diamond engagement ring he had ordered for his fiancee Danielle Watts. The -year-old and his partner, who had two young children together, had just ed from a family holiday to Mexico and were excitedly making plans for their future. Grief-stricken Ms Watts told Leicestershire Live that she picked up the ring he had ordered for her, adding: “I will wear it in memory of Steve. “It’s just a shame that after all this time he won’t get to place it on my finger.” She has since found out that he had an undiagnosed heart condition.    She added: “Everything was going so well. We had just come back from a lovely family holiday to Cancun in Mexico and he had proposed to me. “He had proposed to me a few times over the years but we had both just laughed it off. This time he was serious. “Steve meant it and we were excitedly making plans to go back out to Cancun to get married out there as we had had such a great time. It feels surreal that he is no longer here with us.” Mr Booth had been complaining of heartburn in the days before he died on August , his fiancee said.    The couple, who had been together for  years, had two children together - nine-year-old Maisie, who helped to pick out the engagement ring, and five-year-old Jack. Mr Booth was a fan favourite after joining the Tigers in , making  appearances and scoring  tries over four years. The club won two Premiership titles, two Heineken Cups and England A honours during his time there. He had set up his own digital design business in Blaby after retiring.  Mr Booth, who lived near Glen Parva, Leicestershire, complained of bad heartburn on August , the day after the family ed from Mexico. Ms Watts, a self-employed hairdresser, said: He took some tablets and felt much better. “On Sunday [August ] we all went to the gym. He went into the gym for a weights session the joined us in the pool. He was very fit and always serious about maintaining his fitness. “He complained about more pain but took some more tablets.”  After playing squash on the morning of August , Mr Booth agreed to go to a walk-in centre with Ms Watts. She said: “They took his blood pressure and checked him over. They gave him some tablets and said he seemed to be okay but told him to go to hospitalhis condition got worse. That night, Mr Booth proposed to Ms Watts at home. She said: “It was wonderful. He meant it. I said yes. He told me he had ordered the ring that Maisie had helped to pick.  “We were like a couple of kids being all excited about spending the rest of our lives together.” Mr Booth went to work on August  and again complained of heartburn.  Ms Watts said: “I was worried and texted him to say so. He texted back saying: aposI’m okay now. Don’t worry about me. It’s good.apos “That was the last text he sent me.” Mr Boothaposs colleague called her soon after to tell her he had collapsed.  Ms Watts said: “I rushed there but there was already an ambulance there. “Paramedics were working on Steve. He passed away there, at his office. “His colleagues told me that Steve was laughing and joking to the end. They said he was cracking jokes as he was sitting in his seat. Apparently, he tried to stand up, then sat back down and closed his eyes and that was it. He collapsed.”  Ms Watts was later told he had an undiagnosed heart condition. She added: “It means he could have died at any time. There was nothing anyone could have done.” She recalled how the couple met on a night out in Leicester city centre more than a decade ago, saying: “I was with friends in the Fat Cat Bar when I had to go to the loo. I walked past this guy and he pinched my bum. I could not believe it. “I glared at him to let him know in was not impressed at all. “When I came back from the toilet he did it again.

I saw Dean Weymes celebrating his win and just thought Iaposd have a punt. I downloaded the National Lottery app in the bath, put a tenner in my account and then played a Lucky Dip. Sam, who is yet to pass his driving test, went downstairs after his bath to learn heaposd won the Set For Le second prize.    He added: It was only an hour, maybe  minutes, after I first played when I saw a message on my phone and it said Iaposd won the second prize - £k a month for  months. Having never played before I asked Connie to take a look. But like me, she had never played before so we called her brother Craig, whoaposd played the National Lottery for years. He said aposon my way, donapost moveapos and within five minutes he was at my front door. We checked the tickets and sat there in disbelief wonderingit was true.    Sam and Connie, a HR worker, are set to swan off to New York for a holiday of a letime after his work gave the green-light. A deposit for a home is also high on their priority list. He added: I canapost actually believe that Iaposm going to be able to do these things - and do them right now. Everything still seems quite unreal - the news really is still sinking in. The next thing on my list is a driving licence. I havenapost passed my test and with a small family I need wheels, maybe a BMW  series. The win will allow me to learn to drive and get a car straight away - which is amazing.

The car, which was given to Sian by her grandmother as a gt after her grandfather died, contained her laptop, phone, iPod and a bank card.Her bank card was later used in a shop and garage in Radclfe, the Manchester Evening News reports.Sian was driving on the southbound carriageway close to junction  at around .am when she says she narrowly avoided being hit by a speeding car, which was weaving in and out of traffic.Moments later, she watched in shock as the car smashed into the central reservation.She told how it flipped several times, left the carriageway and came to rest down an embankment.

A woman askedanyone had a red VW, and said a guy just came up covered in blood said aposIaposm drunkapos and had driven off. It was one of the most surreal conversations Iaposve ever had. One of the other witnesses offered to give Sian a lt off the motorway to her workplace, before she went home in shock. Her family have been forced to change their locks, while Sian has had to cancel her cards - but before she was able to do that, the thief used them in a Texaco garage and newsagents in Radclfe.  Sian added: I just donapost get how anybody can be in a crash that bad and their first thought is aposIaposm going to get back in another car thataposs not even mineapos. The traffic police said this is the first time they have seen anything like this. Itaposs not so much the fact that heaposs taken my stuff, itaposs the feeling of being violated.

But now, the potentially deadly disease has ed as fewer children are being vaccinated. The MMR vaccine is offered from free on the NHS and protects against measles, mumps and rubella. Two doses of the jab mean  percent of people are protected against one of the worldaposs most contagious diseases. Two jabs have been offered in the UK since  but a damning report by now disgraced doctor, Andrew Wakefield, has seen take-ups of the vaccine decline.    The majority of the new measles cases are now being found in people who have not been vaccinated. In the first three months of this year alone there have been  cases of measles compared to just  in the whole of . Experts from the World Health Organisation, who have revoked the UKaposs measle-free status because of the sharp rise in the number of cases, say some people may be opting out of the vaccine because they have become complacent to the risk of measles. But another key factor is the publication of Wakefieldaposs research in the late s. In it, he claimed there was a link with the MMR vaccine and autism, which has now been discredited and Wakefield struck off the UKaposs medical register.    And his damning report not only led to a downturn in the number of people having the vaccine in Britain, it also affected take-up rates in the US. The MMR vaccine is a totally safe jab. Wakefield is now a staunch supporter of the anti-vaccination movement and has even directed a film, Vaxxed, which claims to show a US health cover-up. However, the film had to be withdrawn from the Tribecca film festival after founder Robert De Niro would not allow it to be included. Despite this, Wakefield is said to have several powerful supporters, including US President Donald Trump.    But despite the controversy surrounding the disgraced doctor, he is reported to be in a relationship with one of the worldaposs most beautul women - model Elle Macpherson. Dubbed The Body because of her stunning figure and ageless beaut, the pair were snapped buying organic vegetables from a supermarket and kissing as they made their purchases. His relationship with the model came after he and his we, Carmel, along with their children fled to the US at the height of the controversy following the publication of his MMR research. Wakefield is believed to have left the family home early last year and is said to have met Elle shortly aftewards at an awards ceremony.    They have been snapped holding hands together several times since and Wakefield is said to be infatuated with the supermodel, known for her healthy lestyle.Brian Burrowes, the man who edited Wakefieldaposs controversial documentary Vaxxed, told Mail Online : Heaposs obviously a bit infatuated. He did say to me aposBrian, how did this happen aposI laughed and said I really didnapost know how this happened. Iaposm just really happy for him. Elle and Wakefield are also said to have enjoyed several mini-breaks, visiting friends. The model is also reported to be responsible for Wakefieldaposs trimmer figure after introducing him to dferent health foods and switching up his wardrobe. Autism campaigner Polly Tommey said: Elle is such a sweetheart. Sheaposs got him on these shakes now for his lunch and dinner.

Randenige Thilakarathna, , a wealthy supermarket and hotel owner from the Sri Lankan town of Kegalle, insists he has spent a fortune on veterinary care for the -year-old elephant. He said his family loved Tikiiri and sent the Mirror pictures and video of her grazing on their land. Speaking via his -year-old son Champika, who gained a tourism degree in Britain, Randenige said: “We do not need money from any elephant charities because we have enough money and we have been treating Tikiri very well. “Tikiiri has had a stomach problem for five months, and has problems chewing because of her age, but we have made sure she has received Sri Lankan medicine and English medicine and she’s getting better.  “It’s been very, very upsetting to have so much criticism from around the world. The people who say these things do not know about treating an elephant. We have used only vets who specialise in elephants. “The people in our village never ask us how Tikiiri is because they know she is being cared for. Tikiri is our only elephant and very loved by our family. We would never mistreat or harm her.” Champika, who attended Glyndwr University in London, said his family had owned Tikiiri for eight years. Harrowing pictures of Tikiiri’s emaciated body caused an international outcry when she walked, while short-shackled, in a y parade during the ten-day Perahera Festival in Sri Lanka. This year was the th consecutive year Tikiiri took part in the parade – but the family withdrew her from the finale after she collapsed from exhaustion. Champika said: “We would not have let her paradeour vet had not said she was getting better. She collapsed because she is old and tired. But now she is standing up, eating well, is putting on weight and is happily back at home. “We have people with her all the time. We would never neglect her. She is being well looked after and loved to make sure her last years are as happy and healthy as can be.” The claims have been backed up by the Millennium Elephant Fund, the charity that first circulated the pictures of Tikiiri in the parade. In a statement, it said animal activist Champa Fernando had visited Tikiiri on Monday.

It’s getting children off the iPad, getting them out and about exploring.“They get to hide it again for someone  and it’s almost like a little adventure for them. It’s a parent interaction as well and getting that parent partnership with the kid, sitting down and reading the book.“It’s just really a little something dferent, everyone seems quite keen on the idea. I think we have hidden about  just within this week.“I’m out and about everyday with the kids. I’ve only got so many books as well, I did have go buy some. If people could hand in books we could keep it going.“If everybody gets behind it, it can continue and go on for as long as it can. It has been a great response so far for just getting started.“I think all the books that we have had out so far have been found and parents have sent in pictures of it after they have collected them.”Parents are getting into the swing of things, with one already having re-hidden a book in Baxter Park.Lori said: “It will be nice to seeit’s found again.“The books are in zip lock bags which will hopefully be watertight.”Lori also includes a note in the bag to anyone who comes across it which says she hopes they enjoy the book as well as asking for a photo of the cover, or a photo of the person who found it, to be sent to her Facebook page before it’s re-hidden.She added: “I just think it’s good for the community, there’s not a lot for kids in Dundee to do to keep them physically active other than the soft play.“It was just really something a bit dferent for the children that doesn’t cost money for the parents.“As a mother myself and a childminder I am always looking for things to do for the children.“I’m just happy to be able to give something to the community.”It’s not the first time Lori has created a project for kids.Children she looks after have previously created their own fairy drawings to be hung around trees in the local community.And, as revealed last week in the Tele, the idea of hiding gts for others to find then hide themselves has been explored by Karen Mitchell, who paints rocks with band logos and hides them across Dundee and further beyond. "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d56cea005fae3.34061587.jpg ","title":"dundee united bosses spend 250k over summer to bring tannadice up to scratch","story":"Dundee United’s American owners have forked out a quarter of a million pounds over the summer to make sure Tannadice is up to scratch.And the spending to make it one of the best grounds in the country will continue over the next few years.Tangerines managing director Mal Brannigan, while stressing no criticism was being aimed at previous regimes, has revealed the one surprise millionaire Mark Ogren and his son Scott got after buying United was the extent of work needed to the stadium.However, he was delighted with their belief it should be undertaken as a matter of urgency.Since the end of last season, that’s seen almost £, spent on the Eddie Thompson Stand and an ongoing refurbishment of the Executive Lounge and Captain’s Suite underneath the Jerry Kerr Stand.Other improvements sanctioned by the owners include the new ticketing system that’s now in operation and the installation of a fibre optic ring covering the entire stadium.“The one thing that did catch us a little bit by surprise when we came in was probably the amount of investment we needed to put into Tannadice to bring her back up to speed and to better the facilities the fans were experiencing,” explained Brannigan.“It was not necessarily an enormous surprise but, at the same time, we were probably a little bit behind where we thought we would be and we have addressed a lot of that stuff during the summer, so, when we go forward, we have good foundations in place.“We’ve done a lot of infrastructure work. Fans will be able to look up in the Eddie Thompson and look up to the rafters and see there’s a lot of paint work that’s gone on there.“We’ve re-netted the steelwork underneath that as well. That was something that would have had to have been done for a number of years, wasn’t done, and was something that needed addressing.”As an experienced football administrator working in senior positions at clubs like Derby County, Sheffield United and Coventry down south, as well as Dundalk in Ireland, he understood why such work was not being done by previous regimes.“Money goes to the team or somewhere where there’s a commercial . It’s always worth investing,money is tight, in somewhere where you can create actual additional working capital for the business and I have done it working in other football clubs.“I completely understand the position the club was in. It was disappointing for ourselves in the fact it was something we’ve had to pay for but it was a reflection in the price paid.”Brannigan believes a pleasant offshoot of the work that’s been going on and will continue is it’s been the best way of the Americans showing fans they’re at United for the long haul.It’s also further proof Tannadice will remain United’s home.“There’s been no commercial benefit from the work on the Eddie Thompson Stand, it was about making sure that the stadium looks in the right light again going forward.“And Tannadice is our home and there have been no conversations or chat around the boardroom table about moving anywhere . It’s all about improving here.”More work is planned and a lot of that will be undertaken over the next few summers.“I think it took us a few months to look at the football club and to see where’s good, where we would need to improve, where we would need to go in a dferent direction,” added Brannigan. “I think that’s probably going to be ongoing for the next couple of years.”"},{"url":null,"title":"fans take stag do to sporting kansas city to meet former dundee united star johnny russell","story":"Former Dundee United footballer Johnny Russell received a blast from the past as a group of fans travelled across the globe to pay him a visit.The Tangerines fans, reportedly on a stag-do, visited MLS side Sporting Kansas City for their clash against San Jose Earthquakes on Saturday.Russell spent six years at Tannadice, as well as playing  times for Scotland, before joining Derby County in .The Dundee United fan favourite joined the MLS side in , signing a three-year deal.mdash Dundee United FCAugust , After the game, Russell made his way across the pitch to greet the group of men, signing autographs and sharing a joke with them."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/05/5cee68ff034d24.02416017.jpg ","title":"mcpake wants 100 from players in league after dundees dons cup disappointment","story":"James McPake has backed his players to repeat the amount of effort put in against Aberdeen as theyto league duties this weekend.The Dark Blues face Inverness Caley Thistle at Dens Park this Saturday aiming to continue their unbeaten start in the Championship.They did suffer their first defeat of the campaign on Sunday as the Dons came away with a - extra-time victory in the Betfred Cup.McPake’s side, though, took plenty of plaudits for their performance in the  minutes with their one-goal lead only equalled in stoppage time by the Premiership outfit.The Dens boss might have been frustrated with the result but not the application from his men – something they’ll need to show again in the tough league games coming up.McPake said: “We’ll analyse it and see where we can be better but I thought my players were excellent in terms of everything and I think a second goal would have been enough because I think we were that dominant in the game.“That would have allowed us to control the game a bit better by keeping the ball a bit better.“We were a little more direct than what we have been but it worked.”The Dens gaffer revealed some of his players were running on empty as the clock ticked down, forcing him into substitutions late in the game.“There were crucial parts in the game,” he added.“Having to take Jamie Ness off because he just blew up – credit to him, he’s just come back and you could see why I was so desperate to sign him.

And his Tarbert roots run deeper, he was the head chef in Stonefield Castle in  where he met his we Irene, whose family still live in the village.Together with his son Ryan and Ross Payne from the Anchor Hotel the chefs settled in for an afternoon of cooking the finest seafood for the  seafood lovers who had booked their tables though the festival’s Facebook page.No one was left hungry as food started to arrive on tables and by the end of the afternoon there nothing left to cook and the chefs could have a welcome break.While the sunshine certainly added to the enjoyment of this new seafood experience Mike was delighted with the lunch service, saying: ‘It’s been a fantastic day, everyone enjoyed themselves and most of all we’ve raised over £ for the festival. We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival. I’d also like to thank Seafood Scotland who helped with the funding of our equipment.‘Cooking in front of the boats which caught the fish was pretty spectacular.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

HEARING has been held by Scottish Government officials to discuss the proposed new wind farm at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced

Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic....

Whatrsquos more, this system is central to the country reducing its CO emissions, whilst being more reliable, sustainable and cost-effective.The increased complexity of the system and the need to be able to flexibly match supply and demand means that digitalisation is an important part of the transition. Central to digitalisation is the accurate measurement of customer energy demands so the system can provide energy in the most efficient and costeffective way, and customers can accurately understand how they use energy. And that is where smart meters ndash available from your energy supplier at no extra cost - come in.Simply put, smart meters will make Britainrsquos energy grid, and energy system, smarter. This is because the data that they are able to generate allows our energy network to understand how much energy is being used, when and where across Great Britain.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really important to put your bucket down every now and then, and that can make it easier to empty as well."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-railway-isn-39-t-perfect-39-s-better-driving","story":"Sure, things

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value.

As an independence supporter, Irsquom growing steadily sick, and increasingly tired, of the antics of some on my own side.It seems that every other day now, alienating behaviour from what should be the fringes of the Yes movement becomes the focus of attention, playing into the hands of opponents of independence.Itrsquos especially frustrating at a time like this, when a hard-right government in Westminster led by Boris Johnson is a gt for those who support independence. Yet, instead of wooing soft Unionists with a smile and a handshake, the Yes movement is seen by some as flag-wrapped, shouting and snarling. It makes no sense.:Could Nicola Sturgeon push the nuclear button to get a second referendum Increasingly, friends of mine who are No voters say they are coming round to the idea of independence. Theyrsquove no emotional attachment to independence but the madness unfolding at Westminster means they could envisage themselves one day voting for separation. However ndash and itrsquos a huge however ndash they all say theyrsquore not quite there yet, and the issue that puts them off independence the most is the aggression and bullying they associate with the Yes movement.When you tell them that online Unionist trolls are just as bad, they simply donrsquot believe you. The experience of Yes supporters may be one of Unionist abuse and bullying, butyoursquore a Unionist your experience will be one of bullying and abuse from nationalists. Thatrsquos how social media bubbles work.The bottom line is that soft No voters, who hold the balance of power in any future referendum, are being deterred from shting their position because of the nastiness of a vocal minority in the Yes movement.Recently, therersquos been a spate of ridiculous and alienating behaviour from some quarters. Jackie Kay, the Makar or national poet, said Scotlandrsquos attitude to race was decades behind England. Kay has a Nigerian father and a Scottish mother. However, with depressing predictability, comments by a woman of colour were written off by white people who wonrsquot accept any criticism of Scotland.These are the people who see reporting facts as ldquorunning down Scotland.

Forsyth tweeted the literary festival Bloody Scotland a joke about Jimmy Krankie. Some independence supporters assumed it was an insult directed at the First Minister. It wasnrsquot.Forsyth was insulted and attacked, as was the BBC. The FM had to put a message out asking people to please leave Forsyth alone.The pro-independence website Wings Over Scotland has floated setting up its own political party. It seems that a signicant minority of Yes supporters see this as a good thing. On social media, the site is known for trolling, abuse and insults.Therersquos a deep confusion and hypocrisy here. The people who support the idea of this new political entity have a long history of viciously attacking anyone who suggested voting for any Yes-supporting party, other than the SNP, at previous Scottish elections. A Green vote was heresy. ldquoBoth votes SNP was their line. Now therersquos a populist alternative in the offing, a form of Scottish nationalism which suits their aggressive tastes, the mantra of ldquoboth votes SNP doesnrsquot matter anymore.The idea that a populist form of nationalism in Scotland will woo much-needed No voters is absurd. The rise of populist nationalism in Scotland will set back every advance so far made.And this takes us to the crux of the problem ndash we now have two competing visions of independence. One comes in the form of politicians like Ms Sturgeon and Patrick Harvie of the Greens. Itrsquos considered, pragmatic, non-threatening it wants to woo opponents. It wants a progressive, fair and equal Scotland, and believes the way to improve the lot of ordinary people is to leave behind the broken Westminster system. The other is Trumpian in nature and thrives on offence rather than persuasion. It wants independence at any cost.To some extent, you could say of the SNP, ldquohell mend them. For years now, the party has allowed this populist fringe to offend and bully. Now the populist fringe is coming for its seats.:Thousands march in support of Scottish independence in Aberdeen with All Under One BannerThe one abiding image of the Yes movement over the last year has been independence marches through towns and cities. The organisation behind the rallies, All Under One Banner, was caught up in internal feuding this summer, which also didnrsquot help the public image of the Yes movement. But more importantly, the marching doesnrsquot help garner new voters. Will waving a Saltire ever persuade a single Unionist to back Scottish independence Genies donrsquot go back into bottles. The only way for the broader Yes movement to protect itself from this growing online wing is to speak up. If people donrsquot speak up then the metastasising populist fringe risks alienating voters who can be wooed and drowning out the voices of the good, decent, majority of independence supporters.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-employee-detained-china","story":"Simon Cheng Man-kit is missing after crossing the border for a business trip, according to local media.According to reports, he was on his way back on a high-speed train when he called his girlfriend and told her he was approaching the border when he lost contact, according to HK. \"Pray for me,\" he added.The Hong Kong Free Presssaid the trade and investment officer at Scottish Development International had attended a business event in Shenzhen, in south-eastern China, on August , but failed to .:Pictures: Hong Kong protestors turn streets in to river of umbrellasA Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: \"We are concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained while ing to Hong Kong from Shenzhen.\"We are providing support to their family and seeking further information from authorities in Guangdong province and Hong Kong.\"The Scottish Government said it was concerned for Mr Chengs welfare and was liaising with the Foreign Office.A spokesman added: \"We are aware of this incident and we are concerned for Mr Chengs welfare.\"We are liaising with the FCO, who are in contact with Mr Chengs family, the authorities in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, and are seeking further information.\"It is understood that although Mr Cheng works for Scottish Development International he is employed by the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong.:K-pop stars back Beijing regime over Hong Kong protestsThe HKFP said that Mr Chengs girlfriend had told news outlet HK that he had planned toto Hong Kong on the same day he left.Mr Cheng is a Hong Kong permanent resident who had studied in Taiwan and the UK and it is not clear whether he held a diplomatic passport or what documents he used to enter China, the HKFP reported."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-independence-supporters-plan-march-edinburgh","story":"Marchers will gather in Holyrood Park before turning south at George IV Bridge to the Meadows.

SNP forecasts of an oil price of - a barrel that would fund independence in , just before the price fell to - a barrel, were similarly not untrue, but just as fancul.No political side is immune from this sort of thing. The one which mysties me, however, is the surety of those who know what the will of the Scottish people is, always has been, and is certain to be. Some of it, to be sure, has been trotted out for years. But itrsquos still often demonstrable nonsense.Take the claim that Scottish political culture has always been dferent and that Westminster bullies a population with dferent priorities.:Nicola Sturgeon: Anti-English nationalists not welcome in SNPHardly anyone seems to acknowledge that until less than ten years ago, Scotlandrsquos votes for the Commons were by and large in line with those of the dominant UK parties Holyrood.For most of the past  years, when wersquove been out of step with the rest of the UK, itrsquos not been by much. Certainly not wildly out of line with the North-East of England, Wales, or Devon and Cornwall. And since Scotland has been at the most about  per cent of the UKrsquos population during that period, is it so very odd that wersquore occasionally on the minority side of a popular vote For ten years before this apparent ergence, we had one of the most powerfully devolved assemblies or parliaments in Europe. Almost all claims that the Scottish Parliament canrsquot do something that doesnrsquot involve foreign policy, nuclear defence or some other UK-wide issue, are . Schools  The NHS  Policing  All entirely devolved.Another myth is that Scotland is fundamentally Socialist and left-of-centre and was written off by Margaret Thatcherrsquos government. That, in recent years, has been accepted as axiomatic but strikes me as odd, given that the collapse in the Tory vote didnrsquot happen under Mrs Thatcher.The popular vote for the Tories went up in  and  but fell really dramatically only after John Major came to power and tanked the economy by trying to join the ERM. Mrs Thatcher certainly lost some votes in Scotland, but is anyone suggesting she had no admirers here  Even now, the Tories attract the second-highest number of votes.Claim three, and the one that those claims rest on, and which the previous examples already prove are silly in the extreme: Scotland has a homogeneous ldquocultural view.When it comes down to it, Irsquom sorry to say, this is dangerously close to racism, even ndash in fact, especially ndash because it cloaks itself in inclusiveness. Scots have a good record in welcoming immigrants from other cultures and these newer Scots make a vigorous and useful contribution to our economy and cultural le.But, under the current dispensation, almost everyone is now to be judged on whether theyrsquore ldquoScottish enough. The SNP is now decrying the Westminster governmentrsquos points-based policy , as ldquoracist ndash which presumably means ldquonot keen enough on the SNP.:Rosemary Goring: Prince Andrew must end his silence on EpsteinSeeing the EU as fundamentally undemocratic, or thinking that UK control of immigrationis, according to the SNP, un-Scottish.This will come as a surprise to many of us. It seems to be an attitude conjured out of thin air and prejudice, rather like the linguistic rule that Scotch applies only to food and drink, and the adjective is otherwise Scots or Scottish. This was invented in the s on no basis whatsoever: it would certainly have baffled Scottish writers like Scott or Buchan.Of course, itrsquos a harmless stylistic preference yoursquore perfectly welcome, and thanks to it now being the norm, probably wise to adopt. But itrsquos not a rule. Applying similarly daft and prejudiced policing of ldquoproper Scottish political thought is a much more outrageous and dangerous proposition."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-super-supper-solution","story":"THE sights you see in Glasgow ... says Tom Rafferty: ldquoThe city has inventive people.

Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The exhibition-on-wheels is travelling around Scotland highlighting the importance of remembrance.\"  Poppyscotland’s ‘Bud’ hits the road to tell the poppy’s storyviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A healthier way to travel...and the government hopes more of us will get back on our bikes or walk for short journeys, rather than taking the car.\"  Have your say on Scotland’s National Transport Strategy viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period.

Warm and sunny conditions in spring and early summer provided excellent growing conditions across most of the country, but the recent spate of torrential rain and flooding has come at a bad time for the industry.In most places the ground has been too waterlogged to allow machinery into fields to cut and crops are likely to need costly drying once they are gathered to preserve the quality of produce.The National Farmers’ UnionScotland says the impact of August’s heavy rainfall is not yet “a disaster”, but has certainly put “a dampener” on planned operations, with workers left watching the skies and waiting for opportunities to get tractors deployed.Members around the country have been reporting some success with winter barley and small amounts of oilseed rape. However, continuing downpours mean harvesting for rape, wheat and spring barley will now have to be squeezed into the next available window of good weather and when ground conditions for machinery improve. Sowing winter crops of rape, wheat and barley may also be delayed, they say.The union said the situation was still “salvageable” and even one “nice week of dry weather” in the next month could be enough to ensure a good harvest.Ian Sands, NFU Scotland’s combinable crops chairman, farms at Balbeggie in Perthshire.He said: “Growers theand breadth of Scotland all seem to be in the same boat as we watch the promise of a very good harvest falter in the wet weather.“Regardless of what crop anyone is trying to harvest, the fields are very soft for travelling across with combines and trailers and, with more rain forecast, this will not improve any time soon.”Neil White, from Greenknowe in Duns, Berwickshire, said: “Harvest is progressing, but at a very slow pace.“Cutting decisions are made by the forecast and the potential deterioration in grain quality rather than moisture.”He added: “It is not all gloomy as the crops cut are good, but remaining ones are deteriorating in the wet and the bulk of the harvest is still to come.”As well as the challenging conditions, uncertainty over the impact of Brexit, particularly in the event of “no-deal”, are also causing anxiety for the agriculture sector.Mr Sands said: “The feared Brexit speculation that prices would fall is not speculation any more – it is a reality.“Hopefully the weather picks up and quick progress can be made through the main part of the harvest and we can get next year’s crops back in the ground in decent conditions.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s selfish and elitist to object to summer sessions concerts geoff ellis","story":"It#s fine to dislike the music of Lewis Capaldi or Tom Jones, but Princes Street Gardens are for all to enjoy # music fans included, writes Geoff Ellis. We are exceptionally lucky to have the support of thousands of music fans, who bought tickets for nine outstanding shows, which included local artists too, during Summer Sessions in Princes Street Gardens. Whilst sales tell us that people love these concerts, we face the inevitable complaints from a few, including Clf Hague of the Cockburn Association in Scotland On Sunday at the weekend.We are all entitled to opinions, but I feel a duty to respond in the interests of fairness and honesty, and to stand up for music lovers in this city. : Princes St gigs mean curtains for common good – Clf HagueAt DF Concerts  Events, we’re all about making incredible cultural experiences accessible to as many people as possible. We’re proud to be at the forefront of the hugely important music scene in Scotland. Our Summer Sessions concerts attract international appeal, bringing , visitors into the Gardens, a third of whom reside in Edinburgh, to enjoy music surrounded by a stunning setting.We understand Clf may personally dislike the music of Lewis Capaldi and Tom Jones, but that doesn’t mean he should deny Edinburgh audiences from seeing them outdoors in their city – which is realistically the alternative. The Gardens are for everyone to enjoy, including music fans. To deny such joys is both selfish and elitist. We received feedback that the experience we offer for accessible customers is magnicent and beyond what is offered by most event organisers. The sarcastic comments regarding Summer Sessions are largely childish. We work with Police Scotland and council officials to ensure safety is maintained throughout. We listened to feedback, installing a retractable curtain to allow full views of the Gardens during the day. A happy medium, in my view. Safety is our only concern with regards to the screening, and the barriers have been placed in front of the benches to prevent anyone climbing railings and risking injury. There is still ample space to walk on the pavements butpeople congregate there, it becomes unsafe. If Clf’s aversion is to ticketed events, I wonderhe appreciates that “free” concerts must still be paid for, presumably as a burden to council tax payers. The city council would lose revenue from renting out the Gardens, which are not free to hire.In fact, the fireworks which Mr Hague approves of may only take place for one night each year, but actually block access to the Gardens for a week beforehand. It begs the question – why isn’t he consistent in his disapproval Furthermore, not that I have any issue with the fantastic event, I’ve never seen criticism from such commentators on the fencing blocking Charlotte Square each year for the Book Festival. Is this one rule for literature and another for rock ‘n’ roll  That hardly seems fair.Eyes from around the world are on Edinburgh during August, and it feels right that locals and visitors can enjoy an iconic music festival as part of the festivities, boosting the atmosphere and civic pride in the city. We’re bringing communities together, and generating hundreds of thousands of pounds for the local economy at the same time. With the images the world sees of our stage beneath the iconic Edinburgh Castle, we are doing our bit to promote the beauty of Edinburgh on an international scale to potential visitors. Perhaps Lords Cockburn and Moncref would have approved!It’s been said that these concerts are Scotland’s Red Rocks equivalent. I would argue that they are even better, and we hope to be back again in !

The poet is right to point out that in , the average Scottish child will be unaware of how Glasgow’s grand cityscape was builton ­proceeds from the slave trade. But neither will they, nor the vast majority of their parents, realise the long-forgotten role one Scots emigrant played in American slavery. I have spent several monthsdeveloping a documentary project about the Hairstons, a fascinating family which, at one point, had one of the largest slaveholdings in the antebellum south. Its historic patriarch, Peter Hairston, was born in ­Dumfries in the twilight of the th century, and became a loyal ­Jacobite. But after the Battle of Preston in , he fled to Ireland before emigrating to the American colonies with his we and five children.They settled in Virginia, where Hairston and his sons secured  acres of fertile land for a tobacco plantation in Goochland County, and a succession of slaves to work it.From that modest holding of the man known nowadays as Peter the Immigrant, an empire grew. Within the space of three generations, the Hairstons came to own around , slaves across  plantations spanning four southern states. The wealth they accrued was ­dizzying. An  edition of the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser newspaper declared Samuel Hairston – Peter’s great grandson – to be the “richest man in Virginia”. A census showed he owned between , and , slaves, and with plantations across Virginia and North Carolina, it is estimated he was worth as much as million. These are familiar traits of the Hairston story – fortunes forged on the back of human misery, ­preserved by rape, coercion, and concubinage, and recorded in meticulous detail in ledger books referencing the dollar value of each man, woman, and child.Yet the narrative is altogether more complex in places, such as the story of Samuel’s brother, Robert, who had secured his own sprawling plantation estate by the time he lay on his deathbed in . One of his final acts was to rewrite his will toemancipate his only child, a slave girl called Chrillis, and leave her his entire fortune. But in a country on the verge ofwar, such a bequest could never stand. The courts denied Chrillis her inheritance and her freedom. Such stories are extraordinary but not exceptional. Countless slave children were given the family name and, in time, formed clans of their own.Not all found brighter futures. One of the family’s most prominent ­living members, Ever Lee Hairston, was born on Cooleemee, a North Carolina plantation where the Hairstons had once enslaved  people. Many,not all, left after abolition. Those who stayed included Ever Lee’s house servant grandparents. Their children did likewise, working as sharecroppers. Even though the Civil War had ended nearly a century previously, Ever Lee was expected to follow suit when she was born in . She spent her early years picking cotton and sleeping in an old slave cabin, before fleeing as a teenager, having realised her family had been ­effectively brainwashed.The youngest generation of Hairstons share her determination to provide a warts and all account of the past. Princess Hairston, an Emmy-nominated film editor from New York, is working on a film about the white and black descendants of Peter the Immigrant. She hopes in time to screen the completed feature in Dumfries. That is, after all, where the story began, and the family’s Scottish roots have long provided its white lineage with a conveniently innocuous backstory. “A lot of white Hairstons weren’t told the family history about how they were one of the biggest slaveowners,” ­Princess told me. “The Scottish heritage became something they ­emphasised to look at their past in a dferent way.”None of these hard truths would have been realised were it not for the prodigious research of Henry Wiencek, who wrote a spellbinding  history of the family, and Peter Wilson Hairston, the sixth generation owner of Cooleemee and a former Superior Court judge. Before his death in  at the age of , he availed himself of the sprawling Hairston archives, ­compiling a history which shone a light on dark places and secured a rapprochement between two families who, through slavery, were one.Earlier this month, the National Hairston Clan held its th annual reunion, with its members ­gathering at Cooleemee, where their descendants once toiled, ­suffered, and often against their will, ensured the continuance of an astonishing legacy. Very few people in the Hairstons’ ancestral homeland will be aware of their story, butthey have found the strength to overcome the lies, mythmaking and silence that for so long obscured the truth, we in Scotland should draw inspiration and ensure we too ask ourselves some searching questions, no matter how uncomfortable the answers. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"parents share update on fate of boy 6 who fell five storeys from tate modern","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The child, who was visiting from France, suffered injuries including a brain bleed and spinal, leg and arm fractures after being allegedly thrown by a -year-old boy from a th-floor viewing  at the art gallery on August .His parents issued a statement to the organiser of a fundraising page set up on their behalf which has received donations of almost £,.They said: \"Our son has already undergone two long and dficult operations. - Mice droppings and mould found at Michelin-starred The Kitchin in Edinburgh\"He is stabilised, but we still do not know the full extent and severity of his injuries.

The building looks superb and anyone I’ve been talking to is pleased the building wasn’t left empty.“I would pay tribute to the owners for investing in Dromore their local town, and wish them all the success over the years. “This kind of venture breeds confidence so hopefully this will create a domino effect and others will follow their example.”, Julie  Leah Mortiboy , Russell Eastwood  Paul Donnelly , Pauline Skeltonand Steven Laveryand Environmental Education Officer Caroline Magill.Picture: Edward Byrne Photography\"  , Julie  Leah Mortiboy , Russell Eastwood  Paul Donnelly , Pauline Skeltonand Steven Laveryand Environmental Education Officer Caroline Magill.Picture: Edward Byrne Photography\"  Council tackles issue of single-use plastics Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"people  ","story":"A Co Down man is seeking the help of News Letter readers in adding some elusive historical items to his growing collection.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these. In particular, the Crystal Mineral Water company in Banbridge produced some fantastic stoneware bottles and it would be the pinnacle of my collection to add one of these.” The bottle from the Crystal Mineral Company in Banbridge that Neil would love to add to his collectionExplaining the history of stoneware bottles, he said: “They were produced during the Victorian era, late s, early s, and were all hand made. No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there. I have a fantastic photo of my grandmother working in the mill taken during the Coronation in . I am seeking anything relating to the mill and its history such as receipts, packaging or advertising or even furniture.”Neil commented: “I am part of a local history group, who meet regularly to discuss past events and places and we regularly showcase items so that they can be shared by all.“I would really love to put on an exhibition in Banbridge and that’s probably where this is going.”Open Day raises over £, Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Sadly Neil’s we Kate doesn’t share his enthusiasm for artefacts from the past: “She thinks it’s a load of junk, she’s a minimalist.”If you can help Neil add to his collection email him at neilreid@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed the 20 ni sights on lonely planet s ultimate uk travel guide","story":"The Giant#s Causeway has been ranked as the UK#s third best tourist destination by respected travel guide Lonely Planet, finishing ahead of attractions such as Hadrian#s Wall and London#s Tate Modern art gallery.For the first time Lonely Planet has picked its  most unmissable experiences and hidden gems across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands to form its ultimate UK travel hitlist.Titanic Belfast was also ranked in the top  UK destinations by Lonely PlanetIn total,  sights and experiences in Northern Ireland feature in the list which was unveiled today, including the Crown Liquor Saloon in Belfast, Rathlin Island and Londonderry’s walls.Out of the score of attractions only one is in Co Armagh , while none of the sights in Co Tyrone feature in the Lonely Planet must see list.Welcoming the news, Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “The inclusion of  Northern Ireland experiences and attractions – including the Giant’s Causeway at number three – in Lonely Planet’s ‘Ultimate UK Travelist’ is good news and will surely help to inspire GB travellers to put Northern Ireland on their holiday wish-list. “It is another well-deserved accolade for all of these attractions, which provides Tourism Ireland with a great hook to continue to promote Northern Ireland as a ‘must visit’ destination.”Lonely Planet’s VP of Experience, Tom Hall, said: “Lonely Planet’s Ultimate United Kingdom Travelist brings together the UK’s most compelling sights and experiences, ranging from world-class museums and giant cathedrals to rollicking festivals, inky lochs and tiny pubs. “We’re thrilled to name the Giant’s Causeway one of the UK’s very best sights - alongside many other wonderful experiences in Northern Ireland including spotting puffins and seals on Rathlin Island and riding a boat through Co Fermanagh’s Marble Arch Caves.”Giant’s Causeway is described by Lonely Planet as “timeless” and “unrepeatable” and is beaten only by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and London’s British Museum.The Ultimate UK Travelist is available at a cost of £..

speaks on his","story":"THE mother of -year-old Gerald McAuley who was shot dead by a loyalist gunman in August  says she has never felt any hatred towards the man who took her son’s le. While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"youve got to love lunch at the lansdowne","story":"IN recent weeks, the North Belfast News has covered much that the brand new Lansdowne Hotel on the Antrim Road has to offer.Back in the day, the establishment was the place to go and thanks to a recent refurbishment, its new owners are hoping to restore its glory days. From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart.

has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit

in the Irish Sea\" and would rather Northern Ireland remained more closely aligned with the EU than Great Britain.Some .% said they would reject the compromise, while .% said they did not know.Within the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its

But Linfield chiefs feel that -they reach the group stages of the Europa League - their team will need an extra day to recover from their Thursday night fixture before playing again.Hence the proposal to move Saturday games to Sundays, despite the long-standing Never On A Sunday rule in its constitution.Mr McGivern said: \"To reach the group stages would be huge for the club and many things need to be taken into consideration.\"We will have extra games - and that will have an impact in terms of scheduling our league matches.\"We cant play home games at Windsor Park on a Sunday because of a club rule. \"Will we have to change that  Probably, but our members will decide that.\"Linfield can play away on a Sunday but there must be a rule change for a home fixture.\"We will be a few games behind other sides and thats the price for being successful in Europe.\"The whole image of the club will be lted and theres obvious financial benefits.\"However, possible change to the clubs constitution has been criticised by North Antrim MLA Mr Allister. \"I think it will be a retrograde step,\" Mr Allister said.\"Theyve had that rule for a very long time. \"To use the exigency of this present situation as an excuse for changing it permanently I think would be inappropriate - and out of keeping with the culture and tradition of Irish League football.\"The ban on Sunday football matches was lted by the Irish Football Association only in , despite protests from the DUP and evangelical campaigners, including the Free Presbyterian Church.The first match held on a Sunday since the ban was lted was an Irish Premiership match between Glentoran and Bangor at The Oval in Belfast.See back page for full story"},{"url":null,"title":"bombay streets burning by loyalists 50 years ago remembered in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I make a reference to my go-to sound engineer  Gerry Craig  being a past pupil and so continues a ream of well-known characters in the local and national music scene who are former students of MAPA including  Roe, Ports, Soak, Touts, Balkan Alien Sound, Cherym, Sugarwolf, New Pagans  and  Foreign Owl. Grainne  continues that “once past levels  and  there are pathways for students to continue performing or to get into the technological side of the arts after which students do a HNC or HND which they can then top up to full honours degree at Leeds Beckett, Leeds College of Music or Paisley. A bit like in a video game.

That sounds magic to me. The department maintains links with festivals which offer performance production opportunities including Stendhal and Celtronic. Students also participate annually in BBC introducingas well as ious shows and gigs throughout the year in venues around town culminating in the MAPA showcase which includes live performances of both music and dance as well as recorded pieces. “The space is versatile and state of the art”  Grainne  tells me “the theatre can adapt to accommodate band, theatre and dance performances, there are sound-proofed practice rooms, two recording studios and three computer suites of Mac computers with up-to-date software” which conjures up the image of the perfect environment to satisfy the most creative of minds out there.

They also claimed that the deceased Creggan man suffered further injuries as he fell to the ground on a laneway outside St Marys Church in the estate.However, Seamus Bradleys family repeatedly maintained that he died later having been taken away from the scene in an army saracen and sustained fatal injuries whilst being subjected to torture during interrogation.The Coroner, Judge Patrick Kinney, however ruled out both versions of the events at Laganside Court in Belfast last Thursday . The judge said he was satisfied that Seamus Bradley was killed by a soldier who got out of a Saracen, fell to one knee and opened fire, but added that he had been unable to identy the soldier responsible for the shooting.“He was running across an open area of ground, he had no weapon and he was clearly visible,” Mr Kinney said.The Coroner also concluded that the deceased man could not have reasonably been percieved as posing a threat of death or serious injury to the soldiers in the Army vehicle nor to anyone  and that the use of force by the soldier was “entirely disproportionate to any threat that could have been perceived.”Furthermore, Mr Kinney said, there was no first aid or medical assistance provided by the soldiers, butit had been there was a “reasonable prospect” that Seamus Bradley would have survived. The judge also concluded the victim was not mistreated by British Army personnel in the Saracen either by physical assault, torture or shooting.Seamus Bradleys brother Danny who has pursued the case for decades told the Derry News: “First of all I would like to make a statement referring to my brothers first inquest in . The prosecution showed a black and white picture to the jury and then turned to my father and called him a liar and said your son was not tortured.“This same man was aware that there were coloured pictures showing that Seamus neck was badly marked and which the black and white images failed to show.“Seamus was stripped naked and badly beaten about the face and shot three times at close range. At the original inquest one soldier claimed that Seamus fell out of the Saracen onto his face, but the army medical officer said that never happened.“Sadly, the police at the time did not show the Bradley family any of the pictures and it took to  for the police to show nine black and white pictures. Then in  the Coroners office showed us  coloured pictures. It can be safely be said that both the black and white and coloured pictures went missing to save the security forces embarrassment.”Danny Bradley also told the Derry News: “I have mixed emotions but I achieved what I set out to do. That was to clear Seamus name and thats what matters. Its not about me.”“I also intend to send the Inquest report to the Irish Government as well as the independent ballistics report because this was a war crime. My brother was a soldier, a volunteer in the Provisional IRA. His papers were logged under war file by the British Government and they have broken the Geneva Convention becuase they had declared war on the IRA.“By doing so they must take responsibility for and due care of their prisoners and I will be asking for a proper investigation-something which the state failed to deliver in .”In  the former Historical Enquiries Team in their examination of the Bradley case concluded that the British Army,they were telling the truth, had acted lawfully with respect to his killing, but added that the death had never been “effectively investigated.”Sinn Féin MLA Raymond McCartney Justice Spokesman welcomed the Coroners Court decision and said: “The Bradley family have been campaigning for the truth about what happened to Seamus for many years. All families bereaved by the conflict are entitled to access to the truth about the deaths of their loved ones.“We need to see the British Government implementing the legacy mechanisms agreed at Stormont House so that families and campaigners can get access to the truth.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCAPTION: -year-old IRA volunteer Seamus Bradley."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland society dealt decade anniversaries commemorations","story":"This week’s th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bogside comes in the midst of a decade of anniversaries of many of the seminal events in recent Irish history. Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"strength community shown newtown mayoral visits","story":"Newtown Mayor Cllr David Selby with members of the Men#s Shed\" Strength of community shown in mayoral visitsThe fire cadets in Newtown.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod man mike complete last ever six marathons birthday","story":"Mike Hodges with one of previous marathon medals.

He brushed aside two weak challenges in the YC box before firing past Carberry.Within less than a minute it was -.A superb run and cross from Rice was laid off by Neale to the onrushing Thomas Healy and he steered the ball into the corner of Walshrsquos net for his first goal for Killyleagh.Killyleagh were struggling to deal with Olympicrsquos pace in attack, with Molloy in particular causing problems and it took a fine save from Carberry in the th minute to keep out the wingerrsquos curling shot.From the resultant corner Olympicrsquos two big central defenders combined, with Paul Dickson outjumping Macaulay Foster to head back for Jason Noade to head in and make it -.The second half was only four minutes old when Olympic had strong penalty appeals waved away by the referee when McClean went down in the box under a challenge from McConnell.Two goals inside two minutes shortly after the hour mark seemed to have killed the game.Nathan Jones was having his best ever game at The Showgrounds with Killyleagh struggling to cope with his pace when he switched to the left wing in the second half.When he was left one on one with YC sweeper Niall Walsh in the st minute he put on the after burners and delivered a beauty of a finish past Carberry.Ballynahinchrsquos fourth goal, two minutes later, was stunning. A superb team goal passing across the fullof the pitch, orchestrated by Stephen Noade and involving Jones, ended in a YC defender putting into his own net.Killyleagh, though, refused to throw the towel in and when their stand-out player, Rice, yet again exposed a vulnerability on the flanks, his inch-perfect cross was bravely turned in by Neale in the th minute.This was the spark for Killyleaghrsquos best spell of the game with Rice giving width and McConnell the creator and Jamie Sharvin linking up play.Walsh somehow kept out with his feet Jamie Sharvinrsquos nd minute effort from Healyrsquos pass and then three minutes later he gratefully ped on Jamie Sharvinrsquos close range shot under pressure from another Rice cross.The big crowd was getting value for the entrance fee now and Walsh underlined his Amateur League representative reputation by producing a supering save from Ricersquos cross to cut out the danger in the th minute.Olympic were content to hit on the break by this stage and substitute Aaron McClean went close with a header before the visitors delivered the ultimate sucker punch.A stunning pass from deep allowed Jones to race through and Dalton Tate delivered the finish in the nd minute.But still the game wasnrsquot finished. Rice powered down the line yet again and once more producing a teasing cross which Neale thumped in.It was now -. At the opposite end Shane Murray blasted over the bar when he was played through by Jones and then Killyleagh thought they had pulled it back to - to set up a grandstand finish when Nealersquos shot was spilled and Dylan Kelly rled home, but the referee ruled he had been in an offside position when the initial shot was delivered.No one was leaving early and at this rate, there will be plenty looking to book their place for thematch later in the season.By then, Olympic will hope they have further underscored that they are the team best equipped this season to challenge Crumlin Starrsquos stranglehold on the premier title..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sharon stars on Angela’s day  ","story":"LADY luck shone down on Angela Kenmore for her Lady Captainrsquos Day at St Patrickrsquos Golf Club on Saturday.A welcome window in the weather meant that the ladies escaped the dayrsquos frequent deluges and almost miraculously went round rain free.Heavy showers early in the morning had put the competition under threat and the afternoon downpours meant that Mrs Kenmorersquos male guests got a soaking.But not aof rain fell on the ladies, who also had the benefit of not having to play out of the water-logged bunkers.Despite the weather prediction, there was a great turnout and a thrilling finish.Sharon Heaney and Anne Teggart finished tied at the top of the leaderboard with  points, but it was Sharon who took the Lady Captainrsquos prize thanks to a better back nine.With Anne having to settle for the runners-up spot, third place went to Patricia McCormick, who came in with  points.The prize for the best gross went to Caitlin Burke who beat Twyla Gibson on the better back nine after they both ed a score of .The front nine prize went to Mary Rice with  points and Orlagh Carson won the back nine prize with  points.Anne Savage won the past lady captainsrsquo prize with  points and Alison Rooney won the committee prize with  points.Nearest the pin prizes were won by Margaret Willis , Caitlin Burke , Jackie Elliottand Patricia McCormick .Gerry Gray won the lady guestsrsquo prize with  points and Brendan Mullen won the male guestsrsquo prize with  points.The Lady Captainrsquos mixed greensomes competition on Thursday was won by vice-captain Robert McCausland and past lady captain Eileen Mullen with  points mdash one point better than runners-up Ryan Teggart and Carmel Hanvey.Nearest the pin prizes were won by Anne Tumeltyand John Passmore ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Taking porridge and exercise are Roddy’s secrets to long life  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new centenarian, Roderick Maguire, says his secret to a long le is his daily bowl of porridge.The former master painter says he still has porridge every morning which he makes for himself at his Thomas Russell Park home.Mr Maguire, better known as Roddy, turned  nearly two weeks ago on August .He received the customary congratulatory card from the Queen as well as a letter from Irish President Michael DHiggins and euro, mdash a special financial bounty known as the Centenarian award.Mr Maguire was treated to a special reception in St Patrickrsquos Church after parish priest Fr John Murray said a special mass for him on his birthday.His family gathered at Quoile Bistro the next night to have a family reunion, which included children and grandchildren who travelled over from Doncaster in England.With his first we Betty, who sadly died many years ago, he had four children mdash Rory, Joan, Anne and Niall.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome.

They can also be a risk to emergency services.Some  Vale properties have been empty for more than  years, but most long-term empty properties are vacant for six months to two years.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

has joined forces with Councils in Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.

The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of .

Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing.
