[{"url":null,"title":"Monty Don says fond farewell adorable four legged TV star Nigel captivated viewers","story":" They say that certain film stars ‘stick to the lens’, always being the most interesting, attractive thing in a shot, regardless of what they or anyone else is doing or saying. Nigel is just like that.He can also very quickly learn simple things like when to come, where to walk and when to quietly lie down.Nothing that a million other dogs couldn’t do just as well, but very few would do them so reliably, time after time, among the slightly chaotic, crowded circumstances of a TV shoot.Although Gardeners’ World is carefully edited to appear as an easy, natural flow of action, the reality of filming is anything but that. Every action and every word will have to be repeated at least two or three times, and often as many as seven or eight.This means Nigel also has to repeat every action half a dozen times at exactly the right moment — often with mind-numbingly slow minutes between takes. And he does this with astonishing compliance.I do have a potent incentive: a small yellow tennis ball in my pocket that, critically, has a squeak. So when asked if he can look in my direction while I’m speaking rather than making eyes at the crew — Nigel is a terrible flirt — I’ll give the ball a quick squeak just as the director says: ‘Action!’Nigel, terribly excited by this, then spends the rest of the take looking across to see where the noise and glorious hint of tennis ball aroma is coming from.He has remained an unusually talkative dog, with noises that are friendly, varied and very, very frequent.One of his specialities is a long sobbing welcome. The more surprised he is to see you, the more vocal he becomes, with a welcoming bark in these situations that amounts to a shout. Sometimes, he goes off to spend the day farming with my son. And if I then go over myself and he discovers me in the farmyard, Nigel greets me as though I’ve returned from walking across the Arctic.What? You! Here? Why, hello! What an unbelievable coincidence! To stumble across each other in this place, on this day, at this time. Amazing!Another thing about Nigel is that he smiles a lot. Not the crinkly, toothy, squinty-eyed grin that some dogs produce when they see you — which is not really a smile at all, but a submissive gesture — but the relaxed, slack-mouthed beam of someone pleased with their lot.This has nothing to do with other dogs or people, but often has a lot to do with a stick or ball that is now between his front paws, ready for the next match of fun. Life at that point is very, very good.So Nigel beams, the corners of his mouth high, his tongue out, his eyes soft and shining and his tail wagging. At times like this, he radiates goodwill and simple pleasure, which has the desired effect of provoking greater happiness in me by playing with him.I feel happier seeing him he feels tremendously happy — we’re all thoroughly cheered up.I think that this is an important reason why we love our dogs. We get visible and straightforward feedback from them when we do something to please them.There are no strings attached, no complications or trade-offs, no debts accruing or owing, no judgment of any kind made.You throw a ball or scratch an ear and the dog likes it and lets you know. That’s it.Nigel also likes to sit on my lap when I’m in an armchair by the fire, and will climb up in a manner that I suspect he regards as stealthy but is, in fact, just insistent.Once balanced on my knees, he sinks into a deep and heavy-limbed sleep that leaves me quite unable to read my book, let alone reach for the glass that is tantalisingly close to hand, were it not for 70lb of Nigel pinning me to the chair.I do believe that dogs can truly love their owners.But I always feel deeply uncomfortable when owners talk about their pets as though they were human, because this seems to diminish the relationship, rather than enhance it. I often look at Nigel, and think what an extraordinary thing it is to have this large animal sharing the house with us, and how dependent that relationship is upon him choosing to go along with it rather than me enforcing it.This seems to me much more mysterious and wonderful than acting as though he’s simply a four-footed human."},{"url":null,"title":"Dutch government advises singletons looking intimacy come agreement regular partner","story":"Share this articleCoronavirus: Dutch singletons advised to seek ‘sex buddy’ - BBC News"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee8cf0a0ee50d839de5501a8946e702da9a75851/3_222_3653_2192/master/3653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7091558deef17308b620868003fe98ef","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Physical distancing, lockdown and protests about the death of Ahmaud Arbery – the most striking photographs from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1befca8f40f7f6b3ed3fa1eaf1d7e41f7a50a4b/0_320_7195_4315/master/7195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2428085e7ed3498209b673f2085ef33","title":"park and recreation in pictures","story":"Photographer Suki Dhanda captures the early morning beauty of London’s Hackney Marshes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49ec8bcb46385bafd10008b8623b81b0c0804887/0_0_1654_2339/master/1654.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=40ca8b5e9ff7f9abf93ba75e5c216380 1760w","title":"dara mcanulty nature writing diary of a young naturalist","story":"Dara McAnulty is being hailed by the likes of Robert Macfarlane and Chris Packham as a bright new voice. He talks about life with autism and finding peace in the wilds of Northern IrelandIt is a challenging time to be 16 and, like his peers, Dara McAnulty must currently endure a form of house arrest that means no seeing friends, no GCSEs. Unlike other locked-down teens, McAnulty is also dealing with the harsh mischance of having his first book, Diary of a Young Naturalist, published during the coronavirus crisis. He was supposed to be touring festivals but every date is cancelled. “I feel like my being is suffering from a slow puncture,” McAnulty tweeted in March. “I honestly feel like my world is falling apart right now.”When we meet via a video call a month later, his mood has lifted. Lockdown is tough. His mum, Róisín – who McAnulty likes to have by his side, discreetly, during interviews – contracted coronavirus quite severely meanwhile, he feels “trapped” and is “bouncing around the house like a ping pong ball”. Mercifully, over the road from their modern housing estate is a wood where he takes his daily exercise. “If I didn’t have it, I would be utterly insane,” he says. “The ground there is alive with peacock butterflies”, and that morning, he saw a red squirrel “so that makes the day”, he grins.There is a genuine buzz around his debut, a combination of nature book and memoir, a warm portrait of a close-knit family and a coming-of-age story. Robert Macfarlane has hailed his “extraordinary voice and vision” Chris Packham has become a friend Steve Silberman, author of NeuroTribes, called him “inspiring”. The teenager’s environmental activism has led to comparisons with Greta Thunberg.McAnulty is autistic, and it would be easy to file his book alongside Packham’s Fingers in the Sparkle Jar which gave a vivid insight into the naturalist’s Asperger’s but Dara has his own style. Simple, gorgeous sentences unfurl, one after another. Of a hot summer’s day, he writes: “Dragonflies are whizzing, grasshoppers are trembling in the grass, and swallows are everywhere.” Or: “The valley sings, heaves and rests.” There are original, imaginative descriptions too – caterpillars move “like slow-motion accordions” and a goshawk chick looks “like an autumn forest rolled in the first snows of winter”.He lives with his dad, Paul, mum and younger siblings, Lorcan and Bláthnaid, in a small rented three-bedroom house in Castlewellan, Northern Ireland. As a young child, Dara loved to bang on about black holes to anyone who would listen, and was diagnosed as autistic when he was five. In fact, Róisín, Lorcan and Bláthnaid are also autistic only Paul, a conservation scientist, is not. The teenager describes his family as “as close as otters”. They are also punk lovers, chaotic and “pretty formidable, apparently”.McAnulty exudes energy and laughs a lot. His voice, however, belongs to an older man, and his writing is often unexpectedly wise too. When I ask about literary inspiration, he answers immediately: Seamus Heaney. “You can reread his poems again and again” there are “all these different compartments like bubbles. You pop them one at a time and there’s no centre to it. There’s this saying about a brain: if a brain was simple enough to understand, we’d be too stupid to understand that brain. That’s almost the same as Seamus Heaney’s poems because they have such complex connections.”He also enjoys reading Ursula K Le Guin, is currently “neck-deep” in his umpteenth rereading of The Lord of the Rings, and is fond of Agatha Christie for her focus on people’s hidden motives. “That’s been quite important to me because I try my best to learn about humans so I can make acceptable social interactions.”A teacher once told McAnulty he would never be able to string a paragraph together. He was miserable – “and miserable is an understatement” – at a succession of schools, including Oscar Wilde’s alma mater, Portora. The bullying (he didn’t know how to make small talk about Minecraft) intensified as he became a teenager. The noise and clutter of classrooms made them the worst environment for him.McAnulty learned that being in nature helped. “I can’t speak for all autistic people, but I feel things more intensely. In a shopping centre there’s all of those different noises coming from different angles – my brain can’t process them quickly enough, and everything goes completely crazy. Being out in nature, the sounds are quite level and I find it easier with muted colours. Everything just works. It’s not oppressive.”He wrote from a young age, on scraps of paper. “One of my ways of processing the world is writing things down,” he says. Then social media helped him find a path. Aged 12, he began a blog about nature and joined Twitter. “Four years ago I wouldn’t have been able to talk to you right now,” he says. “Twitter opened my world to like-minded people. You’ll always find someone who is willing to talk to you about mycelial networks. It’s given me so many opportunities to connect with people and not feel so isolated.”As McAnulty wrote, and also took his first steps in environmental activism – campaigning to end the persecution of birds of prey – his blog gained readers and admirers. Three years ago, he appeared on Springwatch and was befriended by Packham. Adrian Cooper and Gracie Burnett, the husband-and-wife team behind tiny independent publisher Little Toller spotted his writing and began talking to his family about a book.Diary of a Young Naturalist tells the story of McAnulty’s year from spring equinox to spring equinox, from his 14th to 15th birthday. It was a difficult time. His family moved from one side of Northern Ireland to the other and he had to cope with changing schools and losing his cherished wild heartlands, a forest called Big Dog. “When I was younger, I remember moving from a school I absolutely hated. Even though I wanted to get out of that place with every single fibre of my body, still, in the back of my mind, I was going: ‘I don’t want change.’”The move from Big Dog precipitated a breakdown, where McAnulty ended up screaming in panic in his garden. His struggles that summer were not helped by the rise of social media trolling (the downside of forging those positive connections). “Removing” himself from Big Dog “was devastating, as if it killed a part of me. Then I went up into the Mournes” – the mountain range close to his new home – “and everything became fine again.” Was his recovery as simple as that? “No, but it definitely helped discovering a new place and building up a new connection with the land. I slowly crawled my way back into some semblance of a calm state of mind. Exploring was a really big part of that, trying to find new places to root myself.”Writing was followed by a seven-month edit with Cooper and his parents. “All my family got together, trying to coax this book into something that was manageable,” says McAnulty. But Róisín says she wouldn’t want people to think his writing was overly shaped by others. “Although it has been edited sensitively and beautifully, the first draft was actually incredible.” Rewriting was a mixed blessing for McAnulty, forcing him to “re-experience” memories both traumatic and joyful. “I uncovered things about myself along the way. It’s like reading a book for the second time. I had to drag myself back through that thornbush. But I understood myself all the better because of it.”After his breakdown, he started at a new school. Despite huge anxiety, in the book he finds kindred souls and a nurturing environment. “It has been the best school I’ve had,” he says. He still has to flee lessons at times but “I have, dare I say it, friends now, for the first time ever. I’ve had the best luck in the world … I managed to land myself in a year group that was basically made up of nerds.”In the meantime, McAnulty keeps his family, and the simple glories of the natural world, close. His favourite time is dusk, when “the night sky seems to chase the sun out of the sky and you can’t really see the sun’s light but you know it’s just underneath the horizon,” he says. “At that time, the energy in the air is so charged. That’s when the bats begin to come out, and you feel such a rush.”• Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Toller (RRP £16). To order a copy go to bookshop.

Without buyers and sellers alike booking removal lorries and moving home, large parts of the economy can lose momentum and drag on growth.The decision to allow property viewings as part of an easing of the lockdown was seen by ministers as a much-needed boost to commercial life. Over the coming months retailers and wholesalers that supply kitchens, carpets and light fittings will join the army of previously furloughed estate agents in getting a boost.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to forecasting group the EY Item Club, describes the move as “relief for the housing market” that “should allow activity to progressively pick up” over the coming months.A better outcome – one that leads to a stronger rebound – is unlikely, he says. The anxiety surrounding the path of the coronavirus pandemic, and the prospect of thousands of businesses going bust and millions of people becoming unemployed, will keep a lid on the recovery.“Some people have already lost their jobs, despite the supportive government measures, while others may be worried that they could still end up losing their job once the furlough scheme ends,” he says. “Additionally, many incomes have been negatively affected. Consumer confidence is currently at or near record low levels on many measures, and many people are likely to remain cautious for some time to come with regards to making major spending decisions such as buying or moving house.”Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), says: “I suspect people will be fairly wary.”He adds that while the easing of restrictions will unlock transactions already in the pipeline and encourage those who need to move for work or family reasons, most people will wait to see how their circumstances develop before buying.“They don’t know where prices are going to be at the end of the year and whether they will be in negative equity,” he says.Rubinsohn says buyers have also found they may want to consider aspects of a property that were not so important three months ago.“They might want to put a garden or balcony higher up their agenda, or put more time into considering the merits of city life versus something more rural,” he says.“I am not sure we are able to make judgments about which way people are going to jump. It is too early to say. But there is certainly the potential for people to rethink what they want from their next home.”Trends that were developing before the pandemic hit could be accelerated as the lockdown eases. If commercial properties become less attractive to employers following a shift to home working, a trend to convert empty offices into apartments could pick up pace.Rubinsohn warns that this may not be good news for buyers after a report by academics at University College London for Rics found developers had taken the opportunity of weak planning rules to produce substandard homes that one critic dubbed “the slums of the future”.Other trends could reverse. A drift to the city could come to an abrupt end as the prospect of rejoining the morning commuter crush loses its appeal. And the hollowing-out of town centre high streets could be turned around if the prospect of queuing at an out-of-town supermarket is tarnished and buying from local shops is seen as safer.The promise of historically low interest rates for the next two years – and most likely a decade or more – could underpin this transition, but the route back to a more normal level of transactions will be slow.Rubinsohn argues that the government will need to consider tax breaks or subsidies to kickstart the market before housebuilders consider limiting the supply of new homes further.“Without help, and especially as unemployment increases, the housing market recovery is going to be slow. It will be a hard slog,” he says.The buyersEd Fireman, 54, and his wife Sue, 53, were raring to go when the property market reopened on Wednesday. The couple, who live near Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, had an offer accepted on a new home nearby during lockdown, based on a virtual viewing, and were keen to get their place on the market. “We were straight on the phone to the estate agent – let’s get moving. But we also have feeling of trepidation because people are talking about a crash,” he says. He has a provisional valuation for his house, based on a video tour he’d given the agent, but she is coming to see it. “We are talking to her about how this will work – and what will happen if someone wants to come in.”They have seen the house they are buying in real-life now and are very happy. “I think it was the right thing to make an offer when no one else was looking. If there’s a massive crash and we end up having exchanged on it and can’t find a buyer for this one, that will be a problem.”The sellerTess Butler, 46, started to try to sell her home in Warminster, Wiltshire, in July last year. She wants to move to nearby Salisbury, where her autistic daughter is at school. “We had quite a few people through the doors but all I was hearing from the agents was ‘we need to see what’s happening with the Brexit date’,” she says. Several months, and two estate agents later, things looked better. “This was in mid-February. My new agent said the market was picking up – they’d sold 14 houses in a week.” But then came lockdown.Butler works in the tech industry and was keen to offer virtual tours, but her estate agent put staff on furlough and is still closed. She is ready to do viewings, but says agents everywhere will have to manage expectations, given the domestic challenges posed by lockdown: “Like other people we have been properly living in the house for the past couple of months.” And prices are a concern. “I’m selling in an area where prices may go down, and moving somewhere where I don’t think they will.”The estate agentTom Floyd, 33, is sales manager at the Kennington branch of Winkworth in south London. He was doing an online quiz when news that firms could reopen started to filter through “and my phone went mad”. Some staff were furloughed, but he has worked throughout – fielding calls and registering buyers.“We’ve now been contacting those people to arrange viewings,” he says, and appointments will begin on Monday. Staff have PPE and everyone involved must declare they are healthy and have not been exposed to the virus. “I’m not too worried, and we have spoken to staff to check they are all happy. We reserve the right to refuse viewings if we are concerned.”Many of the deals arranged before lockdown are still on and discounts have been small. “Where we’ve lost deals is where people have pulled out completely,” Floyd says. “Some have been first-time buyers and they have been furloughed or seen redundancies at work.” Hilary Osborne"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a7a07d0b2b9e4484a67494d451c0cea45b377dd/0_165_3886_2332/master/3886.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8840b2274ff08e47206efb3e6540da1c","title":"are we all in this together it doesnt look like it from the regions","story":"Forget ‘levelling up’, Boris Johnson has reverted to London-centric type in ignoring how coronavirus measures affect the rest of BritainTwo weeks ago, I joined the eight other English regional mayors on a phone call with the prime minister. As a former mayor himself, Boris Johnson gets where we’re coming from. Over the best part of an hour, we had a friendly discussion about the release from lockdown and the need for the regions to be empowered to lead recovery within a national framework.I took the opportunity to repeat a call for a safety-led approach to any release. But I also made a point of saying how important it was for us all to preserve a sense of national unity. We wanted to continue work in that way, but given the complexity of what lay ahead, that would mean being properly involved in what comes next.When I listened to the PM make his announcement last Sunday – and observing the government’s behaviour this week – it has felt as though it had decided to do the polar opposite of what I was asking. Life has changed and, suddenly, everything feels very fractious.In Greater Manchester, we had no real notice of the measures. On the eve of a new working week, the PM was on TV “actively encouraging” a return to work. Even though that would clearly put more cars on roads and people on trams, no one in government thought it important to tell the cities that would have to cope with that.Far from a planned, safety-led approach, this looked like another exercise in Cummings chaos theory.But it wasn’t just the lack of notice that was the problem. The surprisingly permissive package might well be right for the southeast, given the fall in cases there. But my gut feeling told me it was too soon for the north. Certainly, the abrupt dropping of the clear “stay at home” message felt premature.If the government had taken us through their reasoning, perhaps we could have been reassured. But this brings me to a recurrent problem throughout the crisis. The mayor of London is on Cobra, and rightly so. But there is no place for any mayors from the north, or indeed the rest, of England.For a government elected on votes in the north, and promises to “level-up”, it is surprising how quickly it has reverted to the default, London-centric mode in this crisis. Last Sunday’s package certainly felt more suited to the south than to the north.And the same pattern continued into the week. On Thursday, a £1.6bn funding package was agreed for Transport for London. I don’t have a problem with that. But where was the deal for Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham?Like London’s Tube, our tram system has seen an increase in passengers this week. But we are running a skeleton, 20-minute service and are not even fully funded to do that. If you are encouraging a return to work, surely any safety-led approach would require you to help cities fund extra trams to allow for social distancing? Simply telling people to drive doesn’t work for the third of people here who don’t own a car.It’s not just on transport where the government is not reading the room. At the start of the crisis, the message to councils was, “spend what you need to keep people safe, we will see you right”. Now it’s all about “sharing the cost”.This matters because northern councils are seeing more cases and facing extra costs, not least on issues like homelessness. At the start of all this, the government rightly launched an “Everyone In” policy. We needed no persuading and already had a scheme in hand. However, a few weeks on, the goalposts were moved. When we said Everyone In, civil servants explained, we meant people who were homeless before the crisis, not those who have become homeless since.We are now left with 800 people in hotels and apartments but with insufficient funding to help them make a transition to a more secure placement. The communities secretary insists he is fully funding “Everyone In” but our councils see it differently. The gap between national government and local government in England is growing wider by the day.So where do we go from here?If the government carries on in the same vein, expect to see an even greater fracturing of national unity. Different places will adopt their own messaging and policies. Nervousness in the north about the R number will see more councils adopt their own approach on schools, as Liverpool, Gateshead and Hartlepool are doing. Arguments will increase about funding. And if we don’t get the help we need, there is a risk of a second spike here which, in turn, will pass the infection back down the country through the Midlands to London. Instead, the government needs to draw a line and show it is listening.Tomorrow morning, it should ask the mayor of the West Midlands to represent the non-London mayors on Cobra and commit to publish the regional R number, as requested by myself and the mayor of the Liverpool city region. They should quickly follow that by agreeing a transport funding package for cities to put on more buses and trams so that people can travel more safely to work. And something that would win back huge goodwill across all of England would be a commitment to honouring the promise to cover all costs incurred by councils, including on homelessness.We remain in the midst of a national crisis and we need a sense of national unity to get through it. We all need to work hard next week to bring that back.• Andy Burnham is mayor of Greater Manchester"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b20817b532414bbbf7d9812fd9ca54907fb53fef/0_93_2800_1681/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e92983eddb9beb7f1b5ee3940b54d559","title":"covid 19 coronavirus lockdown economy debate","story":"The class and racial consequences of this crisis mean we must think more carefully about how we ‘reopen’ the economyThe argument over lockdown seems to have crystallized into a simple – and simplistic – binary: health versus the economy. If you position yourself on the left, you value health over money, and so support the lockdown. That’s a mistake.The “health versus the economy” frame ignores how disastrous the lockdown has been to America’s poor. Despite rhetoric about “shared sacrifice”, the ability to self-isolate is overwhelmingly correlated to income. While middle-class professionals congratulate themselves for staying inside, their isolation is dependent on a class of workers who often labor without essential equipment or while ill. Making matters worse, these exposed workers also tend to have more of the health conditions – including hypertension and diabetes – that make Covid-19 so deadly. In America, getting sick is a class condition.To make matters worse, the government’s measures to mitigate the economic effects of Covid-19 lockdowns exacerbate previously existing inequalities. Trump’s much-vaunted bailout has created a multitrillion-dollar money supply for the largest corporations in the country, with almost no critical oversight requirements. At the same time, people whose livelihoods are being destroyed are being asked to make do with a one-off $1,200 payment, the conditions for which exclude many of those who need it most.This amounts to a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. Just like in 2008, capital has taken hold of the crisis, and turned it to its own advantage.Yet at this stage simply lifting the lockdown to get the economy going would do more harm than good. The lockdown has generated its own crisis. Immediately lifting the lockdown would risk exacerbating the damage already suffered by America’s poorest.In April, at least 20 million people filed for unemployment. The sectors most affected by these job losses – those predicated on face-to-face interaction – are overwhelmingly peopled by precariously employed, low-paid laborers who have little in the way of savings or capacity to weather this catastrophe. The lockdown thus doubly damns the poor: most likely to be made ill at work, they are also most likely to lose their jobs.That doesn’t mean it makes sense to rush people back to work in unsafe conditions that might lead to a new spike of infections. Many workers are rightly scared of returning to workplaces that do not properly ensure their safety. Given the intense competition that is likely to emerge over the few jobs that remain in America, many big employers may create a “race to be bottom” that forces workers to compete to accept dangerous working conditions.Taking the class and racial consequences of this crisis seriously means thinking more carefully about how we “reopen” the economy.One way to do this would have been a program of contact tracing, aimed at identifying, isolating and taking care of those who actually have the disease (or are most vulnerable to it), while allowing others to keep the economy going. Such a program was successfully undertaken in South Korea. Unfortunately, it may already be too late for this approach. In any event, Trump’s Republican base would never tolerate what they view as a violation of privacy.The strategy adopted by some northern European countries – such as Sweden – was another possibility. Keeping the economy going, while offering quality healthcare and other benefits to those who get sick, is less irrational than it might seem. That approach involves less economic disruption. Whether it leads to more deaths in the long run is still an open question. The problem is that the Swedish model pre-supposes a well-functioning healthcare system, whereas American healthcare has suffered decades of contraction under the brunt of neoliberal policies South Korea has three times as many hospital beds per 1,000 people as the US does.Neither the Swedish nor South Korean models are possible in America today, and neither resolve the true crisis that the US faces, which is dealing with the disaster caused by the lockdown. Rather than insisting on staying at home, the left should argue for implementing an end to the lockdown that actually answers the demands of the workers striking at Amazon, Checkers, Instacart, and elsewhere for safe working conditions and worker’s rights.A recent bill proposed by senators Sanders, Harris and Markey – which includes expanded unemployment insurance and the waiving of all student loan payments during the crisis – is a good start. But more must be done to address the structural inequalities that have made the coronavirus so deadly in the first place.Universal healthcare and a complete overhaul of working conditions and unemployment benefits must be part of any comprehensive strategy for economic recovery. So is a massive public investment program that doesn’t just focus on propping up the stock market, but actually creates long-lasting and well-paid jobs.The objections that were routinely raised against such proposals before the Covid-19 emergency centered on the difficulty of financing such programs. But if the way we have responded to the crisis has taught us anything, it’s that the money can be found when there’s a political will for it. It’s just a question of who we want it to benefit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1925093e8752a701728402bac9392ba78fcd6559/10_10_5066_3040/master/5066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b4c3aeb0f7e7c95acc20b3069f25d38","title":"in 20 years as journalist how many times messed up","story":"I’m ready to out myself for offending the nicest guy in the movie business – and fake bombing the This week marks my 20th anniversary in journalism, and given that there is absolutely no other news right now, I shall write about that.

But I have learned from my mistakes, and given that these include once slagging off a powerful magazine editor when said editor was standing right behind me, you can consider these lessons a masterclass from la crème de la crème.Lesson one: always do your prepI like Tom Hanks. You like Tom Hanks. We all like Tom Hanks, the nicest guy in the movie business™. Who could be so awful that Tom Hanks would have to reprimand them? Hi!Normally, before an interview, I read up on all relevant material. But with Hanks, I got cocky: sure, sure, Forrest Gump, Big, Sleepless In Seattle – I know my Hanks! And so, with the blithe confidence of a fool, I asked him why he had never played a villain. Suddenly, all the Hanksian “aw shucks”-ness fell away and he told me that he had played a villain, in the film Cloud Atlas. “You really should do your prep before an interview,” he scolded me, returning to that point several times and telling me to “check that film out”. I’m sorry, Tom Hanks. I never did watch Cloud Atlas and I’m sorry about that, too (kinda).Lesson two: record everythingEarly on, I was dispatched to interview Elizabeth Hurley about her swimsuit range. As this was just going to be a little thing, and about swimsuits, I thought I could get away with taking notes in my half-arsed shorthand. No chance. Hurley took a pointed glance at my notebook and placed not one but two dictaphones between us. “To be on the safe side,” she said, with a dagger of a smile. Chastened, I took out my dictaphone. I never went to journalism school, but I consider myself a graduate of the Hurley and Hanks School of Journalism.Lesson three: your boss is not your friendI blame the  for this misapprehension, because my first boss at the paper, fashion legend Jess Cartner-Morley, is very much my friend. She tolerated more from me in my decade on the fashion desk than most therapists would accept from their patients, including finding me multiple times under my desk sobbing over a boy. Other bosses have been less tolerant. There was the magazine editor I wrote for so often I thought I could share my personal problems with her. A firm “This is not appropriate, Hadley” corrected that. Your boss is your boss. They are not your friend. Tattoo this on the inside of your eyelids.Lesson four: check your factsBack in the very early days, I interviewed an author a decade or two older than me. I unthinkingly described her hair as “silver”. She complained, saying her hair was brown. We went back and forth and, with the callowness of youth, I thought the whole thing a bit absurd. Fast-forward a decade or so and I spotted this author at a book festival and she was right: her hair was brown. Also, no longer being so youthful myself, I have a lot more sympathy with such details.Lesson five: don’t bomb your officeOK, it’s finally time to tell this story. A while back, the tabloids had a running schtick in which they planted fake bombs near members of the royal family to show how badly guarded they were. A colleague came up with the wheeze that we should fake-bomb a tabloid paper, and so I made a bomb, a block of Blu-Tack stuck to a Chairman Mao alarm clock (long story). Lacking the necessary wiles, I failed to get past the security guard at the Sun so I returned to the , put my fake bomb on my desk and went to the bathroom. When I came out, the entire office was empty. Baffled, I looked out the window – and there were all of my colleagues, outside. Someone on obituaries had heard the ticking of the Chairman Mao alarm clock and called the bomb squad. I had succeeded in fake-bombing a newspaper office: it just happened to be my own.Other papers were soon calling the  to find out who the idiot was and, to his eternal credit, my then editor, Ian Katz, took the flak. Well, I can live on the run no more, and so I am outing myself as the actual  Bomber. And this is the number one thing I have learned about journalism: you will meet the greatest people, who will always have your back, no matter how stupid you are.Here’s to another 20 years in the job, if my poor bosses can bear it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7072707fd8718820aa68d5b5dcadaa1c0aa3e8c/0_40_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e04f4f8436d0144ed8b67302342e4db0","title":"nature lockdown summer holidays","story":"Summer holidays abroad look doomed, but there is comfort and reward to be found just by being curious about your surroundingsIt’s likely that we will all be spending time in our local areas for the foreseeable future and taking our holidays in our home countries rather than abroad. Could we bring to these experiences the same kind of curiosity we might feel when visiting a different city or landscape? Is it possible to find dynamism and novelty in our parks, streets and woodlands?During lockdown, I’ve come to know my nearest green spaces – my favourite a wild but urban cemetery – more deeply and gratefully. Instead of becoming bored, as I imagined I might, I’ve found that my local natural areas feel like new destinations each day, even by the hour, for nature is in constant flux. Bird songs are richest at dawn and dusk. The wild garlic smells stronger when the soil is warm. The nettles glow Kermit-green when the sun is low in the sky. The scarlet pimpernel shows itself when light and humidity are just so.Our lives are made from the things we pay attention to. Slowing down and observing – these are radical things to do in our accelerated age. It is only by being in lockdown that I have seen new treasures that I’d previously have overlooked: the bright pink cones of the larch tree, blankets of blue speedwell, neon red velvet mites. The more we pay attention, the more we see.The senses can help us notice more. I have heard a cuckoo twice this last week for the first time since childhood, in two different spots. It must be a combination of fewer aircraft and cars, and a craving and alertness for as much life as possible during that precious time outside.A rainy day will put a lot of people off a walk – though it often looks worse from the inside and woods look more beautiful when wet – but the smell of petrichor, the scent of the earth after it has rained, is worth seeking. It has been found to activate brain waves associated with calmness and relaxation.Sometimes I choose one element to focus on. It might be different shades of green, leaf shapes, the colours of stalks, lichen, tiny things, an abundance of things, things becoming other things. Every day there is a new “fellow” to look for, as my three-year-old puts it. In Hampshire, where I am, it might be swifts, mayflies, damselflies, speckled wood butterflies, slow worms, beetles, caterpillars. People are heterogeneous. You might love fungi I might love spiders. Find what you like.If you’re sheltering inside, houseplants, bird feeders outside a window, or a view of sunlight filtering through the leaves of a tree (the Japanese word for this is komorebi) can be therapeutic – and suggests that in resilient and fair societies everyone should be able to see nature from their windows, especially those without gardens.Over the last number of years I’ve spent writing Losing Eden, a book about nature and mental health, I’ve seen how crucial a connection with the living world is for our minds – and, on the flipside, that building eco-alienated human habitats and societies, where people have little access to nature, is unfair and a public health disaster. In recent years, psychologists are revealing the importance of noticing “nearby nature” and connecting with the living world for our wellbeing rather than simply spending time outdoors. Noticing nature is linked to pro-environmental behaviour. If we feel a kinship, we are more likely to seek a reciprocal relationship with other beings.The evidence that contact with nature – even a view out of a window – can enhance healing continues to grow. Nature might even be a balm for those dealing with loss and loneliness. At an ecotherapy group I attended while researching my book, a man shared how methodically noticing the plants on a daily walk helped him grieve. Many of us are frightened, bored, or missing loved ones, and watching spring unfurl can be a healthy kind of escapism. When the news feels overwhelming, the rhythms and patterns outside can be a steadying arm: the swifts returning, the tightly orchestrated symphony of wildflowers, the trees filling out.I’ve been noticing nature for a while, and I’ve only scratched the surface. Each season I’m surprised by new sights, which become familiar moments the following year, joined by other new happenings, layering upon each other. I think moving into a new kind of consciousness – a “plant consciousness”, as Richard Powers puts it – could be a lifelong journey, and a good one.You can find the wild near your home. You can find your place in the family of things, to use the poet Mary Oliver’s phrase. There is magic in the seemingly mundane. If you want more, you can find more. And it’s free.• Lucy Jones is a journalist and the author of Losing Eden: Why Our Minds Need the Wild"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec28dfbaa3d961335d642c953ddfe8a6503e25c7/0_0_4903_3083/master/4903.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b79d3bea91d27a58cd890b7e20906846 700w","title":"england plans to send the wrong children back to school at the wrong time","story":"The reopening of schools doesn’t seem to be about safety or learning – so what is it about?We have built a world where parents need the childcare provided by the school system. In some families parents are working at night, or rising at 5am to sustain a struggling business before their children wake up. They may more urgently feel the need for schools to reopen than those who can happily juggle a few hours of homeschooling with working from home.But think about what primary teachers are facing with the prospect of suddenly going back to school with gaggles of five- and six-year-olds. As one infant teacher said on the radio this week: “We’ll have six classes back, so we need at least 12 classrooms, but only have nine. The government has admitted we can’t socially distance, so they’re playing with our health. We are taking the children’s toys away, because they have to be constantly cleaned, what will they do all day? I’ve got four pages of issues like this!”On the other hand, a headteacher on the same show said: “Sitting around saying it’s too hard is no model for our young people.” Solutions had to be found.Schools are now hurriedly buying washing troughs and putting up sanitiser stations. Marking parent drop-off areas. Deep-cleaning canteens. Children will play in chalked circles on playgrounds. For a moment it sounds doable. But then, a child coughs in a narrow corridor another falls and hurts his knee. He’s crying, it’s bleeding. A child with special needs requires help with feeding and there is no protective equipment. And what happens if there’s a fight?Now imagine: it’s your daughter, your husband, or your best friend who is teaching. Are you happy for them to jump into these situations? It is too easy to be dismissive about low potential harm unless it’s your loved one taking the risk. It is vital that trade unions question hard and push for the safest possible conditions before schools can reopen.Certainty on safety is not possible, though. The virus is still mysterious and new complexities may yet arise. The experts have admitted a vaccine may never come. But imagine: it is your home at risk because you can’t work, or your sanity dwindling from the 57th day of home schooling, or your six-year-old sobbing because they miss their friends. Your heart’s calculator may now calibrate the risks differently. Schools reopening, at least in some form, would be a lifeline. We need to be smart about this.In Italy, Spain and Ireland schoolchildren will not return until autumn at the earliest. Wales and Scotland are leaning the same way. Yet, in England, politicians are putting their efforts into fighting with the unions for an early return – and one that initially offers just three year groups a poor, socially distanced, in-a-school-but-not-really-school experience for, at best, six weeks before the end of term.Meanwhile, many parents will still be unable to work because they have a child in another year group stuck at home but now have the added complexity of a heavily sanitised school run on top of it all.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary in England, should stop looking for fights. Instead, he should pause, and focus schools on doing distance learning really well by setting minimum standards for the remainder of the academic year. It seems right, for example, that every child should speak with a teacher at least once a week and receive meaningful feedback on work they have completed during that time.Why this approach has been missed is not clear. The Department for Education’s own scientific adviser admits he hasn’t seen any modelling around reopening schools and says the evidence on transmission is mixed. Is this about getting people back to work, or is it a classic Conservative trick of fuelling union strife to ert public attention from government failings and aim it towards a profession with a well-protected salary?Whatever it is, it doesn’t seem to be about safety or learning. There are no easy answers but Williamson can find smarter solutions. The question is whether he has the courage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1c6359ffc6bebd6101e77d222c97b78e217e947/0_584_5655_3392/master/5655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25bc333478ceb888965ad0c329f56352","title":"how urban planners preference for male trees has made your hay fever worse","story":"Horticulturists urge better sex mix of city trees to mitigate rising asthma and CO2 pollution levelsEight years ago Tom Ogren, a horticulturist, was in Sacramento, California, when he noticed that the ground around the State Capitol building was covered in thick yellow pollen.Scanning the trees along the street with his binoculars, he saw the trees were all deodar cedars (Cedrus deodara) and all cultivated males.Naturally, the deodar is monoecious, having both male and female cones growing on the same tree. But cultivation has produced wholly male trees – plants favoured by planners since they have no seeds or pods to drop but only pollen. This was the case at this Sacramento site, Ogren said.Growers’ breeding of purely male diodar trees had created, said Ogren, “something that doesn’t even exist in nature”.Ogren said he had seen similar pollen-coated cityscapes in Christchurch, New Zealand, London, UK, and all over Canada. “Everywhere I’ve gone, same situation,” he said.Male trees are often favoured by urban landscape planners as female trees can shed fruit as well as seeds and pods.Pollen producing trees that are dioecious (with male and female flowers on separate plants) are seen to add to the effect of allergies of city dwellers .Today, hay fever affects more than 400 million people worldwide. More than 300 million people have asthma, often an effect of hay fever, and that number is expected to rise by 100 million by 2025.Allergenic tree pollen was found to be one of the biggest contributors to hay fever and asthma, and pollen counts have also been rising over the past 15 years.This health issue is going largely unaddressed despite there being a simple solution: a bigger mix of male and female trees in urban areas.While some cities were beginning to catch on, Ogren said, getting the methodology widely adopted was an uphill battle.He began researching allergenic plants and trees more than 30 years ago, when, with his wife, he moved to San Luis Obispo, California. His wife developed terrible allergies, he said. After studying the flora in their neighbourhood he understood the reason – all the tree species were males.Trees can be one of three sexes – monecious, dioecious male or dioecious female. Naturally, there is a relatively even split between all three, so the amount of pollen wafted into the air is regulated. But when dioecious males are planted independently of dioecious females, as often the case in urban areas, their pollen is unchecked by any capture by female flowers.Landscape plans of cities across the US revealed the planting pattern to Ogren. When he dug deeper he found a note in the 1949 USDA Yearbook of Agriculture reading: “When used for street plantings only male trees should be selected, to avoid the nuisance from the seed.” He said it was “botanical sexism”.Ogren added that when Dutch elm disease wiped out a portion of America’s elm trees in the late 1960s urban landscapers ordered more than 100 varieties of male maple clones as replacements then other male varieties followed. Since cloning proved quicker than waiting for trees to pollinate and grow naturally, male clones began to dominate the tree nurseries too. It was not just in the US. Ogren saw the same trend wherever he travelled.By 2000 Ogren had collected so much data on tree species he was able to create his Ogren Plant Allergy Scale (Opals). It was the first numerical ranking system in existence for plant allergies. It is now used by the USDA Urban and Community Forestry programme to develop allergy rankings in large US cities.Nigel Clarke, one of the UK’s largest distributors of female trees, met Ogren at a plant workshop in Guernsey and they began to help each other with a mutual mission – mitigation of urban tree pollen.“If plant distributors, by their plant choices, are responsible for the rising numbers of allergy sufferers in urban areas, then we, by making the correct plant choices, can at least reduce the amount of allergenic pollen in the air,” said Clarke. Now, he said, he tagged all his trees using Opals to ensure his buyers were better informed.Ogren’s work has also had an impact in several cities in Canada, where he was commissioned to do a tree allergy audit. The town of Hamilton, for example, has adopted more allergy-friendly urban planting policies, largely due to Peter Prakke, a nurseryman who has been advocating allergy-free schoolyards and public parks for the past 10 years, using Ogren’s work as a guide.Vancouver, Edmonton and Halifax are also working towards balancing their tree populations so as to reduce allergies. But these are only small pockets of success. Clifford Bassett, founder of Allergy and Asthma Care, of New York, said: “I see a growing number of patients each year who suffer from seasonally triggered allergies. Warmer temperatures, the longer pollen season, and rising carbon dioxide levels are likely to contribute to increasing sensitisation to pollen.”Studies have shown that air pollution particulates attach to pollen grains, which causes the powdery substance to shatter into still tinier pieces. “When that happens the inside of the pollen grain is exposed and that’s 10 times more allergenic than the outside,” explained Ogren.Ogren suggested that all sufferers should get together and “demand protection” as “a basic human right”, adding: “We could have pollen-free lawns, hedges, trees, all of this, it’s all doable, but only if enough people know about it and if the right people raise enough fuss about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c081db621a375c37cde624c47a59e1de895f05f/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be852bb9f4a5d4d42397deefc907321a 660w","title":"jack monroe life on a plate back up plan supermarket","story":"The cook and campaigner talks about growing up in a house full of foster children, her large appetite, and why she doesn’t take her career for grantedI was born in Southend in the late 80s and now I live back there, near to where I grew up. I remember going on adventures with my older brother and, when I was 11, being allowed to go to the corner shop alone, and filling up a bag with penny chews, Fruit Salads, Bruiser bars and Black Jacks.My parents fostered about 100 children from when I was four onwards. Some stayed for 24 hours and some for 13 years. We were always getting folding chairs out of the garage and budging up to make space at the table or putting another jacket potato in the oven.My parents tended to cook big batch food because there was always the possibility that other children would turn up with their carrier bag and shoes and we had to gently bring them out of their shells. One of the big catalysts for that was firstly sitting them at the table and eating with them. Only as an adult do I understand the emotional significance and security of that.I’d been at the end of my tether as a single mother writing a political blog. Then I became a trainee reporter on the Southend Echo. I can tell you exactly what I ate then at my desk – pasta with butter and the occasional scotch egg, out of Tupperware. I had basically no money until my first pay cheque came through, but when it did I put some chicken in my pasta. And some cheese, if I was being profligate.I remember when my mother first took me to a proper hairdresser, instead of having her friend Julie round, or my nan’s friend Lois to trim my fringe at the dining table. He was Barry at Legend in the town centre. It was the first time I had biscotti with tea and I said, embarrassingly, “These biscuits are really hard”, when they were meant to be.Last night I ate a whole family-size macaroni cheese. I’d planned to put half back in the fridge. I have a surprisingly large appetite anyway and I don’t drive, I walk everywhere, I don’t sit down at the moment and I pace the hallway when I’m on the phone. I think that if I didn’t eat large amounts of carbs and cheese I would wither away into a husk.I did take testosterone for six to nine months and I was very hungry and very randy all the time. A most dangerous combination. I stopped – and I’ve got to be careful how I word this – basically, I got as far down that path as I wanted to go. I never wished to transition to be a man, I just wanted to knock some of my edges off. The thing about testosterone is that when you stop taking it, you soften back up again, although I’ve still got a few extra hairs on my chin which will never go away. But what that period taught me is that I’m pretty comfortable in this skin as it is. But I think if I hadn’t done it – and my story is in no way representative of other people – it would have driven me mad.If I’ve learned anything in the last seven or eight years it’s that my career flies by the seat of my pants and that every time I’m booked for something, I’m ill, and anything – like a TV opportunity – I treat as my last ever one because it’s maybe my swansong. It’s impossible to plan for the future and I don’t take anything for granted. I’m consistently surprised when I’m commissioned to do anything, despite appearances.My back-up plan, if everything dries up, is going back to the supermarket, where I’ve worked before. I’ll sit on the checkout and, as food passes, I’ll say: “Do you know what you could do with that? I have a great recipe for that.”FoodIn my nan’s spare bedroom I found a row of Jilly Cooper novels and in one it said that the female protagonist had a body which looked like it had been raised entirely on tinned peaches. I thought, “Great, that’s a diet I can go with”, and I’ve noshed down on them ever since.DrinkI gave up a year-and-a-half ago. I’ve fallen off the wagon, in a minor way, a couple of times since but think I’ve got a handle on it. Nowadays, in the evening, I’ll make a Thermos flask of tea and take it to bed.Dish to makeMy auntie Helen, a minuscule woman we stayed with in Plymouth during summers, would often make avgolemono soup as would Mother, at 3pm on Sundays.

But the queue at the greengrocer, marked out by the taped lines we’ve all come to know so well, was more than usually long, and so it was that the other day I finally went in. I saw the fresh coriander straightaway, and grabbed it. But then I spied something else, even more lusted after: fresh naans as big as satellite dishes Middle Eastern flatbreads as long and as soft as linen table runners. Treasure. I gathered up bags of each, paid, and went home feeling thrilled: another discovery made.Has this happened to you? During the lockdown, my mind maps have completely changed. I walk for an hour each day, usually at about 5pm, always heading east from my front door, which is less leafy than in other directions, but vastly more interesting: mosques nestling up to baptist chapels plaques dedicated to long forgotten aldermen terraced houses that seem to come in one of only two states (peeling like psoriasis, or fully Farrow \u0026amp Ball-ed). Sometimes, I’m not after any shopping, and on those occasions I just take it all in, my eyes working to peel back the layers of the city. Often, though, I am in need of something, even if I don’t know exactly what – and these perambulations are even more satisfying. I go in for tea bags or rice, and come out bearing halva, or a paper bag of the loquats, golden and mottled, that I loved in my Jaffa childhood. The other day, standing in a corner shop that seemed to specialise mostly in tortilla chips, I found a box of pink wafers. I’d forgotten all about pink wafers! Reader, I bought them.City walking is mournful, of course. It tears at the heart, the sight of beloved pubs, now closed, that you only wish you’d used more. Will they ever reopen? How are their staff doing? In one, a boozer of which I’m particularly fond, even now a huge bowl of lemons still stands hopefully on the bar. And then there are the restaurants, shuttered and silent. Sometimes, I stop and read their menus, a rite that feels increasingly strange and melancholy. One warm afternoon, I turned a corner to be greeted by the sight of a hitherto unknown ice-cream parlour. The moment, seconds later, when I realised that its discovery would make no material difference to my life – at least for the time being – was, I can tell you, heavy indeed. (Did they sell pistachio and raspberry ripple? Peering in, I could not tell.)But there are moments of intense gladness, too. When the young Italian guys at the end of our street reopened their pizzeria for takeaway, happiness rose inside me, the sound of their shouting and laughter every bit as much of a tonic as the prospect of a napoletana. The pluck of the restaurants that are selling their dishes through a hastily fashioned serving hatch straight onto the street lifts the heart. “We are still here and baking,” says the hand-written sign in the window of our local patisserie, and it does us so much good, on a Saturday, to buy croissants there – and, when available, a tarte tropezienne. (The cream-filled, orange-flower-scented brioche which, having been named by Brigitte Bardot when she was in St Tropez filming And God Created Woman - its inventor, a Polish baker called Alexandre Micka, was hired by Roger Vadim to cater for the crew - allows me briefly to slip into my swimming costume and a little Ambre Solaire, albeit only in my mind.)So, I walk and I walk. I am a tramper, a flaneuse with a rucksack and a half-memorised recipe scrolling through my mind. If I’m lucky, when I get home, my neighbour Julia will have left on our doorstep one of her own fine loaves, or perhaps a wedge of victoria sponge cake. I’m always hungry by this point, and I’m usually much happier than when I left, too. I eat the first slice standing up, my purchases on the kitchen counter promising a future that I hope very much will come sooner rather than later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/241888cea412e87fa8282a5155351d9f557a9cd0/0_509_5792_3474/master/5792.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a34024abb4b15d12fb397fbb6eda0b09","title":"gianluca vialli interview donald mcrae italy chelsea sampdoria juventus cremonese","story":"The former Chelsea and Italy forward talks openly about cancer, overcoming adversity and the future“You feel that you are letting someone down, like your parents,” Gianluca Vialli says as his memories of cancer return with renewed force. His voice is grainy with hurt and, even on Skype, his eyes glisten. “You don’t want your parents to see you in a lot of pain.”The former Italy striker, who played for and managed Chelsea, pauses because the tears have choked him. Vialli is at his home in Chelsea, where he is in lockdown with his wife and two teenage daughters. His elderly parents live in Cremona, the town in northern Italy which has been hit so hard by the coronavirus. He cannot talk as he remembers why he did not tell them when he was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2017.I break the silence because it’s understandable he would not wish his parents to suffer. “Yes,” the 55-year-old agrees as he composes himself. “There is also all this shame. I’ve always been perceived as a tough guy. A strong guy with a lot of determination. To not be in that position made me uneasy. I didn’t want to be looked at as a poor guy with a disease. That’s why I didn’t share it widely for 12 months.“It’s also a burden. People will call to show they’re thinking about you. I thought that, instead of spending time on the phone, I needed time for myself. That’s why I wore a jumper under the shirt – to hide that I’d lost so much weight. These feelings are natural and stay with you a while. And then, at least in my case, they go away. The day you start looking at things differently, your life changes. Now I show my scars with pride. They are a sign of what I’ve been through.”Vialli played 59 matches for Italy. He helped Sampdoria win the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1990 and their first Serie A title a year later. He lifted another Scudetto and the Champions League with Juventus. That 1996 final was his last game before he became a Chelsea player and then their manager during his four years at Stamford Bridge.He has always been amiable and intelligent but, over the course of a 70-minute conversation, Vialli emerges as an even more impressive man. “I know now that you need to let out the pain,” he says. “I wasn’t particularly good at showing my emotions and I kept things inside. It’s not good. Now I realise that whenever I want to cry, I cry. There’s no shame. And if you want to laugh, you laugh. I try not to cry in front of people that might get very emotional. I try to cry by myself. When I’m in a comfortable place, I don’t hold anything inside. I just let it out, and I feel better afterwards.”Vialli is remarkably comfortable in this interview, even when reflecting on the closeness of death and revealing that he now faces tests every three months to check whether he is still clear of the disease. He nods in acknowledgement when I ask if his past as a footballer prevented him from expressing his emotions before cancer turned his life inside out. “Yes. We portrayed ourselves as tough guys that could deal with anything without showing any weakness. But I now realise the power of vulnerability and that, actually, it can be a powerful tool to get inside people’s hearts. It creates empathy – and empathy is everything. I’m not ashamed of saying we all cry – sometimes because we are scared. In my case I was crying because I was scared of the unknown. I did not know whether I was going to be fine or not. It’s different than if you cry because you’ve lost a match.”He laughs wryly at the fleeting pain of football. Vialli’s outlook on life has clearly changed over the past three years – while he has endured two separate nine-month spells of chemotherapy, which eventually led to his being declared cancer-free last December.“This is my personal view,” Vialli says. “But my friends, people who eventually knew about my condition, said: ‘Come on, you’re going to win this fight. You can beat cancer.’ I always felt I didn’t want to fight cancer, because it would be too big and powerful an enemy. I felt this is a journey. It’s about the right therapies and the right doctors. It’s about travelling with an unwanted travel companion until hopefully it gets bored and dies before me.”Vialli is in a philosophical mood as we discuss his new book, Goals, which features 90 stories about inspirational sportsmen and women who overcame adversity. They range from Jackie Robinson and Jesse Owens to Billie Jean King and Natalie du Toit, Alex Zanardi and Emil Zatopek to LeBron James and Ronda Rousey. They read even more powerfully at a time of great crisis for the world, as each story is preceded by a mantra of hope.“That’s the key mantra,” Vialli says. “It’s all about the way we deal with situations. Alex could’ve gone into a depression, but why focus on the negative? In my situation, I was shocked when I heard I had cancer. But then I thought: ‘I’ve got to make this a journey that helps me grow. I don’t always see it that way, but that’s my aim.”The book ends with the most compelling story – as Vialli details how two bouts of cancer and chemotherapy affected him. “I found out that pancreatic cancer is one of the worst cancers,” he recalls. “So I was shocked, confused, helpless, hopeless. But it helped that I’d been an athlete. I was used to getting injured and so with cancer I could say: ‘Operation? When? You’re discharging me? When? Then I’m starting chemo? For how long?’ For me it was about setting goals. I also know that nothing is permanent and it will all pass.”Vialli would learn another brutal truth. Remission can be temporary. His cancer came back in March 2019. “We thought everything was going OK. And then, all of a sudden, you get a temperature. You go for a blood test and they say: ‘Let’s make sure there’s nothing sinister.’ I found out then. It was back.”Vialli leans closer to the screen. “To be honest,” he says, “I asked myself: ‘Did you really think you were going to get away with cancer that easily?’ The second time was definitely tougher because it’s the cumulative effect. I wasn’t so strong and there was some despair. You’re thinking: ‘Oh my God, this guy is back.’”Another nine blurring months of chemotherapy passed and, in December 2019, Vialli was given fresh hope. “They call it NED,” he explains. “No evidence of disease. I’m perfectly aware it will take a while before I’m given the all clear. Unfortunately, these things have a tendency to come back. But at the moment I am in a good place. I hope to stay in a good place until I die of old age.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200512-56802-gnl.fsof.200513.jf.Fascism.mp3 Vialli has anxious days when he worries if the cancer will return. But he spends more time talking about gratitude. “I’ve learned that gratitude is a very powerful emotion. And I’m very grateful to many wonderful people – my wife and family and all the people who have looked after me. They’re not just competent and knowledgeable. They really feel what you’re going through and there’s a great deal of empathy. I’m looked after at the Royal Marsden in Chelsea. It’s an amazing hospital.”Has it been difficult to maintain such positivity amid Covid-19? “For me it has been hard because I come from Cremona. It probably has the highest death rate in the region. In a way I feel I should be there with my people. I felt so bad reading that people were dying in hospital without their loved ones. It’s a tragedy.“Staying at home in Chelsea is not a problem. I can work remotely. I can walk to the park. My wife and daughters are here and it’s great to be with them 247. In London I only know two people that tested positive. Thank God I have not lost anyone I know in this country. But it’s different in Cremona where there are only 80,000 people. London has six million people. You feel it more in a smaller place.”What does Vialli think of the Premier League trying to resume next month? “In times of grief, and when you’re going through a difficult situation like this, some psychologists say we should try to do things that give us pleasure without feeling guilty about it. So if football could be a tool to give people some relief then I look forward to its return.“That said, I can only imagine what the players are feeling. I could advise them about injury or when they fall out with the manager. I can share my experiences with them. But in this situation I wouldn’t know what to tell them. This is unprecedented. If I was still a player, I would probably find it difficult to focus on football because people are still dying.”Since last October he has worked alongside Roberto Mancini, his former Sampdoria teammate, who now manages Italy. “I have started this new chapter as the head of the Italian national team football delegation. I am so happy I’ve ended up working with my best friend. It feels great to be able to help Roberto and I love trying to inspire the players. My contract runs to the end of the World Cup in Qatar in December 2022. We are carrying on and trying to do as much as possible.”It seems fitting that Vialli should express his optimism before we say goodbye. “I must think positively,” he says. “I’ve also got to acknowledge when I have some negative thoughts. Acknowledge, separate and challenge them. Yes, I am positive personally. I am also positive about the world. The crisis will pass. What I’d like to see next is that we do not forget these lessons.“If you look at climate change we have a chance to do something about it. We are now saying health is the most important thing. Great. Why, once the virus is gone, would we go back to living in a place where the air is so polluted? Why don’t we prevent people getting sick and dying from pollution? Surely we should be prepared to give up a little bit of our wealth, our so-called quality of life, for a safer and healthier planet? I feel very strongly about this kind of future.”Goals: Inspirational Stories to Help Tackle Life’s Challenges by Gianluca Vialli is published by Headline"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e05c385870589cbc9bb9c085189f602461ca2118/0_114_5897_3540/master/5897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7edc8a1a6dfc0ba7f2865bcff0fcf48a","title":"zlatan ibrahimovic statue may be moved malmo stadium vandalism","story":"Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s statue is likely to be relocated from outside Malmö’s stadium to another site in the city after repeated acts of vandalism.The statue was unveiled outside the Swedbank Stadium last October but has come under attack since Ibrahimovic, who began his career with Malmö FF, became a part-owner of Hammarby, a rival top-flight club based in Stockholm.The statue was sprayed with paint and had its nose cut, before being sawn off at the ankles and overturned. The statue was removed in early January for repairs and has been kept in a secret location ever since.Anders Malmstrom, the city’s media spokesman, has confirmed the council is seeking to relocate the statue. On Monday, a working committee will propose that the statue should stay in the city but be moved away from the stadium. Malmstrom did not say whether the club had been briefed on the issue.The 9’10” bronze statue weighs 500kg and was created by sculptor Peter Linde. It shows Ibrahimovic standing bare-chested with open arms. It cost 500,000 Swedish krona (£42,000) to make, with maintenance costs paid by the city.Ibrahimovic was born in Malmö and broke into the club’s first team in 1999, moving to Ajax in 2001. The forward, now 38 and under contract with Milan, has also played for Juventus, Internazionale, Barcelona, PSG and LA Galaxy and is Sweden’s all-time top international scorer.Some have suggested the statue should be moved to Stockholm, where Ibrahimovic owns property and the Swedish FA, which commissioned the statue, is based. In February the mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, suggested the statue could be moved to Italy but Malmö city officials rejected the proposal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aad048570536fc8de7b44651fba0b6cbc6cf794/0_46_5108_3066/master/5108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea17e38d9a3a661aac304d7f93dc111","title":"germany borussia dortmund schalke","story":"Borussia Dortmund’s win over Schalke was a welcome return for a sport that has been reborn as a deeply strange spectacleIn Leipzig the players bumped elbows and grinned like this was all a little bit silly. In Dortmund Erling Haaland scored the first goal of football’s plague times and stood by the corner flag with his teammates around him in a celebratory pastiche of social distancing, a strangely haunting image that will, you suspect, be recycled many times.Welcome to the new abnormal normal. Which is, needless to say, a fairly strange place to be. And yet for all the oddity of its staging, something did seem to shift over the 90 minutes of Borussia Dortmund’s 4-0 defeat of Schalke at Signal Iduna Park, one of six comeback fixtures to take place in the Bundesliga, two months since football – and that rather less urgent entity, the world – went into standby mode.There was encouragement here for the industry. By the end it wasn’t too hard to see how televised football might re-emerge as a functioning entity. No spitting. No hugging. No fans. No noise beyond the constant muffled echo of managerial shrieking, like the sound of somebody being water-boarded in the flat upstairs.But still, it worked after a fashion. There were early moments of double-take. No doubt the sight of players arriving in protective gear on sparsely occupied buses will become commonplace in time.There was the deeply weird sight of the masked subs spread in a line in their large leather touchline seats, a row of ejected fighter pilots. Both sets of players grinned and shrugged as they warmed up in front of empty stands. At one point Haaland burst out laughing.Signal Iduna Park was a poignant venue in this respect, a ground that is as much as any in Europe an emblem of the importance of here and now and being present. This is an unshowy footballing giant, lodged in the leafy flatlands of the Ruhr and circled by low-lying industrial hubs. On match days the walkways are crammed with sausage stalls and beer taps. This is the essence of Dortmund, the place where the club’s heart is located. They had 81,365 in here for the last home game, in February. The contrast in the opening seconds was stark. Why are we actually playing, you kept wondering as the ball was passed around with a forced sense of urgency and Dortmund in particular seemed to be playing through a laudanum haze.There is, of course, a note of weirdness in the basic idea of football as our first shared step to normality. There’s a famous Dave Chapelle joke about MTV broadcasting the views of the rapper Ja Rule shortly after the Word Trade Centre was taken down. As Chapelle points out: “I want some answers that Ja Rule might not have right now.” Perhaps there are those among us who felt all along that one day Steve McManaman would be the voice to guide our first tentative steps out of a global pandemic. But then football was always likely to jostle its way to the front of this queue, to plonk its tankard down on the bar for first helpings.And it must be said BT Sport’s pared-back team did a fine job with a deeply odd occasion. James Richardson, ruggedly nautical in greying lockdown beard, looked absolutely delighted to be anchoring the show. His chief pundit Rafael Honigstein’s usual air of ironic distances was only enhanced by the vast expanse of desk between them.On commentary Paul Dempsey worked hard, and successfully, to bridge the oddity on the pitch, although it was touch and go at first. The ball was passed in silence. There was a foul and nobody howled or screamed. Was this the promised end, the final word on football as metaphor for the emptiness of modern life , the futility of consumer culture? Perhaps not.Steadily the day began to move, the old muscle memory kicking in. Football began to happen.Changes will no doubt be made. The games will need something to cover the empty seats and also some kind of soundtrack. Not music, that would be awful. Perhaps just a kind of monotone noise-cancelling drone that blocks out all sense of sound from your brain. Is Mark Lawrenson even available?Haaland scored with 29 minutes gone, the absence of a crowd offering the bonus of a lovely “ching” noise as the ball hit the pole in the side of the net. And Dortmund ran the rest of the game. The final minutes were a kind of zombie game, played out by some tired athletes on both sides.No matter, though. The key elements are back. Television schedules will be filled. The rolling advert boards are fired up once more. Evonik’s pitch-side awning is visible to the world, for all the good it’s going to do them. And no doubt the Premier League, fearful of losing market share, will now look to accelerate its own return.Before then it must be said that Germany has earned this, has earned the right to be first, to stand alone, crowd-less, staging football. The Bundesliga isn’t declaring this health crisis to be over. It is instead declaring its own government’s relative competence in the early months of this crisis, the mass testing that means football’s own demands – testing through the whole process for all players and officials – makes it part of the wider culture rather than a special case.In Britain the approach has been woollier, to the extent the Premier League would be a most unwelcome guest in the middle of this loss of control. For now, though, we can at least see a way back: quieter, a little odd in its rules – no celebrations, plenty of shirt grabbing – but thoroughly welcome all the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7f7b391b96aadcc033ac13548ef5469257552a0/0_18_4008_2405/master/4008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=912d9860b99b88391792d0d440de157f","title":"premier league return coronavirus lockdown","story":"Premier League was right to stop when it did but with every other UK industry looking at how to restart, why not football?It is now 10 weeks since league football was last played in England, the longest suspension of the game since the inauguration of the League in 1888 (although there used to be a respectful pause for three months in the summer for cricket). Even during the wars, football did not stop for as long as this. As the Bundesliga resumes and the Premier League steps up its plans for a restart, it’s worth considering why. Money may be a prime driving force now, but that hasn’t always been the case since it was invented there has been an urge to get football played.On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. The following day, there was a full English league programme. A day later the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, large public gatherings were suspended and the season abandoned. Yet within two months, regional leagues had been established. Arsenal, for instance, hammered Sunderland 5-2 on 2 September and then beat Charlton 8-4 in their inaugural southern league fixture on 21 October. It is difficult to be sure of attendances, but in excess of 10,000 turned up for both their games against West Ham.The War Cup final on 8 June 1940 – which kicked off at 6.30pm despite fears of bombing raids – drew 42,300 to Wembley, the restrictions on public gatherings long since lifted. The remarkable aspect of football in the second world war is how much of it there was. In Germany, they kept playing until the end of April 1945. In France, war champions were declared each year, although the 1943-44 season was incomplete. The Netherlands missed only one season, Italy two.Hungary was invaded twice, first by the Germans and then by the Soviets, and yet football never stopped. At times the juxtaposition of detail becomes absurd. On 6 December 1944, with Nazi-occupied Budapest under bombardment from the Red Army, the Ujpest coach, Geza Kertesz, who was working with a resistance group that had been supplying details on troop movements to the United States, took a training session then held a press conference previewing the upcoming derby against Ferencvaros. That evening he was arrested by local fascists and handed over to the Gestapo two months later he was executed as the Germans prepared to retreat.Which tell us what, exactly? First, that football is resilient. It adapts to circumstance and carries on, whether that means rejigging competitions and regulations, guest players or limited crowds. Second, and perhaps more pertinently, there has always been a demand for it, from both authorities and fans.After the German invasion of Ukraine, a league was quickly established as part of a process of “normalisation” – which is what led ultimately to the “death match” between Start, a bakery side that featured a number of former Dynamo Kyiv players, and a team representing the Luftwaffe. The logic that encouraged the Hungarian authorities to keep football going is the same that led the British government to waive the restrictions on crowds so people could still gather to watch football. And that is the impact football has on morale.This is not something to be treated glibly – and there is an obvious difference with wartime in the risk of the virus being transmitted by the act of playing. Danny Rose is right to fear players being forced back prematurely. But just because Dominic Raab says something doesn’t necessarily make it superficial nonsense it can also be glib for amateur virologists to dismiss out of hand the attempt to create a safe environment for football.It may be that any football that is played ends up being tepid, that the sense of artificiality is overpowering, the absence of fans a huge turn-off. Once Liverpool have sealed their Premier League title, how engaging will the battle against relegation or for qualification to the Champions League be, particularly when it’s far from clear if or in what form next season’s Champions League will take place? On the other hand, the FA Cup may find itself reinvigorated.And, of course, the how is hugely complex. But if the infection rate falls, if the resources are available and if a safe environment can be created, then why would football not be considering a resumption? Every other industry is assessing how to restart as lockdown begins to ease: why not football?Football was right to stop when it did but it’s right for it to consider when and how it may return. Judging precisely when the risk has been sufficiently minimised is clearly enormously difficult, there is every reason for extreme caution, and players need to be fully involved in the process, but that doesn’t mean the assessment should be shirked. If the necessary threshold of safety can be achieved, the palliative effect of resumption is potentially huge. This is not just about the game or money.CS Lewis observed that literature exists to remind us we are not alone. Football fulfils a similar function. It is the currency in which a vast amount of social interaction is conducted. Governments recognised that in times of crisis throughout the 20th century but football has never been bigger than it is now. After weeks of isolation, there has perhaps never been a time when it has been more important to remember we are not alone. Football can be an awful, self-interested, avaricious game at times but it can, perhaps, help with that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/500e9fb692b831bbb5f9de85e5655d3d0e8d6307/1490_956_5552_3331/master/5552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f2018b602b77c60c9237ef881438d4c","title":"beans three ways a trio of recipes for your store cupboard staple","story":"As a nation it’s safe to say we are baked bean lovers, and for years families have been passing on their unique bean recipes. Anna Masing serves up three fresh dinner ideas and gets the family stories behind the recipesYou can’t beat mopping up that delicious sauce with a piece of bread after a fry-up. But beans have moved on from the cooked breakfast. People proudly boast about their personalised recipes and each generation adds a new twist to a family favourite. Whether it’s breakfast, lunch or dinner, there’s always room for beans on our plate.With increasing health concerns about the reduction of sugar in our diet, Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz lets this comfort food become a convenient staple for health-conscious people. Here are three recipes built from love and tradition for you to try.Recipe developer and food editor Nadine Brown makes this dish for her family – her partner, her eight-year-old daughter and two-year-old niece: “It’s perfect for a hungry family with little patience,” she says.The dish is based on a recipe Brown developed a few years ago, but with tweaks made specifically for her family. Beans have always been a favourite in their house: “They taste great on their own or in a dish like this,” Brown explains. “The basil goes deliciously with the tomatoes and beans,” she says, talking about working with flavours, and adding more vegetables helps to get the kids their five a day. The no added sugar version is also something that Brown is pleased about: “It helps me keep an eye on the amount of sugar we consume in the house.”This dish is also about ease – it’s a “bung it all in one” dinner. Cooked in one dish, it can be simply brought to the table, and makes cleaning up a breeze. This is a dish that features on the weekends in Brown’s household, when they don’t have to think about work or school and can enjoy spending time together eating a meal in a relaxed way.Ingredients8 pork sausages4 garlic cloves, skin on, lightly bashed1 tbsp olive oil2 red onions, cut into wedges1 red pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks1 green pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks2 x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz30g basil leaves, roughly torn300g cherry tomatoes on the vineFreshly cracked black pepperCrusty bread to serveMethodPreheat your oven to 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6.Add the sausages and garlic to a large, deep oven tray and drizzle with the oil.

Roz explains: “My mother made us minestrone regularly and this is an evolution of her recipe parmesan rind was suggested by an Italian friend. And baked beans was my addition.” For Zoe’s recipe, it has been about making tiny tweaks. “Mum has the recipe nailed so it’s hard to beat, but I add fried bacon, as the flavour melts into the whole dish, giving it a little extra depth and texture. Also, I add a pinch of smoked paprika to suit my Portuguese husband’s palate.”This dish is woven with personal memories. Roz tells how she grew up in the Middle East and had mainly American friends, so Heinz was a familiar brand and is reminiscent of that time. For Zoe, baked beans, and this recipe, are memories of childhood and comfort: “A rainy Sunday afternoon? Soup time. Off school sick? Definitely time to bring out the big guns of Mum’s minestrone. The smell of it cooking is beyond delicious, filling the house.“When discussing this recipe with Mum,” Zoe says, “she revealed its greatest quality – using what you have.” Utilising leftovers was a key part of the family home when growing up, and an ethos Zoe has continued. This recipe is easy to adapt and uses many basic store cupboard standards – especially the beans. And, after the extravagance of Christmas, this recipe offers a nourishing and healthier alternative thanks to the no added sugar beans.A store cupboard classic this is a British take on the famed Italian recipe. Without the optional bacon, it works as a main dish for vegetarians, and without the wine and chilli, it’s a great supper for kids.Preparation: 10 minutesCooking time: 20 minutesTotal time: 30 minutesServes: 4 as a light meal or 6 as a starterIngredients1 large red onion, chopped3 garlic cloves, crushed2 medium carrots, dicedHalf a red pepper, diced1 400g tin chopped tomatoes1 415g tin of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz1 handful of orzo or similar small pastaSaltfreshly ground pepperParmesan cheese (including rind)1 tsp Heinz tomato ketchup1 tbsp light olive oilA pinch of dried mixed herbs1 bay leaf1 small red chilli or a small pinch of chilli flakes (optional)125ml wine (red or white) or 2 dsp dry vermouth (optional)4 rashers of streaky bacon (optional)MethodSweat the onion, carrot and pepper gently in the oil for about 5 minutes.

This is a dish that has developed from family tradition and his rich cultural heritage. Rehncy speaks about how his love of cooking started young: “My parents are Indian but born in east Africa. Growing up in Tanzania I would spend time at my dad’s Indian restaurant with the chefs in the kitchen.”This has stood him in good stead – on a lads’ getaway he cooked this dish for 20 friends as the only one able to cook, he was responsible for making sure they were fed for the trip.Rehncy’s mother died when he was young and all hands were on deck in the house a memory he has is his father’s Saturday tradition of a fry-up, with baked beans being a staple. One Saturday his father added a twist – onions, spices and chillies – the beginnings of this recipe. Thadka loosely means to add spice. “When you create any Indian dish you need a base to start. Our base is the beans, and any spices added are the thadka,” says Rehncy. “I chose these spices because they’re simple, easy and most importantly, are in every Indian household – classics.”He says the masala beans go well with toast, eggs, or, as his wife loves them, straight out of the bowl!Rehncy adds that the no added sugar variant is great because most of the adults in his family are diabetic and this allows them to eat baked beans more often than not.Ingredients (per 2x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz)2 tbsp rapeseed oil1 white onion (finely diced)4 cloves garlic (finely chopped)4cm piece of ginger (grated or finely chopped)2 green chilli (finely chopped)1 tsp turmeric1 tsp cumin powder1 tsp mustard seeds1 tsp coriander powder1 tsp garam masala powderSmall bunch of fresh corianderMethodAdd the oil to a saucepan on a medium heat (enough for the tin of Heinz beans) with the oil and the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds begin to pop (you’ll hear little popping sounds), add the onion.Once the onion has started to soften, add in the ginger, garlic and chilli, cook down until the onion starts to brown slightly.Add in the cumin seeds and gently cook for another 2 minutes.Add the spices – turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder and garam masala. Cook these down on a medium to low heat for a couple of minutes just to take the harshness out. Once you see the oil separating from the “masala mix” you can now add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz.Fold in the beans with the mixture until it is thoroughly mixed through and coated. Bring to a simmer, add a couple knobs of butter and mix well.Coarsely chop the coriander, move the Heinz beans to a bowl and garnish.Find out more about Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e06b51429a66ca514214df0e2f8504b7310635a/0_0_8525_5115/master/8525.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6c1abce408cf069503c50ec1a7f413","title":"no posh bread no fancy cheese and certainly no mayo the seven unwritten rules of eating baked beans","story":"From that initial cold forkful to just the right amount of cheese, we’ve settled it – this is how you should be enjoying your beansForget whether the dress was blue or white, or if there was room for Jack on that floating debris – the most heated debates of our generation revolve around food. Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

My mum used to bake bread. I can still remember waking up to the smell of her amazing little crusty rolls. We’d have them with crispy bacon, eggs and baked beans and that was just a little plate of joy to start the day. I can still taste it when I think about it.Mum’s from Antigua and beans are also a big part of Caribbean cooking. Rice and peas, which is really rice and beans, is one of my favourite things. It’s so comforting, it’s like the Caribbean version of mashed potatoes. Then you put curried goat or chicken or fried fish on it – or just more beans. If you’re tired or lonely, sad or happy – whatever it is – rice and peas will generally sort it out.These days I’ve become more aware of sugar in dishes. A honey glaze here, something else there and, before you know it, you’ve pushed the sugar levels way up. For me it’s all about balance now. And low-sugar products are great for that.You can also bring out sweetness using existing foods on your plate, for example when you’re cooking your onions or leeks, let them go for longer because they create their own sweetness as they caramelise. It takes a while to adjust to that different kind of sweetness but it really works. Or add some cumin and a little salt to carrots and roast them to enhance their sweetness.It’s no surprise to me that beans are such a mainstay of so many cultures. Brazil has feijoada – black beans and pork stew. Families come together and add farofa, a toasted cornmeal, to it. And think of pasta e fagioli in Italy. There’s a familiar heartiness that beans evoke for me and historically they’re a food that people without much money could afford.We see them as humble but forget how versatile they are. They’re a brilliant carrier of flavour and add real depth and ballast to a plate. They’re a kind of security food. When I became a mother, I’d send my kids to school on beans on toast because I knew it was going to last and fill them the right way. My daughter Miquita was also a big fan of my cheesy baked beans. It was a kind of Welsh rarebit with a bit of Worcester sauce, all bubbling under the grill with silky beans and crusty bread underneath.The most exciting thing in cooking is when you take something people think of as humble and transform it into something really delicious and surprising. People forget the ways they can use the tin of beans in the cupboard – they’re haricots in tomato sauce, which is the basis of so many dishes. That’s why I came up with this recipe, which combines pork and beans – an age-old combination. Watch any cowboy film and that’s what they’re eating.In this dish, I use tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz to pair with the pork the creaminess of the beans and the salty, spiciness of the pork just makes me really happy. Then you get amazing sweetness from the leek and garlic running through it all.A hearty recipe that’s bound to satisfy – if you’re making it for kids you can go easy on the chilli.

Take the pork belly, slip it into an ovenproof dish, rub in all the spices, then pour in the stock. Cover with tinfoil, and place in the oven for at least 90 minutes, and up to 120 minutes – the meat needs to be very tender so that when you test with a skewer or small knife it is soft. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a board or rack to cool it down. Reserve the cooking juices left in the pan as well. Take the meat and pull it apart or roughly chop it up. As with the juices, leave to one side.Take a good heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter, add the oil, then all of the other ingredients except the beans. Soften the ingredients very gently over a low heat for about 40 minutes, until they are very soft and caramelised. Add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, pour in the cooking juices from the pork belly.

Crisp and crunchy fish and chips, juicy burgers on the barbecue and decadent chocolate brownies are simply too much of a temptation, no matter that you’ve promised to be good this week. But you don’t have to choose between health and hankering after a little indulgence: we’ve rewritten the cookbook to give five comfort foods a healthier summer makeover.Using simple swaps we’ve reduced the salt, sugar and fat content of some of our favourite family meals, as well as increasing the vitamin and mineral content with a few extra portions of veg. What’s more – there’s no compromise on flavour.Here’s how to have your cake and eat it (and your chips, and your fry-up …).Healthier burger and chips Adding grated carrot or courgette to your favourite burger recipe is a savvy way to cut the fat content and increase your daily veg intake – and it keeps burgers moist on the barbecue too.Grate the vegetables finely, squeeze out as much liquid as you can, and stir in to lean mince, adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce and an egg to hold it all together. Cook the burgers on the barbecue, a griddle or in a frying pan, depending on the weather, and pile them up with plenty of tomatoes, crunchy lettuce and pickles.For healthier chips, cut large potatoes into thick fingers, boil them for four minutes and then roast in a hot oven with a drizzle of olive oil for 30 minutes or until golden. Less grease, less guilt – and lots of grinning faces around the table.Start by roasting sausages with sliced red onion, small cubes of sweet potato and a drizzle of oil in a hot oven. After about 20 minutes, or when the potatoes soften and the sausages are almost cooked through, add baby tomatoes on the vine, a handful of sliced flat-cap mushrooms and a few thyme sprigs, and bake for another 10 minutes. Make eight small gaps in the tray crack eggs into four of the holes and spoon Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz into the others, then bake for four minutes until the egg whites are set and the beans are warmed through. Serve with toast and a pot of tea.Feelgood fish and chipsReplace your normal fish-batter recipe with this healthier egg-based version – it’s salt free and cooks well in the oven. Not only are you increasing the protein content of this family favourite but by avoiding the deep-fat fryer you’ll cut down the fat content considerably.Whisk one egg white until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the broken yolk, adding lemon zest and finely chopped parsley. Dip two cod fillets into the egg-white batter and bake at 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6 for 15 minutes until the batter is crisp and the fish is cooked through. Serve with healthier oven-cooked chips, see recipe above, and minty crushed peas or with a big green salad.Guilt-free chocolate browniesIt’s a universal fact that the ultimate chocolate brownie should be dense and fudgy on the inside, with a slightly crisp top for complete satisfaction. The big secret is that this can be achieved without a lot of butter and sugar!Tinned black beans or sweet potato work wonderfully in chocolate brownies, as they have a natural sweetness and a fudgy texture that stands up to the dark chocolate. For black bean brownies, replace the butter with a tin of beans and a little oil. And replace the sugar with maple syrup. For the sweet potato option, use two large sweet potatoes cooked and mashed and 14 dates to replace the butter and sugar respectively.A more unusual substitution is mayonnaise. Swap out butter for your favourite low cal mayo and you’ll get the same rich, gooey brownie but with less fat and fewer calories.Alternative beans on toastYes, beans on toast covered in melted cheese can solve most of your problems, but there are healthier ways to get the same hit. This baked-bean quesadilla is a fun, Mexican twist on a teatime treat and has all the beany-cheesy goodness but less sugar, salt and fat. Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz count as one of your five a day, and they’re naturally low in fat, with no added sugars, artificial colours, flavours or preservatives, which makes them a healthier alternative for all the family.Heat up a portion of the beans and then microwave two wholewheat flour tortillas for 15 seconds, or until warm. Spoon the hot beans over one tortilla using a slotted spoon so you don’t get too much sauce (no one wants soggy tortillas), and mash the beans lightly with a fork. Sprinkle with low-fat feta cheese, fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime, then put the other tortilla on top. Cut into four and serve with a big green salad, and a slightly smug feeling on the side.While you might not be able to stop the cravings, you can transform your food with a few healthy swaps – like using Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, sneaking in some extra vegetables, or getting creative with your cooking.Find out more about Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/495f8014ea7897bff6f42d836dacaed9e9148bb9/0_87_3744_2245/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f9bb49a49d9841c2d0caa16aaedb0ae","title":"government legal action refusal to publish sage minutes lockdown","story":"A millionaire businessman is launching legal action against the government after it refused to disclose minutes of the Sage meetings that informed its decision to impose the coronavirus lockdown.Simon Dolan, who owns Jota Aviation, said he received an unsatisfactory response to his challenge over the legality of the lockdown in a “letter before action” sent two weeks ago.He and his lawyers intend to go to the high court to seek permission for an urgent judicial review of the background to the lockdown imposed on 23 March. He had sought to obtain minutes from meetings of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage).“We are pressing ahead with the case and expect to be heard within the next 10 days or so,” Dolan said. “I believe it is absolutely crucial in holding the government to account – they have introduced entirely unprecedented restrictions on basic freedoms, caused the losses of millions of jobs, destroyed businesses, incurred eye-watering amounts of debt, which will take generations to pay back, and yet they refuse to share the basic information they say they rely on to make these devastating decisions.”His lawyers have argued that the lockdown was ultra vires – outside of legal authority – because it implemented regulations under the Public Health Act 1984 instead of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 or the emergency Coronavirus Act 2020.They have also argued that the lockdown, which must be reviewed every three weeks, was reimposed on a “disproportionate” basis in law, using an “over-rigid” test regarding its effect on containing the disease but not its impact on the economy, jobs and wider health and third, that it breached the European convention on human rights covering the right to liberty, family life, education and property.Dolan was seeking disclosure of the minutes of Sage meetings this year to give the government the opportunity to fully explain its justifications for the five tests Boris Johnson has set out for lifting the lockdown.Dolan says he is not opposed to the lockdown in principle, but to what he describes as a “totalitarian” approach involving lack of transparency over Sage advice and other key government advice.The government has been widely criticised in the last week for the lack of clarity in its lockdown guidelines. Scotland and Wales are continuing to tell residents to “stay at home”, while Boris Johnson has relaxed the message in England.Johnson is also under pressure after epidemiological models suggested transmission rates in London were now half those  in north-east England and Yorkshire, raising the question of whether all areas would be safe to emerge from lockdown at the same time.The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089782bceca71ce51ddbcd0af76a0cb8c01923e6/0_104_4985_2991/master/4985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7480c9d2dd7a4ed9d2eb9e7821dbd121","title":"and heres the kitchen garden cooped up britain moves the indoors outdoors","story":"As lockdown forces us to use every inch inside our homes, those lucky enough to have outside space are going al-frescoA bench and a slightly wobbly table used to be adequate for sitting and eating outside on warm days. Now the vogue is to turn your garden into a sophisticated outdoor living room, with rugs, cushions, scented candles and fire pits. “Outdoor living rooms are not a new idea, but it’s definitely a huge thing for 2020,” said Ann-Marie Powell, a garden designer. “People are desperate to utilise whatever space they have at the moment, from a big garden to a tiny urban balcony, to help them stay sane in lockdown.”For the first time since 1913, apart from during the two world wars, the show will not take place in the grounds of the Royal Hospital this year.

Our West Highland terrier, Ziggy, who had travelled the world with us, was rapidly declining.She’d beaten the odds three times following the discovery of a mass on her bladder which was finally confirmed as cancer. But in the space of a few months she’d gone from accompanying us on 10km runs to struggling to walk, unable to pee and poo easily, her quality of life rapidly declining.We’d decided we wanted to be with her when she was euthanised – the kindest thing to do, our vet told us – but by that time in March that service was in short supply.The best option we could find was for the procedure to be performed in a quiet part of a vet’s car park in Epping Forest. It felt grim to contemplate. But in the end it was painfully moving, her last moments spent curled up between us as we sat on the ground, her chin resting in my lap.It is perhaps why, last week, the television gardener Monty Don’s response to the loss of his own dog Nigel triggered a jolt of recognition. “What he had,” said Don, “was this absolute sense of purity. He exuded an unsullied innocence. We all love our dogs but I’ve had lots of dogs and he was special it’s very hard to put your finger on it.”Amid the sadness, these days there is also a feeling of guilt. A sense somehow that – real as it is – it is wrong to be feeling grief for a dog at a time when so many others are losing friends and family.The dog thing came late for me. I just about remember our childhood English bull terrier, Fanny, a stage dog my father adopted while he was working in the theatre after she was fired for biting members of the cast of Oliver!Ziggy, though, arrived in my late 40s, and became a firm fixture in our lives, accompanying us everywhere, including on a four-year stint as the  and Observer’s correspondent in Jerusalem.Now, he was gone. And suddenly we were without a dog.Scientists and psychologists are still edging towards understanding the strange and millennia-old relationship between dogs and humans. On the animals’ side of things, the picture is reasonably clear: the grey wolf, from which all breeds of domesticated dogs descended, already had a highly evolved, sophisticated and social brain. And, as dogs became domesticated, that brain appears to have acquired a sensitivity towards the human gaze and body language that allowed for training. But, beyond the developing utilitarian function of dogs, the human draw to make canines their pets has prompted competing explanations.As Marta Borgi and Francesca Cirulli of the department of behavioural neuroscience at the Istituto Superiore di Sanità in Rome suggested in a paper in Frontiers in Psychology: “Why animals constitute such an attractive stimulus for humans has not been completely clarified.“Living beings engage the attention of people more than objects do, and it has been hypothesised that the evolutionary reason behind this response is that paying attention to other living beings is significant for inidual fitness.”Other theories have been posited. One suggests that we feel a greater attraction to species that are closer to us on the genetic family tree or that are similar in behavioural or cognitive ways.Then there is the long-established notion of Kindchenschema or “baby schema”, which suggests humans are attracted specifically to animals that display “cute” or infantile features with a large head and obvious eyes, although recent MRI studies of brain activation patterns in women viewing facial images of their own child and own dog suggested different responses.And while many of those specialising in the field have sought to avoid the use of the word “friendship” in response to animal-human relationships, Borgi and Cirulli embrace it.“In our opinion ‘friendship’ appears to be the most suitable word to describe close human-pet relationships, which imply the formation of a social bond that serves analogous emotional and adaptive functions as human-human friendships,” they write.“Most of the properties that a relationship should have in order to be characterised as friendship are traceable in the human-pet association: intimacy, companionship, trust, loyalty, commitment, affection, acceptance, sympathy, concern for the other’s welfare, as well as time spent together and maintenance of the pair bond after long separations.”Perhaps, as the Pulitzer-winning poet Mary Oliver wrote in Dog Talk, the end piece essay for the collection Dog Songs, some of the attachment relates to the way in which canines occupy a middle space between the wild and the tame worlds, interpreting that other place for us.“Some things are unchangeably wild, others stolidly tame … There are wild things that have been altered, but only into a semblance of tameness, it is no real change. But the dog lives in both worlds.”But it is Don’s comment about “unsullied innocence” that resonates the most with me. After Ziggy’s death a friend suggested that what we see in our dogs are “hairy little saints”. And in a time of such uncertainty, our social bonds disrupted, it is perhaps this that people are seeking.Last week a new dog arrived in our lives. Mindful of the “hairy saint” description we’ve called him Bodhi, meaning “awakened,” although into what dog world we’ll never know. It is always an emotional contract, entered into, as Oliver puts it, in the knowledge of our dogs’ brief time on earth.“It is exceedingly short, his galloping life. Dogs die so soon … We would do anything to keep them with us, and to keep them young. The one gift we cannot give.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4401bd746ece20393b1425f8873cd9ba676010cc/680_1427_3531_2119/master/3531.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=852bebda249cb538dbc4cdcc47e6ab22","title":"our baby was born then coronavirus lockdown began","story":"We always knew a baby would mean a change of gear. But we’ve had a crash course in an old-fashioned way of feeding a family Before coronavirus I was eating out around 10 times a week. Sometimes more, if I felt like I was wasting away, or less, if my doctor sister had texted me about diabetes again. It wasn’t just gluttony. I write about restaurants. And it wasn’t always the grande bouffe. Sometimes just soup. Sounds defensive, doesn’t it? It looks excessive from our new vantage point.That lifestyle came shuddering to a halt at the start of March. Our daughter Lily was born on 11 March. Then the lockdown began. I haven’t been to a restaurant for nearly two months. Other critics have written heartbroken paeans to their former sweethearts. Not me. In fact, the longer the lockdown goes on, the more I wonder whether I miss them at all. The past few weeks have been a crash course in an old-fashioned version of sustenance. We plan meals, shop for ingredients, cook them ourselves. I feed wife, wife feeds daughter, nobody starves, I get to feel useful.We are working our way through recipes we’ve been meaning to try. Fuchsia Dunlop’s Sichuan recipes couldn’t have been easier. There was an hour’s wait to get into Waitrose, but no queue at the Asian supermarket down the road.We always knew the baby would mean a change of gear. Lockdown has made it more intense. We are cocooned, the three of us, in our new world. If it weren’t for the virus I would be leaving the house during the daytime, getting my parenting in at nights and around the edges.Instead, the three of us are around all the time, orbiting each other in a small space working, walking, cleaning, feeding, changing nappies. It should probably be more fraught. But it is a peaceful life, where the choices are basically reduced to “what would you like to eat today?”, a vision of a quieter existence that will end soon. I know we are lucky. When so many people are enduring such hardship, it’s awkward to admit I will treasure these strange days, when food is just food but much more than that, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa555635facb4dcdcdda8eb8a17373c5829bebb/1315_162_3235_1941/master/3235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b6865cf382595569cdd18d008dc65bd","title":"ruth hunt at oxford i found other girls wjho liked girls cheap alcohol and smoking","story":"The LGBTQ+ campaigner, 40, talks about growing up gay, becoming a baroness and still longing for a cigaretteScrewing up was never an option. My parents instilled a strong work ethic in me, both coming from working-class backgrounds. I spent my childhood in Cardiff working hard, getting good GCSEs and then going to Oxford University. I think that’s why we all struggled with my sexuality through that time: we worried that it risked everything.A lot happened when I was 12. I was hit by a car, realised I was gay and my aunt died during childbirth leaving behind three young children. Like every teenager I thought I knew how to cope when I didn’t. I only started being kinder to myself in my 30s.Oxford made me less studious. I found other girls who liked girls, cheap alcohol on tap and the freedom to smoke out of my bedroom window.Give me an audience of 5,000 and I’ll make a speech that connects with every single person, but I find intimate, casual conversations in small groups difficult. I’m the introvert who finds small talk excruciating.It is bollocks that women only succeed if they adhere to a soft idea of femininity.

I cut my hair shorter and bought some beautiful new ties.I used to think equality progressed in a linear fashion, but it goes in fits and starts. Our own anxiety is so intrinsically linked to how we feel about others that it’s rarely a one-directional journey.Trans women are women, trans men are men and non-binary people are valid. The ease with which we dehumanise them is terrifying. I receive more hateful abuse from people who take issue with this than I’ve ever had from homophobes. Aged only 40 and unequivocally a dyke, finding myself a baroness in the House of Lords is unexpected. It was a big decision to accept, but I see it as my duty. Receiving letters addressed to “Baroness Hunt of Bethnal Green” does tickle me.I spent a long time being angry with organised religion, but I believe in God. Catholicism can be a leveller: the church thinks we’re all sinners, so LGBTQ+ people don’t rate as highly on their hit list.If you can give up smoking, you can do anything. It took me five years. Whenever I think I can’t do something, I remember: I quit. I still dream about smoking, though, and if the world was ending, I’d grab a packet of cigarettes.

The industry responded quickly, first by putting archive shows online (many of them available free of charge) and then by creating specially commissioned works, online festivals, and other ingenious ways to keep audiences connected to venues.Seven weeks on, there is a blizzard of theatre being streamed online. The new work is mainly in the form of monologues, filmed by the actor in some cases. These were initially quick-response dramas, rough around the edges, but have grown far slicker. Some companies are using technology in inventive ways too, such as interactive theatre on Zoom.I have spoken to writers, actors and artistic directors who are thinking hard about ways to adapt but there is grave concern about funding and future survival, and sometimes I have felt a lump in my throat after an interview. But a lot of them have pointed out that this is an imaginative art form so will find ways to survive. I think it is true, though live theatre might look and feel different when it is back.Reviewing theatre from my sofa rather than the stalls is not the same thing. Being in the room gives you an intensity of focus and it demands continuous attention. At home I can press pause or rewind, and that changes everything.I don’t feel the nervous thrill of an overnight deadline either because I am now often watching a show in the daytime, and have far longer to write. I hadn’t quite realised that turning around a review inside 12 hours is something I find hugely exciting. If Covid-19 had hit 20 years ago, the film industry and the life of the film critic would have been knocked sideways. Closing cinemas and video stores would have meant no new films coming out, and releasing them straight to DVD would involve mail order, an unreliable and unappetising option. Reviews on that basis would have been all but impossible.But streaming technology – which took off around 2006 – has changed that. Now the industry has found that people in lockdown have a huge appetite for new films on streaming services, and critics can watch the films themselves a week or so in advance on their laptops. So although some big-ticket items like James Bond have been delayed and international film festivals this year pretty much cancelled, film critics carry doggedly on, watching films on their laptops. Actually, they were doing that with one or two films a week anyway. I’m only being semi-facetious when I say that a Thursday night clapping session should be devoted to the people who keep Britain’s wifi going.What the lockdown has meant is that the film critic’s life has become lonelier, more isolated— although also, arguably, more thoughtful. We used to see movies on the big screen, often with loads of other people. Film watching was a part of professional life and also part of a bustlingly social real life. In many ways, it’s a triumph that cinema has carried on. But the real danger is that commercial success for streamed movies will mean that studios will be less interested in cinema releases after the lockdown, and that home-streaming will become, if not the new normal, then increasingly the new more-possible. But film critics will be very glad to get out of their lockdown — and back inside the darkness of a cinema.On one level, lockdown hasn’t changed my working life too dramatically: I’ve spent 20 years working from home. But on the other, there are no gigs to review, and fewer albums: opinion seems ided as to whether it’s better to press on with releases as planned or put release dates back in the hope things will have returned to something like normality by the time the album comes out. There are no face-to-face interviews, and I hate using Zoom or FaceTime. Conversation always seems incredibly stilted on them, as if people haven’t quite learned yet how to behave naturally. Or maybe they’re just horrified by my appearance after eight weeks without a visit to the barbers, which is fair enough.And depressingly, the shortfall in interviews and reviews has been more than made up for by a surge in obituaries and posthumous appreciations.I have no idea what the future holds for the music industry, and frankly nor does anyone else: everything you hear or read on the subject is just conjecture, no matter how authoritative its tone seems. I don’t see an industry predicated on mass gatherings getting to back to normal in a hurry. There’s a theory that festivals and major tours aren’t going to restart in earnest until 2022. What happens in the interim is anyone’s guess: I’ve heard predictions of everything from financial apocalypse to an explosion of creativity unbridled by the usual rules which no longer apply. But no one knows. That’s one of the hardest things about life at the moment: the not knowing.I started self-isolating about two weeks before lockdown. It wasn’t a vast change to my normal lifestyle and it made me feel better not to have to think of myself as a potential mass murderer every time I went out. But when lockdown was announced, even though my physical state didn’t change, my emotional state took a similar knock to everyone else’s. And having the pestilence “officially” confirmed – well, no matter how happily introverted in ordinary times, no matter how much dystopian fiction you have read (or viewed), it turns out that it’s still a bit of a facer when it comes.I can work under almost any circumstances because it has always been my salvation and because I’m lucky enough to love what I do. I’ve filed columns hours after being sacked, after finding out a friend had died, and throughout a fairly hefty bout of post-natal depression. And I found I could still, just about. TV reviews were still doable, but as time has gone on they have had to be written during ever-smaller gaps, between homeschooling, meal-assembly three times a day, crying with rage after government briefings, fatigue after anxiety-dream-ridden nights, and fear for my parents. My dad, and so effectively my mother too, have been shielding from the beginning and a few weeks ago he was diagnosed with early stomach cancer as well, which is extremely thoughtless of him. I hope my writing’s quality (whatever it was to begin with) hasn’t dropped – if it has then I can only apologise and promise that I’m doing my best. It’s all, unless we’re purporting to lead the country, any of us can do.The truest piece of criticism I’ve read since lockdown was by Jay Rayner. He wrote about the joy of eating sausages from the fridge as an example of the comforts we should allow ourselves in these challenging times.I wish I could write about art like that – as something simple and reassuring in which we can all find solace. Art isn’t always like that. It can be sophisticated, controversial, difficult - the opposite of a hearty banger.But it can also touch the deepest wellsprings of fear and hope. I’m trying as a critic to draw attention to such art, in these times that remind us how mortal we are. In a forthcoming project for  Documentaries we explore the tragic art of Rembrandt and Rothko, the ecstatic sunrises of Monet and Turner, finding resources of inspiration as well as portrayals of pain.I think the best thing a critic can do now is point to art that strengthens. It’s impressive how many artists are producing such images. Tracey Emin made a video diary with her usual direct honesty. Gilbert and George shared a very different insight into their besuited lockdown. And David Hockney is doing his best work in years, depicting spring in his French garden in colours of joy. Art can be as good as a sausage after all.Back-to-back building tours, hasty previews of unfinished exhibitions, the frantic dash around the opening days of the Venice Biennale – with all of that wiped off the calendar, the pandemic has provided a useful time to pause and slow down.Visiting new buildings may be off limits for the foreseeable future, but that means we can train our sights on the unbuilt – such as the alarming proposals for Gateshead Quays, which otherwise might have slipped under the radar. The last few weeks have also allowed space to zoom out and look more deeply at some broader topics, whether that’s the murky mechanics of the housebuilding industry, or the startling career of the unsung Irish designer Eileen Gray.The pandemic has spawned its own plethora of material too, from designers coming up with Covid-fighting solutions , to the host of temporary structures popping up across the world , to wider questions about how our cities might adapt if the virus is here to stay. Ultimately, the lockdown has had a clarifying effect, exposing our stark urban inequalities and making clear the urgent need to improve housing space standards and prioritise streets for walking and cycling. As critics, we must fight to ensure that these lessons are heeded, and we don’t just go back to business as usual when it’s all over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ce2a04eb9a82b8d3fc96eb26f9b7653bc7e4285/0_515_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=732f0110424b4bdcbee3003ee363739c","title":"charli xcx how im feeling now review show and tell turned up to 11","story":"The ‘workaholic party animal’ has, under the glare of social media, put together the ultimate lockdown albumA level of mystique has long surrounded how musicians bottle their magic. In 2015, PJ Harvey – a fiercely private British artist – exposed the recording of her Hope Six Demolition Project to public view at London’s Somerset House, workshopping the songs behind one-way glass.Fast-forward five years, and Charli XCX – fiercely public British artist Charlotte Aitchison – has released an album written, recorded, produced and art-directed in the space of a few weeks, with unprecedented levels of real-time scrutiny via social media. The only pre-Covid song here is party4u, a previously unreleased fan favourite.Not only has How I’m Feeling Now been created at warp speed and under lockdown restrictions – handily the Hertfordshire-raised singer lives lives in Los Angeles with her two managers and her boyfriend, Huck Kwong, who is good with a camera – but the 27-year-old Aitchison has turned the notion of creative show-and-tell up to 11. She has effectively taken ownership of “the lockdown album” (see the release schedule for the next 24 months).Fan interaction is nothing new. Most stars keep fans engaged through social media, typically teasing snippets of unreleased music. Memes abound.Aitchison has gone further, establishing an email address for would-be producers to send beats to, airing lyrics-in-progress and screenshots of texts with collaborators. She’s hosted Zoom meetings with fans, posted updates from her bathroom, focus-grouped her output via her socials. On 21 April, Aitchison reported she had cried because she was putting too much pressure on her collaborators. Last Monday, a clip on her Instagram feed demonstrated how she was stitching together vocals (“comping”) for another tune, 7 Years.If the process has been dizzying to witness – how Aitchison continues to sustain her Apple Music Beats 1 show, interviews, and the personal upkeep of several social feeds alongside music-making is a mystery – the results have been highly effective.Claws – a hyper-digital earworm – came out a fortnight ago, its title chosen by fans. The playful video was shot on a home green screen (de rigueur among YouTubers). It’s a tune Aitchison might have done anyway with producer Dylan Brady (of 100 Gecs), but more DIY. Surprisingly, given that Aitchison’s posturing tunes often mirror her hard-partying lifestyle, Claws is a love song. “I love, I love, I love everything about you,” she sings.Having clocked up a number of conventional hits a few years ago, Aitchison now specialises in acrylic, outre, influencer club-pop, abetted by producer AG Cook (in Montana with “bad wifi”, but co-exec producer nonetheless). Her celebrated 2019 album, Charli, took some confident strides back towards the mainstream with blowsy tracks like White Mercedes and guests like Haim and Christine and the Queens. Before lockdown, Aitchison told an interviewer that she’d been working on music that felt “very polished, very structured”.How I’m Feeling Now is light on guests (purposely so) and polish. It returns to the gleeful disruption of her more ear-bleeding work, while piling on sing-song tunes. And if the interactivity of this record is, perhaps, limited to fans passing judgment on artwork, the overriding impression is that How I’m Feeling Now is truly a work of its time – not just the Covid era, with its own Dogme-like parameters – but the always-on feedback loop of output and comments that goes with creative culture now.Aitchison’s work is explicitly not for everyone it aggressively foregrounds its own artifice. A song like Detonate calls on arpeggiating synths, 8-bit video game sounds and the bleeping of a detonator. In this corner of club-pop, which takes cues from trap and K-pop, skull-drilling repetition is a feature, not a bug.Aitchison has never specialised in over-intellectualisation, preferring bangers that live in the giddy moment. Pink Diamond (“I just wanna go real hard”) is all icy drama. Anthems, too, boasts OTT rave stabs (and the faintest impression of Basement Jaxx). It’s a paean to partying, with added self-knowledge. In all this lairiness you find occasional admissions that Aitchison is trying to fill some void. Another song, C2.0, is an ode to how she is missing “her clique” of all these tracks, it sounds the most thrown-together.If these songs are more off the cuff than before, nothing here sounds unprofessional. Some lyrics have not exactly been sweated-over – “I love you forever, even when we’re not together,” goes Forever – but they chime with people feeling acutely separated from loved ones.The song is, of course, another heart emoji to Kwong. It’s not the last. “You love me even when I hate myself, I’m sure,” intones an Auto-Tuned Aitchison on I Finally Understand, whose excellent bouncy beat comes from producer Palmistry 7 Years is a hydraulic ballad that s Aitchsion and Kwong’s long onoff affair.In a Zane Lowe interview, Aitchison remarked that her and Kwong’s relationship had been physically and emotionally distant prior to lockdown. Quarantine had brought them closer. “How do you express that you’re in love with someone 10 different times on an album without just sounding sycophantic?” she joked. If the title flags its own diaristic intentions, How I’m Feeling Now reflects this workaholic party animal’s gratitude for love.How I’m Feeling Now is out now via AtlanticAsylum.

That is why I have decided not to contest the forthcoming elections within Momentum and instead will hand over to a new leadership.”He continued: “We desperately need better governance in our party, as the leaked report has further demonstrated. Members need justice for sabotage, misuse of funds, plus racist, sexist, ableist and frankly McCarthyite attitudes.“But we must also make sure that the party’s machinery never again returns to those days of anti-democratic stitch-ups, factional warfare, and toxic culture.”The longtime campaigner, who studied economics at Cambridge in the 1970s, notably worked on Corbyn’s campaign for the party leadership in 2015 which culminated in the unlikely return of a socialist to the role.He wrote that upon Corbyn becoming leader, socialists were few in the Labour party, but “today we are many” and there was “real cause amongst us for hope and confidence”.Lansman added: “In 2017, with an incredibly popular socialist manifesto, we achieved the biggest swing to Labour since 1945. Promising to restore public ownership and end austerity, we came within just 2,500 votes across a handful of constituencies from forming a government.”He credited the movement around Corbyn, bolstered by Momentum’s grassroots campaigning and viral videos, for forcing Labour to “never again be the party of illegal invasions, anti-immigration mugs or support for Tory policies of austerity and privatisation”.However, he lamented that the NEC was unfit for purpose and said it needed to be given greater powers to provide adequate scrutiny and oversight over the party and its leadership. It comes after he was campaign chief of Rebecca Long-Bailey’s unsuccessful run for leadership, in which she lost out to Keir Starmer.Long-Bailey tweeted Lansman her best wishes, describing him as a “tireless voice for Labour party democracy”.Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, also tweeted to wish Lansman all the best, calling him “a true socialist” who “has fought injustice and inequality and will continue to do so”.Of the attempts – sometimes controversial – to reselect parliamentary candidates in certain constituencies by leftwing activists, Lansman wrote: “We didn’t succeed in democratising the party sufficiently while Jeremy was leader, but we must not give up now. It’s now more important than ever that Labour becomes a grassroots member-led movement.”Acknowledging he had made mistakes and had some regrets – without revealing what they were – Lansman said the struggle for an equal and environmentally sustainable world would continue, though there has been speculation about whether Momentum can survive Corbyn’s departure.“I shall stay around to support my successors in Momentum,” he said. “I shall continue to speak out, even when some would rather I didn’t.”He added that he would return to blogging and focus his attentions on Labour’s national executive committee.A spokesperson for Momentum thanked Lansman for his years of dedication to the Labour party, saying: “He has done an incredible amount to transform the politics of this country. He has played a key role in building Labour into a half-a-million-member party and strengthening the movement for socialism in Britain.“We look forward to working with him as he continues to lead from the left on the NEC and across the movement.” The Forward Momentum campaign, which set out last month to “refound” and “democratise” Momentum, said it was pleased Lansman had recognised it was time for a new generation to take the organisation forward.“We need to put an end to stitch-ups, and candidates or slates being chosen behind closed doors in London,” it said in a statement. “We need Momentum to be a truly member-led organisation that campaigns to transform the Labour party and supports trade unions and social movements in their struggles for social and economic justice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/736861a006daf940a96b83c92c9b74ccfeb27062/38_59_3401_2041/master/3401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1413f6de8191f38357057548ab66364e","title":"thatcherite thinktanks back increase public spending in lockdown","story":"Free-market bodies support the government’s ramping up of debts to confront the Covid-19 outbreak  • Coronavirus – latest updates• See all our coronavirus coverageBritain’s leading free-market thinktanks, which backed Margaret Thatcher’s tax-cutting and privatisation agenda and sanctioned the last 10 years of austerity, have lent their support to the government’s plans for unprecedented and sustained increases in public spending.In a shift of stance that will give Rishi Sunak political clearance to ramp up UK debts to levels not seen in peacetime, the Adam Smith Institute, the Centre for Policy Studies, the Institute of Economic Affairs and Policy Exchange said they endorsed public spending increases to confront the coronavirus outbreak and state-funded investment to boost the recovery.The support for widespread state intervention to rescue the economy came as Boris Johnson told backbench Tory MPs there were no plans to impose a public sector wage freeze or other austerity measures to bring down public spending in the crisis.In a call to around 125 members of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, the Daily  reported that the prime minister said there was “no question” of a return to austerity, and assured them he would “double down” on funding transport projects in the north of England.Johnson addressed MPs after a leaked Treasury memo revealed that some officials were putting in place detailed plans for spending cuts to arrest a public sector deficit expected to climb by at least £300bn this year.Left-leaning thinktanks and academics have lined up to condemn plans for a return to austerity, saying it would harm the recovery, and adding that further government borrowing would be needed to secure a return to growth after the virus-induced mothballing of the economy.During the last recession, most free market thinktanks buttressed austerity measures imposed by the then chancellor George Osborne, arguing that the public sector deficit should be quickly reduced.Warwick Lightfoot, chief economist at Policy Exchange, said: “I don’t think anyone is arguing for a relaunch of austerity. Even an austerity hawk believes it is different this time.“The last thing you want to do is amplify the prospects of a full-blown depression,” he added.Policy Exchange, founded in 2002 by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office chief, Tory peer Francis Maude, former MP Nick Boles and businessman Archie Norman, has a loyal following in the cabinet and has claimed to be behind several recent Tory policies.Lightfoot said low interest rates meant the government could borrow cheaply to invest in infrastructure to get the economy back on its feet.Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, founded in the 1970s to promote free-market policies, said: “Even fiscally hawkish people have less of a problem with the current increase in debt levels.”Tom Clougherty, head of tax at the Centre for Policy Studies, said: “I’d usually be wary of big public investment schemes In the current circumstances, though, with borrowing costs very low and little prospect of crowding out private investment, I think the pros outweigh the cons.”The CPS was founded in the 1970s to combat socialism by former MP Keith Joseph, a close friend and supporter of Margaret Thatcher.Echoing left-leaning economists, Lesh said the Bank of England should support the government with loose monetary policy, allowing it to borrow at low interest rates.Julian Jessop, an economics fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs – a thinktank founded in the 1950s with the support of free-market economist Friedrich Hayek – said that he was relaxed about the debts built up during the worst of the lockdown. “There are obvious risks that austerity will restrict growth,” he said.But he was concerned that the government would harm the economy by keeping restrictions on business activity for much of the year, which would delay a bounce-back in economic growth.“The longer the economy is kept shuttered, the greater the risk that more of the damage will be permanent, making it that much harder to pay for better public services and infrastructure in the future,” he said.The four thinktanks continue to believe the Treasury should examine tax-cutting measures to promote innovation and entrepreneurial activity, saying that over the longer term, Whitehall was poor at allocating funds to the economy in the most effective way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03a6aae9d1564259cd81e79bf91ad26be2998274/0_225_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=973c8db6fc87fb891e7066424a00d8aa","title":"charlotte wood what are we really afraid of when we think of old age","story":"In a black-and-white thinking culture, how should we consider the richness of who we are in old age?A few years ago, a pretty young woman approached me in the lunchroom of the building where I began work on my novel, The Weekend.“You’re writing about ageing, aren’t you?” she asked. I was, I said, smiling.She considered my 50 year-old face for a few long seconds before shuddering, “I’m terrified of ageing.”I burst out laughing.But she’s not alone. Looking down the tunnel to old age, it seems we’re all afraid. But of what, exactly? How should we think about growing old?At a dinner I sat next to a darkly witty gerontologist. He was under no illusions about very old age – at one point in our conversation there came some pragmatic deliberation about the best way to kill yourself when the time came. But he was also keen to stamp on a few old-people cliches.He told me of an elderly man brought to an appointment by his children. They were deeply concerned, wanting him assessed for dementia. His major symptom was falling in love with a sex worker, moving her into his house, giving her money and property. The doctor reluctantly put him through rounds of rigorous tests – and found absolutely nothing wrong with his cognition or psychology. He was sane, he was loved, he was happy. The doctor hooted with delight as he told me this story.Later, he asked me: “How many years of your life would you trade for a Booker Prize?”“What?! None!” I replied. I was surprised at the vehemence and speed of my answer, and that I knew it to be absolutely true.Then he asked, “What if they were the years between 85 and 95?”My friend J reports on her mother, very slowly dying in a nursing home. She’s in her late 90s, and so frail her heart has not the strength to push blood to the extremities of her body. Her hands and feet are bloodless, cold. Yet when she’s wheeled into a patch of sunshine in the garden, she smiles with deep, sensual pleasure. “How lovely this is,” she says, with relish. Soaking up the warmth, the sound of the trees moving above her.J’s sister leaves a nursing home visit one day in bleak distress. “I can’t go in there any more,” she says.J agrees that it’s very hard, but is curious: What especially prompted this today?Her sister’s expression is almost angry. “It’s that she just – lies there. She’s so …useless.”Another friend’s mother, also in her 90s, was taken to inspect a potential nursing home. Through a doorway she saw some residents in an exercise class.“What’s wrong with them?” she barked loudly.“Nothing,” her daughter said. “They’re just … old.”“Well,” said the mother viciously, “they look retarded.”A different woman, unwell at 79, needed aqua therapy at a rehab centre but refused to enter the pool. “I’m not getting in that water. It’s full of disgusting old bodies.”Everyone in the pool was visibly younger than she.A man in late middle age invited his 86 year-old father to live with him and his family. It hasn’t worked out well. The son describes the sound of his father’s walker creaking down the hall. “I hate him,” he says.Is this dread of the mirror so deeply rooted in all of us? Is it a biological imperative, to turn away as soon as we catch its reflection?In 2015, a review in an Australian newspaper rebuked Edna O’Brien for her wild, chaotic and (I thought) stupendously adventurous novel, The Little Red Chairs. The reviewer’s main point was not so much that the book was flawed, though it surely is, but more importantly that the cause of these flaws was the author’s advanced age. What I read, between the faux-respectful lines, was an unprinted command to O’Brien: You’re old. You’re embarrassing yourself. Shut up.O’Brien was 85 at the time. Now she’s 89 and her new novel, Girl, about the Nigerian girls abducted by Boko Haram, was published in September 2019.Our predictions for old age foresee an epoch of physical incapacity and psychic misery, in contrast with our vital, flourishing youth. But last night on my couch I spent five minutes scribbling down a list of the troubles that plagued me and those in my social circle – middle class, well educated, well resourced – before we turned 50.The list: Major depression. Anorexia and bulimia. A birth malformation necessitating 15 years of agonisingly painful surgery and follow-up. Panic attacks and agoraphobia. Kidney disease. Broken arms and legs. Chronic, intensifying lung disease. Bipolar disorder leading to job and relationship loss, financial disaster. Endometriosis. Crohn’s disease and irritable bowel syndrome with frequent hospitalisation. Asthma, fatal. Asthma, chronic, multiple hospitalisations. Excruciating erticulitis. Migraines and an inability to hold a job. Severe postnatal depression. HIVAIDs, mostly fatal. Type 1 diabetes and complications. Juvenile arthritis with attendant chronic immobilising pain. Major paranoid psychosis, forced hospitalisation and trauma. Cardiac problems, multiple open-heart surgeries. Schizophrenia causing lifelong inability to work and extreme social isolation. Melanoma. Bowel cancer, fatal. Breast cancer, fatal and non-fatal. Brain cancer, fatal and non-fatal. Stevens-Johnson syndrome caused by medical malpractice. Stomach cancer, fatal. Strokes, locked-in syndrome, fatal. Severe addiction to illegal drugs, alcohol, prescription painkillers. Chronic and acute immobilising pain in spine, knee, neck, foot. Knee and shoulder surgery, severely limiting mobility. High blood pressure. Car accidents, frequently fatal. Farm accidents. Multiple sclerosis. Guillain-Barré syndrome. Suicide attempts. Suicide.After five minutes I stopped scribbling. Excluding a couple of the cancers, almost all of these issues had first occurred before age 30 many have persisted into the fifth and sixth decades. Yet some cognitive dissonance allows us to perceive even long-term disorders in youth as somehow aberrant, manageable and far less horrifying than the potential “degradations” of old age.I recently saw a birthday card carrying the image of a haughtily elegant middle-aged woman in 1950s attire. The caption read, “Honey, you couldn’t pay me to be 20.” I bought it immediately.I was not a happy or a healthy young person. I had chronic asthma exacerbated by smoking I was unfit my diet was ordinary. “Orphaned” by 29, I spent most of my 20s and 30s in grief. I was deeply anxious with little confidence, my fretful neediness causing relationship problems. For many of those years, I cried every week.The day I turned 50, I felt a mysterious surge of what I could only think of as power. A deep optimism, energy and peacefulness took up space inside me. Give or take a few crises since, it hasn’t really left. In my mid-50s I’m physically and emotionally stronger, healthier, more calmly loved and loving, more productive, more organised, smarter, wealthier and exponentially happier than I ever was in my youth. In the past four years I’ve really cried about three times, on one occasion because a good friend died.I mentioned my mid-life happiness at a public event once. A woman in the audience called out cheerfully, “You think it’s great when you’re 50 – wait till you’re 70!”There are global studies showing what’s called “the paradox of age”, a U-curve revealing that from childhood onwards happiness declines, and then dramatically rises. We’re most miserable in our 40s, but things pick up around 50 happiness at 90 far exceeds that at 18. This upswing is partly owing to life experience, but is also a direct result of getting older, say psychologists: “The biological, cognitive and emotional changes of ageing itself … result in better emotional regulation, greater equanimity and compassion, more comfort with ambiguity, deeper gratitude and a focus upon meaningful engagement in the present.”Having published a novel about older women, I’m now seeing evidence of joyful, mischievous ageing everywhere I go. A woman at a book event tells me that at 77, she’d resigned herself to a life that was winding down, finishing up. Instead, she says in astonishment, “I can’t stop the ideas coming. I just have ideas and ideas and ideas!” She motions with both hands outwards from her head, in a delighted gesture of pouring abundance. Her husband sits beside her, beaming.Another day I overhear two women – perhaps they’re 80 – outside a cinema. One tells the other she’s being badgered to visit her daughter, a long drive away in the country. She looks into the middle distance, then says serenely, “I think she wants me to go before I lose my licence.” The two women look at each other for a second, then burst into wild cackles. They gather their bags and stride into the movie house.What am I afraid of, when I think about old age? I’d like to say nothing, but that would be untrue. Dementia, obviously. Relentless physical pain so bad it eclipses small pleasures. Being forced to live with people I dislike. Loss of autonomy. The kind of poverty that destroys autonomy. Unstinting boredom caused by an inability to read or hear.I fear becoming a bitter, self-pitying person. Taking up genealogy. Boring other people to death with my ‘wonderful stories’.What am I not afraid of? Living alone. Being “invisible”. The body’s gradual decline, notwithstanding the above. Death.It’s possible I’m completely deluded. When these things befall me, I’ll probably be terrified.In “Why we can’t tell the truth about ageing”, an article in the New Yorker, Arthur Krystal sneers at the recent proliferation of “feel-good” books about getting older. It’s sheer trendiness to put a positive spin on growing old, Krystal grouches: the truth is, it sucks – please let’s stop the lying.Unconvinced by the U-curve, then.But he has a point. It’s true that alongside the horror and revulsion there has now emerged quite a bit of jolly crusading about the fabulousness of old age. Like Krystal, I too find irksome the anti-ageism books refusing to acknowledge the downsides, those calling for a special new language with which to “celebrate” ageing. Ditto the idiotic, sappy memes that pop up now and then on social media. (Wrinkles are engraved smiles? Jesus Christ.) Nor am I drawn to heartwarming movies in the genre that New York Times critic Neil Genzlinger calls Old People Behaving Hilariously. I cheer when Anjelica Huston sniffs her disdain for “apologetically humble or humiliating” film roles, like one in “an old-lady cheerleader movie”. I’m with you, Anjelica, I think. When I’m 67 I want my work taken seriously, too. But then I see a response from Jacki Weaver, who’s in the old-lady cheerleader movie. When she read Huston’s comments, Weaver says, “I just laughed. And then I said, ‘Well, she can go fuck herself.’”I snort jubilantly into my coffee cup. Go, Jacki. I’m with you, too.Palliative care nurses have told me people almost always die as they live. A person who has lived with acceptance and gratitude will die in gracious acceptance. One who’s lived in bitterness and entitlement and anger will likely die in the same state. Suddenly it’s blindingly obvious to me that ageing is the same all our prior years are practice for the hard stuff of getting old. When I think of the old iniduals I know who express delight and curiosity, a sense of purpose and appreciation, in ordinary daily life, I realise that give or take a few tragedies, they’ve always been this way. It’s their default state. When I think of the unhappiest old people I know – victimised, spiteful, ungrateful for small pleasures, eternally dissatisfied and offended – I look back and see those traits governing their early and middle years too.Note to self: Practise hard.Question to self: When is it too late to change one’s default state?The Good Weekend magazine carries an account of life in a nursing home (“one of the good ones”) by a perceptive retired journalist in his early 80s. He writes brilliantly, the by-line is a pseudonym and the article is gloomy stuff. One of the worst things is enduring mealtimes with a fellow resident as she snatches and grasps, losing her manners, insulting the staff, bullying a vulnerable woman.A week later, a letter appears from an 84-year-old retired pathologist. His experience of residential care, “in an affluent Melbourne suburb”, is much better. Ageing, writes Peter Thomson of Ivanhoe, “is inevitable, inexorable and interesting. AAA rating for ageing: Anticipate, Adapt, Accept”.Ageing is interesting! I keep this letter and think of it often. It might be the most uplifting set of instructions I’ve ever read.It also points to something else that’s scary: positive ageing takes money.My partner and I talk about our Sydney mortgage. Unless suddenly showered with astonishing riches – unlikely – we’ll have paid it off when he turns 78 and I’m 76. I think: we’ll just move to the country. We’ll just move into a bedsit. We’ll just move. As if that will solve everything.When I talk to other people in the arts about “retirement plans”, we laugh grimly. One says hers is to poke out an eye with the car aerial and claim compensation. Another has his sights on a salubrious cardboard box on the median strip as a retirement villa. Nobody has any superannuation to speak of – when the average writer’s income is $11,000 per year, where would it come from?We’ll all just keep working, we say gamely. We’ll keep writing, painting, performing. How could we stop, anyway? We wouldn’t want to stop. We talk about Matisse and his paper cut-outs, Edna O’Brien, Wallace Stegner. Adapting, accepting, but always making, always working.None of us states the obvious: we’re not Matisse, or O’Brien, or Stegner. Nobody talks about what will happen when nobody wants our work any more.In recent years it’s come to me that the point of all our living is to get ready to die. People laugh when I say this out loud. How morbid to think of death all the time! But I don’t find it morbid. I find it interesting, a purposeful exercise, considering how to live – to strive towards living – with that readiness inside us.The Jungian psychologist James Hillman posits that the purpose of human ageing is to fulfil our true character, to become our essential selves. More radically, he suggests that ageing might be “a transformation in beauty as much as in biology”. And then he asks a shocking question: could ageing itself be conceived of as an art form?If it can, then maybe artists can teach us to practise it. Push beyond your first ideas, they might say. Develop a tolerance for solitude, and for failure. Make your mark, defend it, then challenge it, overturn it.Jerry Saltz: “Don’t think good or bad. Think useful, pleasurable, strange.”Walt Whitman: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”Helen Frankenthaler: “I’d rather risk an ugly surprise than rely on things I know I can do.”Jasper Johns: “Take an object. Do something to it. Do something else to it.”I’ve asked what we’re really afraid of, looking ahead to old age. I think the deepest dread is of being reduced, simplified. We’re afraid that, to paraphrase British psychologist and writer Susie Orbach, we’ll be “robbed of the richness of who we are” – our complexity stripped away by forces beyond our control. This reduction is already happening with the cheerleaders on one side, the catastrophisers on the other. Ours is an all-or-nothing, black-and-white-thinking culture we picture ourselves as either relentlessly active, plank posing and Camino walking and cycling into our 90s, or dribbling in a nursing-home chair, waiting for death.But maybe we don’t have to choose either extreme to dwell on. Maybe we can be Anjelica and Jacki be large, contain multitudes. Perhaps, instead of capitulating to reduction, we can keep adding to our concept of how to age – turn our thinking about oldness into an art, and keep exploring it. Doing something to it, and doing something else.This article was first published in Griffith Review 68: Getting On (Text) as Experiments in the Art of Living (ed Ashley Hay)Charlotte Wood is the author of The Natural Way of Things and The Weekend"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bb5447020782f38802856369ddae158754ed347/6_0_4048_2433/master/4048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1323e2545523dbc07bbeeaafdc8823fa","title":"i flew to greece and began solo ivf then the world shut down","story":"Undergoing fertility treatment at any time is a peculiar experience. In the midst of a pandemic, it becomes surrealIt is 7.53am, the last Wednesday in March, and at a courier depot in Athens, the sperm of a Bermudian mechanical engineering student arrives, carried in a nitrogen tank. For the last three days, I have followed the tank’s journey across Europe, loading and reloading the courier website as it made its way from a cryobank in Denmark through Germany to mainland Greece.The continent has been shutting down, borders closing as coronavirus spreads, and as the days have passed, the improbability of this delivery, its chances of ever reaching its destination, have seemed increasingly slim.It has one final leg, a short hop from Athens to the island of Crete. But today is Greek Independence Day, a national holiday, and so all through Wednesday and long into Thursday the sperm waits at the depot. I call the courier company. All planes being grounded, it will travel to its destination by boat, the handler says brightly. “It is very urgent,” I tell her. “It’s for a medical procedure.” She is reassuring but noncommittal. What I do not tell her is that, on Friday, I will have my eggs collected at a fertility clinic on Crete, and it is crucial that the sperm of the engineering student be there to meet them.Undergoing IVF at any time is a peculiar experience. In the midst of a pandemic, it becomes surreal. In early March, as the world shut down, I imagined my scheduled treatment would be postponed, but to my amazement the clinic said it would proceed. And so one Saturday afternoon, as the virus gathered pace and airports acquired a new and fearful mood, I took one of the last flights from London to Heraklion. I was making this trip alone my local health authority does not treat single women.With its own health system buckled by years of austerity, the Greek government had moved quickly to prevent a coronavirus outbreak of the magnitude of those in Italy or Spain. The evening I arrived, 14 March, Greece was on its way to lockdown, and Heraklion’s shops, bars and restaurants stood newly shuttered. I let myself into my rental apartment, ate the kalitsounia left by my host, and wondered what on earth I was doing.For some reason it is always taxi drivers who ask the question, though I imagine they are only voicing what others wonder: “Why don’t you have children?” I suspect many assume I didn’t want to be a mother, that I was too caught up in my career, that I left it too late. None of this is true. Having multiple miscarriages over many years, for which no medical investigation could find a cause, has been an exhausting, distressing and intensely lonely experience. And though my life has been rich and rewarding in many ways, the absence of a child is a sadness that has gnawed the edges of all other joys.When I wake, it is to the sound of wood pigeons, and piano practice, and Sunday church bells. The day is bright and warm, and for some time I wander the city’s empty, sunlit streets. The supermarket is closed, but I find a minimarket to buy a few groceries. Bread, feta, tomatoes. The owner regards me darkly across the counter, locking eyes as he sanitises his hands.So far there are only a handful of cases of the virus on the island. Soon there will be the first death: a German professor visiting the university for a conference. There is no room for tourists now. The swingers’ festival has been cancelled the beaches have closed. They will introduce a mandatory quarantine for new arrivals, close the hotels and the parks. I retreat to the apartment. That night I lie awake, listening to the wind and the cats yowling in the darkness.The clinic is a large, grey, modern building not far from the port. It takes 20 minutes to walk there in the rain, a fierce wind whipping in off the water. At the reception desk, I am told to stand behind a line as they fire a thermometer gun at my head, then permit me to ring the fertility centre doorbell. I fold the sleeve of my jumper over my thumb to press the buzzer.I will admit that I have not read up extensively on IVF. I have taken a strictly need-to-know approach, avoiding online message boards and support groups, spurning offers to bond with friends-of-friends over their own experiences. Each person is different, I have argued, each body is different. Still, as I stand waiting at the door, I realise that this means I have little idea of what to expect.A foreign clinic is disorienting when you are accustomed to another medical system: the rhythms are subtly different, the smells, the light all wrong. I notice the cigarette smoke on the senior nurse’s breath, the junior who chews gum behind her mask as she draws my blood. Even the tourniquet strapped around my arm feels flimsier than back home. “Take a breath,” the nurse says solemnly, as she inserts the needle. She leaves a small trail of blood along my skin, then dispenses the contents of the large syringe into several containers a spring-like gurgling sound that I find oddly hopeful.I walk home along the backstreets, past ageing stucco apartments and the sound of a couple arguing through an open window. When you are not familiar with a culture or a language, your senses become heightened – the colours louder, the sounds and scents more pronounced. I try to notice the details: the hover of wasps over the bowls of water left out for street cats. A snail on a bright blue wall. The firebug on an orange tree. It stops my mind from spiralling. I stop by the supermarket, where they are already limiting the number of customers, and plastic gloves are mandatory. But the shelves are full and no one is stockpiling.The following day, I return to the clinic. My blood test results have proved heartening and my consultant tells me he hopes for 15 or 16 eggs. He chatters warmly as he performs my ultrasound: about his time living in London in the days of disco, the fact that English women never cook. “I like to cook,” I tell him. “What do you cook? Sandwiches?” he asks, then reels off the measurements of my ovaries to his assistant. When I leave, the senior nurse gives me a face mask, ties it tightly so that it covers my nose, and rubs my back with a kind of tenderness. “It’s for you,” she says. “Make sure you wear it.”There is little new I can tell you about IVF medication. The basic protocol is to stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs, which are then removed, fertilised and returned a further array of drugs help make the pregnancy sustainable. And so for the weeks to come my days are measured out in injections, pills and pessaries, in the fiddliness of mixing powders and solutions, of needles and small glass vials. Soon my stomach is puffy and bruised my body feels distorted and misshapen.Meanwhile, I follow news of the pandemic on my laptop. I look at graphs and statistics. I listen to the BBC. Mostly I watch the UK with horror: its slow route to lockdown, the mad rush at the supermarkets, the people who flock to pubs and parks and jostle over toilet roll. There is none of that here. Rather, people move with a kind of quiet obedience. When my flight home is cancelled, I feel something like relief. I feel safe here.On 23 March, Greece grounds all flights to the UK and docks all boats to the islands. I can now only leave the house for an hour each day: to buy groceries, seek medical treatment or take exercise, and must first text the government for permission. A strange serenity settles over these days of confinement: I sleep well and long, read, work, take afternoon walks down to the waterfront. I do not return phone calls from well-meaning friends texts and emails go unanswered. I feel beholden to nothing besides my own body, feed it yoghurt and oranges and sesame snaps. One day I read that IVF clinics around the world are closing, that treatments are being postponed indefinitely, and am filled with a great swell of gratefulness.When I return to the clinic for my second ultrasound, my consultant is in a less jovial mood. He scowls slightly, as if I have disappointed him, tells me the ovarian stimulation has not been as successful as expected he now hopes for five eggs.I am accustomed to sitting in doctors’ offices receiving bad news. To be told repeatedly that you have lost your baby, that there is nothing they can do, that your identical twins have no heartbeat, develops a kind of composure. I have learned how to imperceptibly bite my lip, and close my eyes, and know that the grief will come later, far from here, when it will be solitary and wild and flailing.That I have done all of this alone is testament to what my friends call my terrible taste in men. I have a particular talent for choosing unsupportive partners, men who will ask you to choose between your baby and them, who will miss hospital appointments, and find commitments more pressing than helping you through a miscarriage.Last summer, I sat in my GP’s surgery and told her I wanted to pursue solo IVF. I pressed my fingernails into my palm to steady myself as I spoke. She was supportive and kind, and made a referral to the fertility department at the local hospital.I was not technically single at the time, but two weeks later I left my boyfriend of four years. Some months earlier I had learned that he had cheated on me, constantly, for the entirety of our relationship, including while I was pregnant. I had loved him more than I had loved anybody, and perhaps this was the reason I had tried to make things work, but the days had soon settled into a kind of mute despair.It was liberating to feel in charge of my own destiny again, and for the three months while I waited for my first appointment with the fertility clinic, I felt thrillingly alive. When it came, that appointment was dispiriting: the nurse explained my local health authority’s policy on treating single women. She was sympathetic, ordered a range of fertility tests, cautioned against using a donor I knew, and suggested I look at clinics abroad. “Greece,” she said. “They have some good clinics there.”There followed several months of waiting – for test results, for a round of MMR vaccinations (my GP had no record of my ever having had them). The new year turned and it was almost spring. I told the clinic in Heraklion, chosen for its impressive success rates and peaceful location, that I would come in March. I had not heard of coronavirus then, though already in China the disease was spreading. It seemed very far away. I focused instead on the small, steady world I had created, of fertility acupuncture, sobriety and sperm selection.It is easy to get lost in the process of choosing a sperm donor, to dwell upon academic qualifications, professions, favourite pastimes. The more you pay, the more you know: baby photos, adult photos, voice notes, family medical histories. Some cryobanks will supply handwriting samples and outline drawings of your donor’s face in profile this can have the strange effect of making everyone look like a criminal.Above all, I decided, let him be kind. From hundreds of donors, I whittled it down to two: the mechanical engineering student whose profile was somewhat restrained, but about whom the staff appraisal spoke glowingly and a Danish musician with wavy hair who talked about his love of nature and art. “He sounds like the kind of man I would date,” I told my friends. This was not necessarily a good thing, they pointed out. That night I lay in bed and imagined their profiles being read in the voices of my very worst boyfriends. I chose the engineer.Friday morning, the day of my egg retrieval, and the donor sperm has not arrived. The courier office can tell me only that it has left Athens. I take the coast road to the clinic, walk slowly through the uncertain morning, and try not to think about the catastrophe before me. The air is sweet and soft, the sea a searing blue. I am watching the light play on the waves when, just beyond the port, I see the daily cargo boat approaching the shore, bringing supplies from the mainland: food and medicine and a nitrogen tank of donor sperm.In the days that follow, I like to think of my eggs in the laboratory, cells iding, happily gathering into blastocysts. It makes me feel less alone. I await news from the embryologist, sleeping, eating, taking long walks. One morning, I wake to a ruffling sound beyond my bedroom curtains. It is a bird, I think, that has flown into my courtyard. But when I look I find it is rain: heavy, plump drops on the corrugated iron roof and the broad leaves of the potted plants. That day the embryologist calls: transfer will be in two days’ time.Another flight is cancelled. Getting home will now take some 42 hours, several changes of plane, and hundreds of pounds. “Do I need to come and rescue you?” an ex-boyfriend emails. I tell him he should know by now that I am not someone who takes well to rescuing. Perhaps if I did, I would not be here doing IVF alone in a foreign country in the first place.I am worried about the pigeons. The square outside the cathedral, in normal times surrounded by busy restaurants, lies quiet deprived of their usual scraps, the birds seem bewildered. They flock near the cathedral steps, as if hoping for mercy. I take to feeding them: crusts of bread and old kalitsounia that brings them flocking around my ankles, burbling and fluttering as they eat. I feed the cats, too, their thin little bodies winding against my calves.I am the only patient at the clinic on the morning of my embryo transfer. The number of treatments is dwindling as no one can travel and there is too much uncertainty. My consultant, the junior nurse, the embryologist and I gather in the operating theatre. The embryologist plays Mozart through her phone to drown out the whirr of the generator. It is a simple procedure – the embryo being transferred to the womb via a catheter. “There!” the consultant says. On the screen I watch a small dot make its way across the darkness and then settle.For the next two weeks it will become the pale white dot upon which I live. I think about my tiny speck of hope as I follow the growing bleakness of the world: nurses in London wearing bin bags and scuba masks, the want of ventilators in New York City, the death toll in Italy that rises and rises. I try not to think about how I will get home, about the potential dangers of travelling across a continent, newly pregnant, in a pandemic.In my isolation chamber I feel like a Russian doll, inside me another smaller me, confined in her own small isolation. I have been pregnant enough times that this state feels familiar: all-engulfing, electric. And yet I have miscarried enough to know that nothing is certain. I have often thought that the two-week wait between conception and pregnancy test is like being alone in a strange house: every sound, every shadow, can convince you that someone is there.For a week I feel truly pregnant. And then suddenly I do not. One day I wake to feel a tangible distance between the synthetic hormones and my own body. I do not tell anyone. Instead I walk down to the water, stay out far beyond the mandated hour. I marvel at the flicker of tiny fish moving between the boats in the harbour. I look at the bright yellow tangle of fishing nets, the deep pink of wooden shutters, the distant mountains, snow-peaked against the bluest sky.I walk on beside the sea, past young couples, hands entwined, and think of how clinical and lustless the IVF process is. Of how a week ago I sat in a room that smelled of disinfectant, wearing a thin blue gown and a surgical mask. How there was no one’s hand to hold, no love in the room. In the streets outside, spring had begun. There was the smell of orange blossom, and violet carpenter bees danced between branches. I stared up at the voluminous petals of bright red flowers, at stamen and pollen and anther and stalk, and thought that this was how reproduction ought to be: stickiness and scent, warmth and desire, all the senses colliding at once.On the day I get a negative pregnancy test, 717 people die of coronavirus in the UK. For a long while, I sit on the edge of my bed and try to balance rationality and sorrow. I look at pictures from Italian hospitals, follow the upward curves of the latest graphs. Friends have lost loved ones, I tell myself I have lost someone who barely ever existed. And yet I walk out into the cool sun of my courtyard and cry.Some years ago, the writer India Knight published a self-help book, In Your Prime, in which she discussed the way that in adulthood our lives erge into two camps: the have-children and the have-nots. For those caught up in the business of parenthood, she wrote, “there is no especial pleasure to be had in a single andor childless person banging on about the minutiae of their small, unpeopled little life”. The phrase has stuck with me. As my friends have paired off and become parents, I have seen them less, travelled more, grown quieter. I cannot hope to understand the dramatic shifts and expansions in their lives, just as they are unlikely to understand the reduction of my own.And as the weeks of lockdown rolled on, that phrase has returned to me anew I came to think how all our lives have grown small and unpeopled. How we have come to find pleasure in the minutiae: the slow drift of days, the unfurling of blossom, a street filled with clapping on a warm spring evening. And sometimes, too, when all seems lost, a small patch of blue sky above a courtyard in Greece."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/329f1114b7dbaa4ebda3e353f6efee492c1ec8d2/0_316_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdc6e553456e70e18841ca13b2103d08","title":"rough sleepers must not be put back on streets after lockdown says top tory","story":"The ‘housing-first’ approach should be used to help homeless people now sheltering in hotels, urges chair of all-party MPs group Rough sleepers should be given permanent accommodation rather than being allowed to drift back on to the streets as the lockdown eases, according to the Conservative chair of the all-party parliamentary group for ending homelessness.The majority of England’s rough sleepers have been moved off the streets and into hotels to offer them protection during the pandemic.Bob Blackman said the government should now seize the opportunity to introduce the “housing-first” model, which sees rough sleepers given a permanent place to live as a priority before interventions in any other issues in their lives. This initiative is already used by a number of other countries such as Finland and Denmark.“It is my belief that the housing first model is the way to deal with what will be needed after coronavirus,” he said. “Here, people who are rough sleeping are taken off the street and given a property, and then assessed as to what their needs are. Support is then placed around them, and any medical needs are attended to so that they can recover and move on to a normal way of life”.He said that while the government had done a good job to get the homeless community into hotel accommodation during the pandemic “there is no plan from the top yet” to ensure that people stay housed.On Friday a leaked report suggested that government funding for the emergency scheme – Councils were given £3.2m in March – is to end. The government said it had given councils £3.2bn since March and urged them to keep supporting rough sleepers.Neil Coyle, the Labour co-chair of the group, said the pandemic had shown that “when political will is there, it is almost possible to alleviate all rough sleeping in a week”. But he also fears that this will not be a long-lasting success.Last Wednesday at prime minister’s questions, Boris Johnson was asked about plans to continue support following the pandemic. He was unable to confirm that any plans were in place.There is growing concern among those working with rough sleepers that their number could increase once the lockdown is lifted.Founder of The Big Issue, John Bird, said :“It is imperative that we plan now for what happens with the increased amount that will fall into poverty and homelessness because of the economic impact of coronavirus.”“We will have people who were OK before the pandemic but will now have their first taste of homelessness. The time has come for a radical new approach. We don’t need more stopgaps, we need the real thing: change”.Mike Matthews, who owns the Prince Rupert Hotel in Shrewsbury, is among the many hoteliers currently providing accommodation to rough sleepers. “It was a huge task to get these iniduals off the streets and into this hotel in the first place but now it is like living with a whole new, big family,” he said.“What we have seen has been remarkable. People are being rehabilitated, their physical and mental health is drastically improving.” But he fears for what may happen if his guests all have to leave very suddenly.Group member Daniel Zeichner, Labour MP for Cambridge, said that without a housing-first approach the future could be even bleaker for the homeless community. “There will be a terrible betrayal to those who have just opened themselves up to care.”Jinx has been self-dependent since he was a child, selling the Big Issue in several locations around the UK. Last month, he was contacted and asked to isolate in a Holiday Inn in Bristol.“I’ve been looking after and providing for myself since I was a teenager. I’ve never once begged or signed on. I’ve sold the Big Issue in London and Bristol for most of my life.”Jinx was initially worried about trusting others with his care. “I’ve always looked after myself, and this felt like me now not being in control. But like a lot of other homeless people, I was scared and am still scared about this virus, so I knew that I had to hole up in a hotel.”He said he is “clueless” about what will happen to him after isolation. “I’ve not heard anything from the council or from where I’m staying. Me and the people that I’m with have been asked to change our lives completely, and it feels like we’ll now be kicked out again at the end of it. It’s a massive worry. It’s the not knowing that’s scary.”“We will continue to prioritise and support this effort and have provided £3.2bn to councils to deal with immediate pressures, including supporting rough sleepers.“Our new rough sleeping taskforce – spearheaded by Dame Louise Casey – will work hand in hand with councils across the country on plans to ensure as many rough sleepers as possible can move into long-term, safe accommodation once the immediate crisis is over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3325a71cd8441be29381b75fd10d80352bc0522c/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5339e07a57004bdd4a004ffc48b57a56","title":"government to invest 93m in uk vaccine manufacturing centre","story":"Facility to open next summer, with earlier deployment possible to make coronavirus vaccineThe British government will invest up to £93m to bring forward construction of a new vaccine manufacturing centre, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said on Saturday.The funding will ensure the new centre opens in summer 2021, a year ahead of schedule. The Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC) is a key component of the government’s programme to ensure that once a coronavirus vaccine is available, it can be rolled out quickly in mass quantities, the department said.The not-for-profit facility on the Harwell science and innovation campus in Oxfordshire will have the capacity to produce enough doses for the entire UK population in as little as six months.A further £38m is being invested in a rapid deployment facility which will be able to begin manufacturing at scale from this summer if a vaccine becomes available before the new centre is complete.Officials said the VMIC would also boost the UK’s long-term capacity for dealing with future viruses and accelerate the production of vaccines for existing illnesses such as the flu virus.Announcing the investment, Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said: “Once a breakthrough is made, we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions.”Sir Mark Walport, the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) chief executive, called the centre “an essential new weapon in the UK’s arsenal against diseases and other biological threats”.He said: “The UKRI-funded teams at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London have developed potential coronavirus vaccines at unprecedented speed.“By working with partners including government, VMIC and the Vaccines Taskforce to fast-track the manufacturing capability, we are ensuring that momentum will continue all the way from lab to patient.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d688630bb47192f9fa83737da456f4b783935e9/0_214_5150_3091/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3e07f9642523042f5c62e4439a91629","title":"england to use contact cluster plan to put on summer test series","story":"England’s plan to stage international cricket this summer involves hiving off players from contact with other personnel at the ground and forming exclusive “contact clusters” to reduce the risk of Covid-19 sweeping through the camp.Under detailed plans seen by the Observer, the proposed series against West Indies and Pakistan in July and August will be staged behind closed doors at “bio-secure” venues that are split into zones, with movement between these kept to a minimum.Players and support staff will make up what is known as a “functional area” – one of a number of such groups working on site – and have the option to create smaller social pods within this called “contact clusters” that allow iniduals to further relax in the company of others who have committed to it.It means, as well as regular testing for coronavirus and daily screening for symptoms, the enlarged 30-man squads will need to stay mindful of how they move around and interact with others during an extended spell living at either the Ageas Bowl or Old Trafford, the two Test grounds with hotels on site.Such extreme lengths to put on matches highlights the desperate need to get cricket on screens this summer and prevent the England and Wales Cricket Board suffering a devastating financial loss. But there is growing optimism the two sets of Test tourists are willing to make the journey and put their players in such extreme lockdown conditions.Further talks with Cricket West Indies are due to take place on Monday, while an initial conference call with the Pakistan board on Friday, which included the head coaches Misbah-ul-Haq and Chris Silverwood, has reportedly resulted in Pakistan committing to three Tests and three Twenty20 matches.Drafted by the ECB’s science and medicine team, an introductory outline was circulated to the counties last week explaining the process for the return of professional cricket that, from Wednesday, will see the first of 30 England players behin inidual training under phase one. But it also lays out the principles of how a bio-secure venue may operate on match day.The cricket grounds used this summer – expected to be the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford because of their on-site hotels – will be ided up into areas and movement between them strictly limited. A one-way system of paths will be set up around the ground.This is a group of staff – for example players or broadcasters – who are clearly defined and must operate solely within their designated zones. Some zones may be required to have more than one functional area working in it at the same time, such as players and ground staff on the outfield before the start of a match, but they cannot interact.Contact clustersIniduals within a functional area can form their own exclusive social pod that, provided everyone involved commits to remaining socially distant from outsiders, allows them to relax in each other’s company.All three concepts are designed to minimise the number of interactions an inidual makes and reduces the risk of transmission in the event of an outbreak.After phase two, where training is permitted to take place in small groups, players and support staff from both sides would enter an “island site” – a cricket ground with a hotel – for phase three and, following initial testing for coronavirus, they will then live and train on site but only within strictly designated zones. Ashley Giles, England’s cricket director, has confirmed they are looking at ways England’s players can leave and re-enter the so-called “bubble” given a block of nine weeks away from friends and family that covers preparation time, practice games and the six proposed Tests, starting at Hampshire’s Ageas Bowl on 8 July.However when the squad is together in the ground and part of a regular testing and screening programme it forms a “functional area”, one of a number of separate personnel groups that also include venue staff, the ECB events team, groundstaff, broadcastersmedia and match officials within an overall headcount of around 300.These FAs must each stick to their designated zones within the hotel and stadium and though two such groups may find themselves down to operate in the same zone at times – for example players and ground staff on the outfield before the start of a match – contact between them must be kept to an absolute minimum.The system is designed to create clearly defined distance between FAs and, in theory, prevent the spread of Covid-19 should it penetrate the ground. Perhaps the most intriguing element of the plan is the concept of “contact clusters”, where iniduals within an FA group can create their own exclusive sub-group.The principle here is that iniduals within a “contact cluster” avoid anything but essential contact with those outside of it and so can be more comfortable within what is called “a circle of trust”. How this applies to the social dynamics of two playing squads that will both be up to 30 cricketers-strong remains to be seen.Schematics for the grounds detail the various zones and there will be signposted one-way systems to navigate on foot. Personnel will also be urged to sanitise hands at entry points to communal areas and use alternative methods of communication, such as telephone calls or video conferencing, where possible.While the introductory document states an intention to create isolation areas for iniduals who become ill, as well as exit strategies and contact tracing, a full medical protocol for how a possible outbreak may be tackled has not yet been shared and will be crucial to receiving sign-off from the government.England’s players have had a number of the details above explained to them already – one told the Observer it was “mind-blowing” – but much will hinge on convincing West Indies, the first set of tourists, they will be safe to leave the relatively untouched Caribbean to fly to one of the pandemic’s hotspots.Giles has already admitted the plans have a number of “pinch points” that need fully ironing out before they can be put back to the government, while the International Cricket Council is yet to rule on whether players who have passed testing can still apply saliva to the ball and, if not, permit some form of legalised ball tampering.The bill for creating these bio-secure venues and flying two touring teams into the country on charter flights will run well into seven figures and the proposed tours will ultimately hinge on how the national picture looks in the coming weeks as lockdown measures in the UK begin to be relaxed.With the ECB facing losses of £380m in the event of no cricket being staged this summer – and six Tests worth an estimated £120m in broadcast revenues – the governing body is throwing every possible resource at getting international cricket back on television."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a0f21716fbf6a5276c23e9ab7ebc7690aec51e3/0_2809_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82de123fc89ef02f32301350dc21eb3f","title":"my dads piece of wales in canadia lakeside cottage","story":"The writer tells of tracing her father’s connection with a fellow Welshman who emigrated almost a century ago – and put down roots in OntarioA decade ago, my father, Terry Lee, found a wooden sign behind our cottage’s boathouse. He guessed it had once hung above the door, naming this Ontario lakeside property: Brynmorwydd. Dad, who grew up in Cardiff and emigrated to Canada in the 1970s, knew right away it was Welsh. But the cottage, which originally belonged to my stepmother’s family, was actually an exercise in Canadianness for my dad, who isn’t exactly handy with canoes or campfires. I don’t suppose he ever anticipated that it would draw him back to Wales, but some weeks later he spotted the name of the cottage’s first owner stamped on one of its beams: John G Bolt.He searched deeds, records, maps and censuses with the help of my uncle, and the story emerged of John Bolt, born in 1886 near Llanrhaeadr, north Wales. The son of a gamekeeper, he moved away to Cheshire at the age of eight, after his parents died. In 1927, Bolt sailed to Canada and worked on the Canadian Pacific Railway: he claimed a plot of land, built a cottage, and named it after the estate where he’d been born: Brynmorwydd.Dad and I arrived in Llanrhaeadr-yng-Nghinmeirch in summer 2013. Fog spread over the valleys, obscuring the sheep. It had been a decade since we’d holidayed together. While dad was renovating the cottage, I’d been living in England. But this trip was designed to bring us together: he wanted to track down the original Brynmorwydd I was doing a PhD in landscape history. We felt like an ideal team.Each day, we ventured out in search of clues: the estate no longer existed, and while some placenames remained, few buildings did. We had an 1875 OS map, which I compared with Google Maps, searching for the spot where Bolt was born.We stopped in the pub and chatted to the barman. “A bit of an odd request,” dad began, his Welsh lilt swimming into the corners of his now-Canadian accent. “We’ve come from Canada, where we own a cottage by the name of Brynmorwydd …” “You’ll want to talk to the gentleman in the corner,” said the barman, pointing to an elderly man eating Sunday dinner. “He grew up in the estate’s main house.”It seemed too coincidental. The man told us the land was up a narrow lane. And private. Undeterred, we drove up the winding lane to the crest of a hill. There was hardly anything there. An abandoned building, a gate, a No Trespassing sign and a wide valley view: a green quilt with hedgerow seams. Was this what John Bolt longed for? Dad pulled out a photograph of the wooden sign and posed for a picture.We open our cottage each year when the ice on our bay has melted. Among the teapots and old photographs, a folder entitled “John G Bolt” holds the papers we carried as we combed the countryside. On every visit, I open it to check the pages are in order, then look for my father. He may be fumbling to split logs or tidying the boathouse. Once in a while he’ll rest, looking over the water that stretches before our Brynmorwydd.Jessica J Lee is an author and environmental historian.

And for everyone else, too. Wind of Change, an eight-part series released in one go on Spotify and week by week everywhere else, is a fascinating listen from Brooklyn’s Pineapple Street Studios, with one of the snappiest elevator pitches ever. Was the 1990 lighters-aloft anthem Wind of Change by Scorpions actually written by the CIA?Well: was it? You’re going to have to listen to find out, but anyone who has read Jon Ronson’s The Men Who Stare at Goats or watched Ben Affleck in Argo will know that such loopy US soft power efforts are not beyond the realms of possibility. Investigative journalist Patrick Radden Keefe is the man who takes us on the long (sometimes too long) journey towards the truth, and he works hard to do so, travelling to Kiev (pronounced Keev, who knew?), Lagos and the Cayman Islands in his efforts to track down the true writer of such classic couplets as “The future’s in the air  I can feel it everywhere”. Like a drop of ink in water, the story blossoms and spreads, stains what seemed previously clear.This tale involves close-mouthed people, but what we do learn is interesting: about the jobs that people go to when they leave the CIA (many become wealth advisers, apparently) about how spies tend to be charming and gregarious, while never telling you anything. We learn that other recruits have a career in Hollywood and are approached by the CIA for help with, say, facial disguises. We meet band managers, concert organisers, fans and drug runners, as well as Klaus Meine, Scorpions’ frontman (in the last episode).If you find yourself waiting for the story to take off, be warned: it doesn’t, really. Instead, Keefe’s questions begin to spiral into themselves, burrow down, flare out. It takes him some time to realise a music journalism truism: a hit song is written by the times in which it exists as much as by its actual songwriter. Still, Wind of Change is a beautifully constructed listen, never less than entertaining. I burned through it in a day and loved every minute.Another conspiracy theory podcast launches this week, but this one, Scarlett Moffatt Wants to Believe, is less meticulous, more sofa-based. Ex-Goggleboxer Moffatt, as she explains in the first episode, has always been obsessed by conspiracy theories, as has her dad. Not just conspiracy theories either her dad used to take her out looking for crop circles and hid essential supplies in the attic for him and her, in order to be ready for a zombie apocalypse. (Her mum said she didn’t want to hold them back from their escape, what with her asthma, and would rather just be turned into a zombie and get it over with.)Scarlett presents with her boyfriend Scott Dobinson, who provides the cynical counterpoint to her excited waffle. This is a BBC podcast, so there needs to be balance, and Scott is it. What this means is that Moffatt brings up, say, the Roswell incident, and Dobinson points out, quite reasonably, that it was a long time ago, that the witnesses were unreliable, that the US government has said the “UFO” was a surveillance balloon. “Stoooop!” wails Moffatt, as Dobinson also says that the one real witness was well known to embellish his stories, having falsely claimed to be a pilot with five air medals for shooting down planes. “We’ve all exaggerated stories, doesn’t mean he’s a liar!” says Moffatt. She’ll never be a lawyer.The main problem with the podcast’s premise is that Moffatt’s “evidence” is pretty pathetic: nothing more than a quick Wiki would cough up (actually, less than that). But of course that’s not really the point. SMWTB is aimed at the Sh**ged, Married, Annoyed market, with our happy couple’s silly bickering providing the podcast’s true appeal, rather than any definitive proof of, for example, whether the moon landings actually happened (clue: they did). And in that the podcast succeeds: Moffatt and Dobinson are delightful people, and spending an easy 40 minutes with them is a nice thing to do. I just wouldn’t send either of them on any “did MI5 write Coldplay’s Fix You?” missions just yet.Swipe Left Swipe LeftSwiping left or right is not a realistic option en ce moment, unless you can convince yourself that a successful hook-up involves socially distanced tennis or an afternoon’s deer-stalking. Still, SLSL, now in its second series, is a nice way to remind yourself of the ups and downs of dating. Mostly, the downs. The new series opens with a disastrous and thoroughly cringe-making story based around a cheese shop. Exemplary use of music (by which I mean, it makes me laugh), plus a genuinely hot episode (episode four) – Swipe Left’s love stories are very sweet short listens.The National Archives: LoveBritain’s National Archives has had a podcast since 2006, but has recently started using its vast resources to make a few three-part miniseries called On the Record, about spies, protest and, now, love. Each episode uses letters to illustrate an aspect of love: disappointed or forbidden love, and love ided, so far. Whether these letters are between gay lovers when homosexuality was illegal, or between Queen Elizabeth I and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, they are revealing in the hands of presenters and National Archive employees Matt Norman and Katie Fox. Norman and Fox’s hosting can be a little stodgy, but their analysis is great.You’ll DoCatherine Bohart and Sarah Keyworth are comedians separately and in a relationship together, and this newish podcast has them talking to other couples about different aspects of being and staying together. Is there such a thing as a perfect date night? (No.) Fast-talking and quick-witted, there is very little that Bohart and Keyworth won’t talk about. They manage to keep things moving with their guests, while getting into the nitty-gritty and unpicking roles and triggers within relationships. Plus, their selection of couples (not always heteronormative) makes this a more interesting podcast than most of this kind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfef76e42da6298d528fb31c11e6361facff69f7/0_1_4981_2989/master/4981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b7f41c0deffe24243d2ee99dc2404ad","title":"are you planning to return to your workplace on wednesday","story":"If you’re preparing to go back to work – away from home – we’d like to hear from you.

An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.It raises questions about the extent to which restrictions can be safely eased in coming weeks. In his address on Sunday, Boris Johnson said: “We have the R below 1, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below 1.”The slight increase and narrowing in range is not linked to lockdown relaxations this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago.A likely explanation is that while overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R. Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes.The figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing.It comes as data showed that while London was a hotspot of infection at the start of the epidemic, attention is now shifting to the north of England, where transmission rates of Covid-19 appear to be falling far less steeply.Some epidemiological models suggest transmission rates in the capital are now half those seen in the north-east and Yorkshire, raising the question of whether all areas will be safe to emerge from lockdown at the same time.There is growing unease among civic leaders in the north of England at plans to ease lockdown rules, with one council leader branding it as “frankly, madness”.The leader of Gateshead council, Martin Gannon, said on Friday that the advice to the public to “stay at home” would continue. Gannon, whose views on lockdown were echoed by his counterparts in Newcastle and Sunderland, said there was evidence that the R rate was greater than 1 in his borough.How do models calculate the R value?The R value tells you how many infections each infected person passes the virus on to, on average. For an R above 1, the epidemic increases exponentially below 1 it will eventually fizzle out. In the absence of direct measures of this elusive number, modellers have to rely on what firm data we have and extrapolate from there.Some models, such as one by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University, rely on the numbers of reported deaths, and the steep, steady decline in deaths in London translates into an estimate that community transmission must have also rapidly dropped off.Deaths are reliable figures, less subject to biases than some other measures, but they reflect the infection rates that were occurring about three weeks previously and so do not give a dynamic reflection of where things are.Policy changes around working and socialising introduced in the past week may have influenced R, but a model based on deaths will not give any insights into this. The PHE model projected that there might be as few as 24 new cases in the capital per day on 10 May. This reflects the strong downward trend London has been on, but the model is not designed to give razor-sharp predictions of day-by-day infection statistics. On Thursday, 49 people with new infections were admitted to hospitals in London.Some models rely on measures such as symptoms reported to phone apps, which have a shorter lag time. However, these data are more “noisy” and so give a less robust measure of R overall, although they can give better insight into short-range changes.The data from hospital admissions and deaths also suggest that R has come down far more steeply in London than in other regions. The PHE and Cambridge model suggests that R in London is 0.4, compared with 0.8 in the north-east and Yorkshire and 0.75 for the country as a whole.This is one of a handful of models feeding into advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to government, and all are showing broadly similar patterns across the regions. However, the extent of the differences varies, meaning that an optimistic estimate for London cannot be relied on too heavily.Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, described the PHECambridge estimate for London as “extremely low”. His own team’s predictions put the London R value closer to 0.6.“This still predicts a faster decline in London than the rest of the country, but not as dramatic … The difference between 0.4 and 0.6 might sound like scientists arguing over small details, but these translate to very substantial differences in the rate of decline of cases, or the time for the epidemic to halve,” he said.Initially, London was a few weeks ahead of other regions of the country because far more infections were seeded there at the start of the epidemic. However, it has also seen a steeper decline and, in fact, may have always had a slightly lower community transmission rate than some other geographical regions.There are likely to be a wide range of factors behind this. London may now have a higher level of population immunity, which could be playing a role in bringing down transmission, since a higher proportion of people have been infected.“If it turns out that there’s loads of immunity in the community, then that’s brilliant, but I don’t think we should plan for that scenario,” said Thomas House, reader in mathematical statistics at the University of Manchester. “We don’t really know yet.”There are also likely to be substantially different contributions from hospitals and care homes, where transmission rates have not been effectively brought under control. In some regions, the spread of infection in these settings, where lockdown does not have the same impact, could be making a major contribution to keeping R close to 1.Differences in living arrangements – for instance, larger family groups living together outside London – could play a role. Models may also not fully capture the role of underlying health issues and deprivation in raising the risk of severe cases.There isn’t strong evidence for this. The lockdown has brought down transmission rates in the community across the country, and a forthcoming study from scientists at Imperial College London does not seem to suggest that London has been an outlier in terms of compliance.“The uniformity with which the UK responded to the lockdown is remarkable,” said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics. “I thought maybe people in London who were close to a large epidemic would be much more compliant than elsewhere. But the behaviour change was very well synchronised across the UK.”This is an emerging view among scientists. “Based on just the epidemiology, it makes a tremendous amount of sense,” said House. “There’s no point locking down if there’s no cases to prevent.” However, he and others acknowledge that the political decision will be weighted by factors beyond simply modelling the trajectory of case numbers.“It’s much more difficult to message the relaxation than it is to message the lockdown,” said Riley. “I suspect the most difficult aspect on possible regional differences is how you would message it. That uncertainty would be much greater than any mechanistic modelling uncertainty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/142fe220fe51ac4b370e6d7880fac7612cc8f89f/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d00e08e14bcf9b91c01cc552b9fdead","title":"gps press ministers for clear testing strategy to avoid second wave of coronavirus","story":"Head of Royal College of GPs writes to health secretary about lack of confidence in current effortsThe government needs a clear strategy on testing to prevent a second wave of coronavirus infections, doctors have said.The Royal College of GPs said it was not confident in the government’s current testing strategy and accusing ministers of an “arbitrary focus on numbers” and targets.In a letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the RCGP chair, Prof Martin Marshall, also raised concerns about the accuracy and timing of test results.He acknowledged that improvements have been made, but said a clear and comprehensive plan was needed to stop a second wave of cases.Marshall wrote: “We do not believe that there is sufficient clarity on a joined-up comprehensive testing strategy to prevent a second wave of infections and to secure the overall health of the population.“As we ease lockdown over the coming weeks and months, it is essential that the profession and patients have full confidence in the approach to test, track and trace.”Marshall said a joint approach was required between the NHS, social care and community care, including care homes, which he said were on the frontline of the pandemic.“In the absence of a clear strategy and with delays in social care planning, patients have been left vulnerable,” he said. “I am sure you will agree that now is the time to move beyond an arbitrary focus on numbers and targets and ensure that our loved ones in vulnerable settings are given particular protection.”Marshall stressed the importance of confidence in the testing strategy from both the healthcare profession and the general public as the government moves to ease parts of the lockdown.He said the government needed to inform the public clearly about the importance of test, track and trace and other measures that will accompany the NHS Covid-19 tracking app, and provide GPs with clear guidance on how to get patients tested.The RCGP was also aware of concerns from healthcare workers about the accuracy and timing of some test results, he said. “We know that the distances that tests are travelling to labs and the wait time for results is undermining confidence in the process and results themselves.“Any testing strategy must therefore commit to building confidence in the process, including a commitment to improving the sensitivity and specificity of the tests.”Sir Mark Walport, the chief executive of UK Research and Innovation and a former government chief scientific adviser, said test, track and trace was vital, because a second wave was considered a very real possibility.He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “It is a combination of people being really careful about how they behave coupled with identifying cases as early and as rigorously by testing as possible, and then working out who their contacts have been and making sure that they do isolate themselves.“As measures are taken to relax social distancing, they have got to be taken very, very cautiously indeed. There is no question that the prospect of a second wave does exist. That is undoubtedly the case. It will continue to exist while there are a significant number of cases out there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48774a821c7889b9418b1d4dced8bb1d9b109f6c/174_0_1642_985/master/1642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=498706d63ad8c41137b58c970169db32","title":"jacinda ardern rejected from cafe at coronavirus capacity","story":"New Zealand prime minister unable to be accommodated under distancing rulesIt’s rare for a country’s leader to just casually drop into a cafe for a snack. Rarer still for them to be turned away.But that is exactly what happened on Saturday when the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was turned away from a popular cafe in Wellington which was full due to coronavirus distancing measures.“Omg Jacinda Ardern just tried to come into Olive and was rejected cause it’s full,” a Twitter user named Joey wrote at about midday.His tweet was accompanied by a ghoulish emoji, suggesting he was horrified that space was not made for the Labour leader, despite restaurants being limited to a maximum of 100 people and at least 1 metre between seated groups. A quarter of an hour later, he added: “Never mind they sorted her out.”Arden’s partner, Clarke Gayford, responded to his tweet a few hours later, taking the blame for the brief hiccup to their day.“I have to take responsibility for this, I didn’t get organised and book anywhere,” he wrote. “Was very nice of them to chase us down st when a spot freed up. A+ service.”While leaders in other countries may send staff ahead to make arrangements, a spokesperson for Ardern’s office said waiting at a cafe was something anyone could experience during New Zealand’s virus restrictions: “The PM says she just waits like everyone else.”Without providing his name, the restaurant’s owner told the New Zealand Herald that he was pleased to be talking about “something light-hearted and fun” following “the drama and stress” of the previous two months.He confirmed no exceptions were made for Ardern and that she and Gayford were initially turned away by the restaurant manager. However, the manager then ran down the street minutes later, after a table became free, which he stressed is a courtesy extended to other customers.Fewer than 1,500 people have been infected with Covid-19 in New Zealand, and 21 people have died, after the government pursued a vigorous elimination strategy, shutting its borders on 15 March and entering a country-wide lockdown 10 days later.As the country edges back to normal, the incident shows that while New Zealand’s prime minister has reached near record-breaking approval levels, the country is remaining vigilant. “We’re following every one of the rules,” Olive’s owner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/459fff03319873651d6f41b7336c50d9cac8186f/71_99_3162_1897/master/3162.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1de97bcf685c6802e7b7489fdcaf6349","title":"sports starved british fans tune into german football as it restarts","story":"It wasn’t the Premier League and the stands were empty.

The combination of recorded cheers and tinny music that accompanied each of Dortmund’s four goals made their absence starker.“It’s like going to a nightclub without music or a pub without beer,” said Dr Mark Doidge, a senior research fellow in sport at the University of Brighton. “Sport is nothing without emotion.”Doidge is a huge fan and has followed the Bundesliga for several years, enticed, as he says, by the “full stadiums of active fans, creating a spectacle”.“I’m finding myself torn,” he admitted. “I really want to watch some football and I like watching the Bundesliga. But do I want to buy into a system where the fans themselves in Germany are saying we don’t want the games to be taking place without us there.“The television companies scrabbling to get football back because they paid for it might be need to be careful what they wish for because the spectacle won’t be very good.”Since lockdown began, sports fans have found various ways to fill their time. Surreal sporting commentary has become a niche genre. Andrew Cotter, the golf commentator, has gone viral with wryly amusing play-by-plays of the exploits of his two labradors, Olive and Mabel.Nick Heath usually commentates on rugby matches but has been watching squirrels, dogs and birds in his south London park and posting the results on Instagram and Tik Tok as part of his #LifeCommentary. He has gone from 15,000 followers to 130,000 – most of them women.“I’ve had a lot of messages from women saying ‘I don’t really do sports – that’s my husband’s domain. But if this is what it looks, like then count me in’,” he said. In the end though, says Heath, live professional sport needs spectators in the stands. “Riding the crowd noise is important,” he says. “Commentators will have to find that joy, that euphoria that come with those big moments in sport.”Watching the Bundesliga, it’s clear that if and when it gets under way, lockdown Premier League will never be able to provide moments such as the reaction to Sergio Aguero’s goal to win the league for Manchester City in the last seconds of the final game in 2012."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11046efa7f9314c69d46597e477dca7b2bcad25d/0_4_5783_3470/master/5783.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b10c86be7a6b85afdc6b4ff9bc9c5294","title":"us states begin reopening contact tracing programs scramble","story":"Patchwork of efforts as states left to devise own programs and local health department are still hiring people to test and trace contactsAs state after state begins to reopen in the United States, local health departments charged with tracking down everyone who has been in close contact with those who test positive for coronavirus are still scrambling to hire the number of people they need to do the job.They are often hundreds – even thousands – of people short of targets for their so-called contact tracing programs. Public health experts have consistently said robust programs to test more people and trace their contacts are needed for states to safely reboot their economies and prevent a resurgence of the virus.Cook county, Illinois, has just 29 contact tracers serving 2.5 million people living in suburban communities around Chicago. The jail in Cook county has been an intense hotspot for Covid-19.Los Angeles county, at more than 10 million people has a population slightly greater than Michigan, and has just 400 of the estimated 6,000 contact tracers it will need under California’s criteria for a broader reopening.With 2.7 million residents and roughly 100 to 300 new Covid-19 cases a day, Miami-Dade county in Florida, home to Miami and Miami Beach, has 175 people tracking down people who were potentially exposed to the virus.“The whole point of the lockdown was to buy time to have a better way to keep numbers down,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the humanitarian response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa during the Obama administration.“And that’s why so many of us are screaming ourselves hoarse about testing and tracing.”Public health experts say contact tracing systems should be in place before cases become widespread, so every new infection can be tracked and the person’s contacts identified, tested and isolated from the rest of the community.Until recently, there had been scant federal guidance on what contact tracing should look like, and there is still no coordinated federal strategy.While other countries are taking a national approach to contact tracing, the US is leaving it to states to devise their own programs.The result has been a patchwork of efforts. An Associated Press review in late April found little consensus among states on basic questions such as how many investigators are needed.  Contact tracing was one of the “core state preparedness responsibilities” outlined in the White House guidelines for reopening the country, but governors have been pressing ahead with lifting restrictions without having comprehensive programs in place.Hall county, which has over 200,000 residents and the second-highest rate of coronavirus cases in Georgia, has between 30 and 40 contact tracers assigned to the local public health district, which also serves a dozen neighboring counties. It hopes to receive an additional 30 from the state.Georgia was among the first states to ease restrictions. Public health experts have expressed concern that the state was risking a spike in cases by moving too quickly. So far, the state has hired 250 contact tracers with a goal of reaching 1,000.While there is no federal formula for how many of the disease detectives are needed, public health experts have said one contact tracer is needed for every 1,000 to 3,000 residents in the US, or between 100,000 and 300,000 nationally. For Georgia, that would be between 3,333 and 10,000.During congressional testimony this past week, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, reiterated his concern that parts of the US might be easing restrictions too early without having the ability to respond effectively to an increase in cases with “good identification, isolation and contact tracing”.The next day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released general guidance to states on contact tracing. It said the number of cases investigators and contact tracers needed in each community “may be large” and will vary, in part due to caseloads.  Under California’s criteria for a broader reopening, counties should have 15 people trained in contact tracing for every 100,000 residents. The state is helping, working to train between 10,000 and 20,000 tracers, but most large counties are falling short.  Harris county, Texas’s most populous with more than 4.7 million residents, is working to train about 300 contact tracers by 22 May. It has been two weeks since Texas reopened retail, restaurants, malls and movie theaters to limited numbers of customers.  In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Department of Public Health has trained a small number of contact tracers and wants to hire more to be deployed once the number of new infections has dropped enough to make contact tracing practical, spokesman James Garrow said.A few states, including Utah, made contact tracing a priority before beginning to ease restrictions.

Beaches will officially open on Wednesday.The Spanish government will seek to extend its coronavirus state of emergency for the last time until late June, as the country’s daily death toll reached a near eight-week low.The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said on Saturday that the state’s new confirmed Covid-19 cases are predominantly coming from people who left their homes to go shop, exercise or socialise, and not from essential workers.

Illustration: Michael Viney Early to my desk, I found the hillside seriously somnolent: the ewes still pillowed, their lambs close and dozing. The ocean gleamed with zig-zags of calm and the strand was as bare as the whole bank holiday Monday.But then, at the far ditch, a bird rose sharply into the air. Dark and floppy-winged, it flung itself aloft, climbing and circling house-high above the pasture, abruptly tumbling and plunging, then rising again – and again.Even without its distant, creaky cries, the flashes of white beneath the wings declared a cock lapwing in territorial display, new and exciting to me as I watched across the hedge. Wheatears and pipits in that rough meadow, yes, but breeding lapwings were new. Soon, however, in an odd lurch of hops from one fencepost to the next, the bird vanished and did not reappear. His solitary display, bereft of any female lapwing, had left him to wander on.Ireland’s lapwing, like the curlew and other ground-nesting waders, seem doomed to a dismal decline. Their breeding range in Ireland has halved and at the Shannon callows, once a stronghold, numbers are down by more than 80 per cent.BirdWatch Ireland, with Government support, is seeking help from citizen scientists in a national survey of breeding pairs: follow Project Lapwing on Twitter or at Bioersity Ireland.Meanwhile, my lonely lapwing set me thinking of all the birds in springtime that never find a mate. “Floaters” as ornithologists call them, have a largely unknown life. But now, from eagles to sparrows, their role in conserving bird populations is under growing study.‘Limit to multiplication’Floaters themselves are scarcely new – Darwin was aware of non-breeding birds. And one of Ireland’s finest field naturalists, Charles Moffat, was the first to hint at their significance. In a paper in the Irish Naturalist in 1903, on the spring rivalry of birds, Moffat offered “some views on the limit to multiplication”. They challenged the widespread idea that, for bird population to remain stable, up to 90 per cent of new young birds must die.Spring rivalry for territory, he argued, “results in such a parcelling out of land as must limit the number of breeding pairs to a fairly constant figure and prevent indefinite increase. . . at the same time condemning the less powerful iniduals to unproductiveness rather than death.”In what’s sometimes known as “Moffat’s Equilibrium”, non-breeders are available to fill nesting vacancies, a buffer that can protect populations from decline or extinction.Some floaters may hang around on the fringe of breeding territories, living secretive, unstudied lives or perhaps sneaking the odd “extra-pair copulation” as they wait for a vacant territory.In birds such as crows, swans and waders, non-breeders occur separately in flocks, sometimes of nearly half the population. Some may also act as “helpers” to active families. In Greenland, with ornithologist David Cabot, I watched as pairs of barnacle geese, marshalling their chicks against marauding Arctic foxes, were joined by non-breeding geese in a fierce, deterrent beating of wings.With May so much the month of the cuckoo, I inquired of Google Scholar as to the occurrence of male floaters: how many of them go on carolling in vain? But any such research eluded me. Spare females, I learned, do exist and may be hunted out of the territories of breeding cuckoo pairs.Notorious lifestyleTo describe them as pairs seems ill-fitting, given the notorious lifestyle in which the female lays her eggs in the nests of unwitting songbirds (in Ireland, mainly the meadow pipit).Indeed, the female is rarely seen, keeping well under cover between her swift and parasitic sorties, but also hunting the hairy caterpillars that most other birds reject. Her sex life can be arduous, given the frequent, pressing attention of the male, which can sometimes yield up to 25 eggs in a season. Females have been seen with two or more pursuers.Such sexual harassment has even been linked to the colour of their plumage. Most cuckoos of both sexes resemble some sort of hawk, with greyish back, barred underparts, long tail and direct, dashing flight. But some females are quite rufously brown, like their young.Experiments with decoy females have found that males “attempted to copulate more frequently and excessively with the grey morph”, suggesting evolution of the brownies as a female-only force for selection.As I write, early in May, no cuckoo has arrived on this side of the hill. The Burren and Connemara usually have the greatest density of pairs, but the species is rapidly declining in both islands.In the UK, the British Trust for Ornithology tracks the migration of five satellite-tagged cuckoos on their spring return from the forests of the Congo. It has a webpage that maps their routes, and on last inspection four of the birds had arrived in England in April.In Ireland, records in the whole island are collected by Dr Damien McFerran at the Ulster Museum (habitas.org.ukrecordssubmit-cuckoo-record).

Photograph: Brian LawlessPAThe Government has given the go-ahead for the first stage of lifting Covid-19 restrictions from Monday, May 18th. Under this initial phase of reopening the country, construction and other outdoor work will be permitted, some retail outlets such as hardware – but not homeware – shops will be allowed to open and groups of four people will be allowed to meet outdoors, once they observe social distancing.On Saturday the director of the national virus reference laboratory Dr Cillian de Gascun gave additional information about how the easing would operate. He also said people should still try and avoid visiting friends and family under phase one. So what is allowed from Monday? Can I pop over to my friend’s garden for a drink?According to official guidelines, yes, you can as long as no more than four people gather together. However, Dr de Gascun warned that meeting up in a back garden could result in visitors using bathroom or kitchen facilities which could lead to a further spread of the virus. “It’s just adding additional risk,” he told RTÉ’s Saturday with Cormac Ó hEadra programme. “If you’re handing me a beer that’s fine, it can go straight into the bin or you can leave it on the wall… but if you’re giving me utensils or delph from your house, I’m seeding the virus onto it.”How long can I hang out with friends and do we have to meet outdoors? The advice is not to spend longer than 15 minutes in close contact with people and to always leave two metres distance between once another. However, Dr de Gascun acknowledged that people would probably spend longer together so just to be careful to stay away from one another. Any meetings should take place outdoors unless you have a very large roomhall which enables social distancing. Can I visit one friend in the morning and another in the evening?Dr de Gascun advised people not to meet more than one social group in a day and to restrict interactions to a small number of friends and family for at least the next three weeks. When will we know whether lifting the restrictions has impacted on the spread of the virus?It will take between 5-7 days before the impact becomes clear, said Dr De Gascun. “It’s going to be week two by the time we see what effect lifting restrictions has had. That’s why we wanted a three week period so we can analyse the first two weeks.”“The only way we can prevent people dying is by quenching virus activity in the community. So the community really is where everything starts and that’s where we want people to stay at home and minimise their interactions because any increase in cases in the community will have a knock on effect to hospitalization.”Dr de Gascun said it was “likely” there would be an increase in cases following the lifting of restrictions due to people’s increased movement and social interactions. Why is the wearing of masks on public transport and in supermarkets only being advised and not compulsory?Dr de Gascun said the Government was reluctant to make mask wearing mandatory as certain people may have problems wearing face coverings because of breathing difficulties or allergies. Others may need to see people’s mouths for lip reading, he added. Dr Holohan warned on Friday that “we cannot regard face coverings as some sort of magic shield . . . It’s a supplement to the other measures we are recommending.”“This is an additional hygiene measure, it’s not a magic bullet for this disease, and that has to be understood.”However, the National Transport Authority has urged people to wear masks when using public transport. What ever happened to the contact tracing app the Government was talking about a few weeks ago?When asked about this on Saturday, Dr de Gascun initially said he understood that plans for the app had “drifted” before correcting himself and saying he wasn’t involved in its development but he believed it would be ready but the end of May.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe People should continue to avoid visiting friends’ homes and only socialise in outdoor, public locations, the director of the national virus reference laboratory Dr Cillian de Gascun said on Saturday. From Monday, the State will begin the first stage of lifting the Covid-19 restrictions which have brought commercial and social life to a halt since March.Under this first phase of re-opening the country, groups of four people may meet outdoors once they observe social distancing, according to Government guidelines. However, Dr de Gascun urged people not to become complacent about social distancing when meeting friends and warned that gathering in people’s gardens could lead to visitors using bathroom and kitchen facilities. He also cautioned against using people’s glasses or cutlery when visiting friends. “It’s just adding additional risk,” Dr De Gascún told RTÉ’s Saturday with Cormac Ó hEadra programme. “If you’re handing me a beer that’s fine, it can go straight into the bin or you can leave it on the wall… but if you’re giving me utensils or delph from your house, I’m seeding the virus on it.”People should avoid interactions over 15 minutes and not meet multiple groups of people in one day, he said. He also advised that people restrict their social interactions to a small circle of friends and family in the coming weeks. Dr de Gascun said it was “likely” there would be an increase in cases following the lifting of restrictions due to people’s movement but that the full impact would not become clear for at least five days. “It’s going to be week two by the time we see what effect lifting restrictions has had.

So the community really is where everything starts and that’s where we want people to stay at home and minimize their interactions because any increase in cases in the community will have a knock on effect to hospitalisation.”Prof Gerry Killeen from UCC’s school of biological earth and environmental sciences, who has worked on malaria transmission control and methods to combat the Zika virus, said it was “absolutely” too soon to be lifting restrictions and that they should remain in place until the end of the summer or early autumn. International data indicates the death rate in Italy and New York is “still the tip of the iceberg of what would happen if we just let this epidemic rip”, he said. Prof Killeen cautioned that while testing and treatment was a vital part of the response to the virus, it would not hold back the spread of the pandemic. Public transport The National Transport Authority (NTA) has said it will continue to operate a revised timetable for bus, train and tram transport services from next Monday with extra capacity to be added across public transport as required.All passengers are advised to wear face coverings when using public transport from next week following Government advice that people use facemasks in crowded indoor locations and when on public transportation as restrictions are lifted. Asked why the wearing of masks on public transport had not been made compulsory, Dr de Gascun said certain people may have problems wearing face coverings because of breathing difficulties or allergies while others may need to see people’s mouths for lip reading. Dr Holohan warned on Friday that “we cannot regard face coverings as some sort of magic shield . . . It’s a supplement to the other measures we are recommending.”“This is an additional hygiene measure, it’s not a magic bullet for this disease, and that has to be understood.”NTA chief executive Anne Graham urged people to only use public transport if their “journey is essential” and to otherwise considering cycling or walking to their destination where feasible.“If public transport is their only option, they should follow public health guidance when travelling,” Ms Graham said. The NTA said any anticipated increase in passenger numbers would be “closely monitored” and that “enhanced daily cleaning” would continue to take place including the daily sanitising of frequently touched surfaces on board all vehicles and at depots and terminal points across the country. Almost all buses, trains and trams are now receiving at least one additional cycle of cleaning during the day, a statement from the transport authority said. The NTA said it would publish proposals “shortly” around the provision of enhanced public transport services in line with the Government’s roadmap for reopening society and that any decisions would be guided by the National Public Health Emergency Team and advice from the chief medical officers. The deaths of a further 16 people from Covid-19 were confirmed by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Friday night as well as an additional 129 cases.There has been anxiety in Government that people will “descend on hardware stores and garden centres in large numbers” once the rules are relaxed on Monday, resulting in a rise in rates of infection.At a press conference in Government Buildings on Friday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar – flanked by Minister for Health Simon Harris, Minister for Business Heather Humphreys and chief medical officer Tony Holohan – said it was a “calculated evidence-based risk to ease the lockdown”.The first phase of the reopening of the country will see construction and other outdoor work permitted, some retail outlets such as hardware – but not homeware – shops allowed to open their doors. Retailers expressed disappointment at the late exclusion of homeware stores but Mr Harris said “now is not the time to decide I’m going to dicky up the house”.Dublin City Council has confirmed that from Monday, allotments, car parks associated with outdoor amenities, tennis courts and golf courses at Silloge and Tolka valley will re-open. The causeway road to the Bull Island Nature Reserve will re-open to vehicles along with a new dedicate cycleway while the number of outdoor staff at work across all service areas will increase. Arrangements are also being made for people returning to work in construction, said the council.

It wants protections of environmental standards and labour rights to be part of the deal, to avoid British industry undercutting EU competitors.Mr Frost said such commitments would bind Britain to EU laws and standards in a way that is unprecedented in other free trade agreements.“It is hard to understand why the EU insists on an ideological approach which makes it more difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. We very much need a change in EU approach for the next round beginning on June 1st. In order to facilitate those discussions, we intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EU’s member states and interested observers can see our approach in detail,” he said.Both sides agreed that there had been slight movement on the issue of fisheries, where each had begun with polar opposite positions, the EU advocating for a continuance of the status quo and Britain insisting it would reclaim exclusive rights for its fishing industry alone in its territorial waters.\u0026nbspTalks on finding a compromise will resume in the next round of negotiations, which begin on June 1st.Britain will next week publish the draft legal texts it has shared with EU negotiators but not with member-state governments. It will also publish a document outlining how it plans to implement the Northern Ireland protocol.‘A bit tetchy’A senior British official close to the negotiations said this week’s talks were “a bit tetchy at times”, adding that Mr Barnier was doing a good job but was burdened with a negotiating mandate that was not negotiable with Britain.“The problem continues to be that the EU think that they can get a halfway house between what we’re willing to see on so-called level playing field and what they’re willing to see, what we’re willing to live with on fisheries and what they’re wanting to see. We tried to make clear from the start that there isn’t a halfway house. You can’t split the difference between areas where we control our own laws and that’s a fundamental difficulty that the EU has not yet accepted,” the official said.After weeks of stalemate and a tight negotiating timetable that was curtailed further by the coronavirus pandemic, calls have grown for Britain to request an extension to the transition period to give the talks more time, which survey data indicates has majority public support.\u0026nbspThe British Irish chamber of commerce appealed to the government of prime minister Boris Johnson to buy time so that businesses were not burdened with tariffs and regulations while at their “most vulnerable”.The British government has insisted it will not ask for an extension, and last week cabinet minister Michael Gove said that tariffs were a “price” London was willing to pay.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

We are seeing a roughly similar pattern everywhere - I suspect we have more immunity than estimated. We need to keep slowing the virus, but it could be petering out by itself.Professor Sikora\u0027s comments come as Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, today (Sunday) announced that the Government would be investing £93m in the construction of the UK\u0027s first dedicated Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC), to be opened in summer next year, 12 months ahead of schedule.A further £38m is being invested in creating a rapid deployment facility in the coming weeks, with the aim of ensuring any successful vaccine developed can be quickly distributed.The VMIC, located on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire, will have the capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months, the Government has said.Sir Mark Walport, chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, described the VMIC as an essential new weapon in the UK\u0027s arsenal which will provide a boost in the race to develop a vaccine by scientists at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London.Mr Sharma said we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions when the breakthrough comes, and this funding will help make that happen.The VMIC\u0027s chief executive, Dr Matthew Duchars, added: “This investment will rapidly accelerate the construction of the facility, enabling us to bring it online a year sooner. In addition, the capacity will be significantly increased, so that enough vaccines could be made for everyone in the UK within a matter of months of opening.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously admitted that an effective coronavirus vaccine may never be found.Speaking at the Downing Street briefing on Monday evening, Mr Johnson said: This is by no means guaranteed. I believe I\u0027m right in saying that even after 18 years we still don\u0027t have a vaccine for Sars.What I can tell you is that the UK is at the forefront of concerting international activity to try to deliver a vaccine.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dithering officials holding back next wave innovation","story":"At the start of the pandemic, China built a hospital in double-quick time and we all thought, “that’s why they are so good at economic growth”. Then Britain did the same, proving we can do it too. Medical devices have been rushed through the approval process in days. Vaccine development is being brilliantly accelerated. We have shown we can do things quickly. Why can’t we do the same in ordinary times?Like every small business owner, I find that quangos always take far, far longer than they need over decisions.A local river trust cleaning out an old fish-pass on a river took several months to get approval from the Environment Agency the work took one day. An attempt to turn derelict farm buildings into shops has so far taken local planning officials seven years to (not yet) decide.Getting permission to extend a track by a hundred yards took Natural England many months of hesitation and several site visits.The problem that faces firms up and down the country is not that regulators say no, but that they take an age to say yes. A local firm has been trying to start a project that would bring 200 good jobs and millions of pounds of tax revenue. It has been through planning permission, an inquiry, an appeal and a court case – winning at every stage. It was promised a ministerial decision last June and is still waiting, five years after applying.From Heathrow Airport’s new runway to notifying you of a medical test result, everything seems to take far longer than necessary.For private enterprise, time is money delay can be lethal. Companies like Amazon, for all their faults, recognise this and promise you rapid delivery. For the public sector, there is no urgency. If the rules state that you must receive a reply within three weeks, then lo and behold, the reply arrives after three weeks, never two.It can take up to six years to get a medical device – a new and faster diagnostic test for viruses, say – licensed in most European countries, including this one. Entrepreneurs cannot wait that long their money runs out. We will never know how many innovations such delays have deterred, but they are surely one of the main reasons we were not better prepared for this pandemic.In 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved a genetically modified variety of potato bred by the German company BASF.The European Commission decided not to decide. So BASF went to court and won. The commission launched another evaluation. The EFSA once again said the potato was safe. But the Hungarian government complained the EU had based its decision on the first approval, instead of the second virtually identical one. A court agreed.By this time, eight years had passed and BASF had tired of banging its head against a brick wall. It withdrew its application, packed up its research team and moved them to America.Instead of raging against the machine, we shrug and treat these delays like the weather we dare not grumble for fear of incurring a further bureaucratic sulk. The trouble is, delay costs civil servants nothing. Indeed, it brings advantages. Not taking a decision increases the chances that you’ll be promoted or moved so the blame for the decision – if it proves unpopular – falls on your successor.Plus the delay enables them to argue they are overworked and under-resourced, so need a bigger budget. This is known as public choice theory.The Highways Agency is planning a road-widening scheme through a sliver of woodland I own. Fine, go ahead, say I. It’s been on the cards for a decade, planned for five years and an active project for two. But no ground has been broken.Ecologists with high-vis jackets and clipboards keep coming out to survey the habitat, the otters, protected species and trees. There is a separate ecologist wearing a high-vis jacket in a separate van for each category.They are now making second or third visits because, they say, too long has elapsed since the first one and they need to check if the trees are still there. The road will be built anyway. But notice: the more visits, the more these ecological consultants earn.China is a dictatorship, but if you don’t annoy the Communist Party, you’re far more free to put up a building, start a research project or open a shop without interminable waits for beadles and busybodies to give you licences. If there is one way to regain rapid growth after Covid, it is surely to incentivise officials to take decisions more quickly. I wish I could think of a way to do that which won’t immediately be gamed, but there must be one. Fast decisions would unlock a tidal wave of entrepreneurial activity which at the moment just gives up.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exorcism now industry uk government ordered inquiry hears","story":"An “industry of exorcisms” has been identified within the UK, a government-ordered inquiry has heard.The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) is continuing to hear evidence regarding allegations of abuse in religious organisations and settings.Groups representing victims and survivors from Muslim, Sikh and south Asian groups told the Inquiry that religious authorities exhibit a “wilfull lack of understanding” regarding abuse. Giving evidence to the Inquiry, which is being chaired by Professor Alexis Jay OBE, one activist representing victims said that she was aware of a “growing” number of exorcisms in the UK.Sadia Hameed, Director of Gloucestershire Sisters, which specialises in  harmful traditional practices including: honour-based violence, forced marriage and FGM, said that folk traditions, including exorcisms are becoming “more prevalent”. “When I was younger, it almost didn’t even exist,” she told the hearing, which is taking place remotely via Zoom. “You might have had someone that would pray and blow on you or pray on some water and give you that water to drink, but now, we’re seeing this industry of exorcisms happening in the UK. “And they might be happening in a mosque setting, or they might happen in somebody’s home where somebody is invited to perform an exorcism, but they’ve certainly grown in prevalence in recent times, I would say in the last decade.”Pragna Patel, director of Southall Black Sisters (SBS), also told the Inquiry on Friday that “the ritualised healing that takes places is often a pretext for sexual abuse”.Earlier in the week the IICSA heard evidence from Moin Azmi, vice chair of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB), said that sexual abuse is “not a rampant issue” within the Muslim community. He told the Inquiry: “The sentencing within Islam is so, so severe that it gives shudders down somebody who even thinks about sexual abuse, and if that’s the foundation of how Muslims think then the majority - I’m not saying that there aren’t sexual abuses - I’m saying the majority have a particular view of this issue.”In November, The  reported that witchcraft child abuse cases had risen by a third in two years, as experts blame “cultural sensitivity” and “political correctness” as barriers to protecting children. Abuse of children based on faith or belief – which includes witchcraft, spirit possession and black magic – increased from 1,460 to 1,950 cases between 201617 and 201819, according to figures released by the Local Government Association (LGA). The statistics came just months a trial at the Old Bailey which saw a mother of a then three-year-old girl become the first person to be convicted of FGM in the UK, following a failed bid to shut up her accusers with witchcraft.The Ugandan woman, 37, and her Ghanaian partner, 43, both from Walthamstow, east London, were accused of cutting their daughter over the 2017 summer bank holiday.Forty limes and other fruit were found with pieces of paper with names written on them stuffed inside, including those of police officers and a social worker involved in the investigation.The spells and curses intended to deter police and social workers from investigating were found at the Ugandan woman\u0027s home, the trial heard. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fish chips enjoying resurgence much loved take away devoured","story":"The familiar sound and smell of Friday fish suppers frying is returning once again to the British high street. Increasing numbers of fish and chip shops are reopening with some selling record numbers of take-away meals as one of the nation’s favourite culinary treats enjoys a resurgence in popularity.The National Federation of Fish Friers (NFFF) estimates nearly 80 per cent of the country’s 10,500 shops have begun trading again as they embrace new technology and social distancing guidelines.While cashless click and collect mobile phone apps stagger collection times to prevent queues, a new kerbside car delivery technique means even the most vulnerable can enjoy crispy cod and chips.“For those shielding or self-isolating they can simply drive up to the fish and chip shop safely in their car, pop open their boot and we place the fish supper inside, close the boot and off home they drive,” said Andrew Crook, NFFF president and owner of Skippers of Euxton in Lancashire. “They don’t even have to open the window.”In the Cheshire town of Knutsford, friers at Hooked on the Heath have become accustomed to placing bags of fish and chips in the front bonnet of footballers’ sports cars.“With supercars they have to pop the bonnet at the front,” said Craig Buckley, the shop owner. “Recently, there was a Lamborghini Urus, two Porsches and a Land Rover in a line waiting for our fish and chips.”Mr Buckley would not say who the sporting superstars were, merely hinting how a lot of footballers who play for Liverpool and Manchester clubs live nearby.“It doesn’t matter who you are or how well off you are, everyone loves fish and chips,” he added.Fish and chips shops closed after the lockdown was announced, leaving farmers with stockpiles of markies and sagitta potatoes, the drier varieties perfect for chipping.When it became clear take-aways could reopen the industry worked with the Government to establish new guidelines.Now, staff working in the kitchens have to pass one another “back to back”, shops often have plastic shields and customers are only allowed inside one at a time, if at all. And cash is out with touchless credit cards, online and mobile phone apps with digital payments the new norm.In Galastonbury’s Knight’s Fish Restaurant, which has been in the same family since 1909, the take-away side of the business is now booming despite only being open nine hours a week.“Fish supper Friday is still the big take-away night - I think it cheers people up,” Kevin Mitchell, who married Charlotte Knight, said as he prepared to open up. “Orders can be big. We had a £70 order from someone buying dinner for the whole street. But, a lot of people are buying for elderly parents where they drop the food off on the doorstep.”This year is the 160th anniversary of the first fish and chips to be served as a complete dish, although it is disputed whether it originated in London or Mossley, near Manchester.Although, fried fish dates back much further with Charles Dickens referring to a “fried fish warehouse” in Oliver Twist, although then served with bread or baked potatoes. The coronavirus means National Fish and Chip Day has been put back from the first Friday in June to September 4.Mr Crook believes the crisis may have changed the industry for good. “People are still finding their feet,” Mr Crook added. “But we are emerging as a more modern industry.”A Defra spokesperson said delivery, take-away and drive-through outlets “play a key role in serving the public” and can open as long as they have strict social distancing procedures in place.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"latin americas indigenous people defend against coronavirus","story":"Deep in the Colombian Andes, José Obeymar Tenorio is on sentry duty.Armed with a simple wooden staff, he belongs to Colombia’s Indigenous Guard, a two thousand strong force whose job is to protect the Nasa reservation in the country’s southwestern Cauca region (see picture below).In one of Colombia’s most violent places, these volunteers are normally the frontline of defence against drug traffickers and insurgents, but now they face the unprecedented challenge of thwarting a global pandemic.The Indigenous Guard patrols 24 hours a day at hundreds of checkpoints throughout Cauca. The movement of people is restricted and only deliveries of essentials are allowed to pass.“It’s our job to keep this virus out,” says Mr Obeymar. “This is about our survival.”Across Latin America, indigenous settlements are isolating themselves from the outside world, concerned the coronavirus poses a serious threat to their existence. In Argentina, members of the Mapuche tribe have set up roadblocks and in Brazil, the Xingu peoples are refusing entry to anyone other than medics. Similar measures have been reported in Guatemala, Chile, Mexico and Nicaragua.Latin America is home to 42 million indigenous people, according to the World Bank. The extraction industries and deforestation have threatened these communities for many years, but the global pandemic presents potentially disastrous consequences.The United Nations says indigenous groups are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. High levels of poverty and malnutrition can severely weaken the immune system. It was the first wave of European colonization in the eighteenth century that introduced diseases like smallpox to Latin America, resulting in millions of deaths among the continent’s native populations.“History tells us we are vulnerable,” said Jhoe (correct spelling) Sauca from the Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca in Colombia. “And we have to save ourselves, nobody else will help us.”In Peru, indigenous groups submitted a formal complaint to the UN in late April, saying the government had left them to fend for themselves against the coronavirus, risking “ethnocide by inaction.” And in neighbouring Ecuador, representatives of The Siekopai nation of just 744 people said they feared being wiped out entirely after confirming 15 cases and two deaths within their community. In the Amazon basin, 180 of the 600 indigenous tribes have reported infections and at least 30 deaths, according to charities working in the rainforest. This week the first cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Vaupés, known as the jewel of the Colombian Amazon, and home to 255 indigenous communities.“This is the biggest threat we have faced for centuries,” said Simón Valencia, leader of the department’s ancestral authorities. “We’re taking urgent action to isolate our people and shield our elders in particular.”Indigenous history is often passed down the generations through storytelling. Traditions and rituals are taught by those who have lived longest.“This could be the end for us,” said Mr Valencia. “If we lose our elders, we lose our culture. Even if we survive, our way of life may not.”Indigenous groups from the nine countries of the Amazon basin are calling for donations to help protect the three million people, who live under the canopy of the rainforest. The Amazon Emergency Fund is being sponsored by the Rainforest Foundation US. Its chief executive, Suzanne Pelletier, told the  the aim was to raise three million dollars in two weeks.“Rainforests are critical to combating the climate crisis and science shows that forests that are owned and managed by Indigenous peoples are healthier,” she said. “This is why supporting and protecting the health of Indigenous peoples is absolutely vital to all the inhabitants of the planet.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"postcard brussels four friends pommes frites safe distance","story":"Nine weeks and counting since Belgium entered lockdown. My wife and I continue to juggle working from home with entertaining our three-year-old son and one-year-old daughter. Belgian households can now welcome up to four visitors but they must always be the same four. It is a social minefield.We rapidly secure a couple with a little girl the same age as our son. We have one slot left. A friend, a single man living alone, comes under our apartment balcony for a quick socially distanced chat.  I ask him if he wants to be the fourth member of our “bubble”. There’s an embarrassed pause before he turns the invite down, pointing out the four of us would fill his entire social quota.At the European Commission’s midday press briefing, chief spokesman Eric Mamer asks journalists to turn their webcams on when asking a question. When my turn comes, Eric exclaims, “James! You need a haircut!”. This is undeniable but, with hairdressers not expected to reopen until next week, unavoidable. Shops have reopened this week under strict conditions. A one way system has been introduced on Brussels’ main shopping street but I will not be returning to the high street today. Face masks, which are obligatory on public transport on pain of a 250 euro fine, are recommended. Some mayors have made them compulsory in certain districts in Brussels.  We venture out to meet our bubble buddies. Cafes are closed but you can always rely on the Belgians when it comes to frites, which should be handcut and fried twice. Maison Antoine, one of Brussels’ most famous chip shops, has reopened and is much less busy than usual. I am served by a fryer in mask and gloves. The supermarket behind me has set up a decontamination stall for customers outside its entrance. We go to a nearby park and eat the frites sitting on the grass as the kids run around. Sharing mayonnaise and samurai sauce is a little awkward but we respect the 1.5 metre rule. It is a refreshing taste of normality. Later, the European Commission sets outs its recommendations to reopen EU borders and save everyone’s summer holidays. They include a suggestion that robots could be used at airports to check passengers’ temperatures and that the 1.5 meter rule is observed. The weather forecast is good, thank God. Rain means no visits to the park for the kids and tears and havoc at home. Playgrounds remain closed and the local park is still policed by officers, who fly drones that bark orders in French, Dutch and English. The petanque players have returned to the public court but the football pitch stays closed. Sophie Wilmes, the prime minister, has said museums could reopen next week. The return of my son’s beloved dinosaur museum, will  be a lifesaver if the Brussels rain returns. His teacher emails to ask when I can come and collect his belongings from the school. I take this as a sign that his school, the level below primary,  won’t be reopening before September. Belgium’s only nudist beach has been shut down, which led to accusations that “moralists” were exploiting the coronavirus pandemic. The stretch on the country’s 40 mile coastline will be needed to create extra space for socially distanced, and more clothed, sunbathers. My day is dominated by Brexit and I am alone in the flat. The UK-EU negotiations are going extremely badly. It is just like old times except everything is happening online. The commission is having technical problems with its webcam system, which has delayed Michel Barnier’s press conference. It now seems very likely that Mr Barnier will be telling Britain off at the exact time my  supermarket delivery arrives. Fortunately, the groceries arrive the minute before he strides to the podium. Bars and restaurants were the first to close and look to be the last to leave lockdown. It is reported that one in three will never reopen. Belgium, which is rightly famous for its beer, is drinking far less of the stuff. Local breweries have taken to delivering crates of beer directly to customers.  The news broke this afternoon that more than 9,000 people had died of Coronavirus since the pandemic hit Belgium, helping cement the country\u0027s place as having the highest per-capita death rate in the world.The Hotel pole, Brussels’ oldest and most famous hotel and a personal favourite, looks set to close.

The epicentre of the European outbreak is now in the east, with the number of cases rising in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, he warned. Countries should use this time wisely and start to strengthen public health systems as well as building capacity in hospitals, primary care and intensive care units, he said. Singapore and Japan understood early on that this is not a time for celebration, it\u0027s a time for preparation. That\u0027s what Scandinavian countries are doing – they don\u0027t exclude a second wave, but they hope it will be localised and they can jump on it quickly,” said Dr Kluge.He also warned that a second wave could coincide with an outbreak of other infectious diseases.“I’m very concerned about a double wave – in the fall, we could have a second wave of Covid and another one of seasonal flu or measles. Two years ago we had 500,000 children who didn\u0027t have their first shot of the measles vaccine, he said. Many experts, including England\u0027s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, have warned that a second wave of the pandemic could be even deadlier than the first, pointing to the 1918-20 Spanish flu pandemic as evidence. When the Spanish flu first emerged in March 1918, it had the hallmarks of the typical seasonal illness – but it then came back in an even more virulent and deadly form in the autumn, eventually killing an estimated 50 million people.Troop movements at the end of the First World War are thought to have accelerated the spread of the disease, which also had a third and fourth wave although these were not as devastating.We know from history that in pandemics the countries that have not been hit early on can be hit in a second wave, said Dr Kluge. What are we going to see in Africa and Eastern Europe? They\u0027re behind the curve – some countries are saying: \u0027We\u0027re not like Italy\u0027 and then, two weeks later, boom! They can unfortunately get hit by a second wave, so we have to be very very careful.In the last couple of weeks, many European countries have started unlocking their shuttered economies and allowing some resumption of normal life.Earlier this month, the Spanish population was allowed to exercise outside for the first time in seven weeks, and restaurants in some areas of Germany have reopened. In France, people will no longer need travel permits to explain why they have left home.But in the absence of an effective treatment for the virus, or a vaccine, Dr Kluge said any lockdown had to be accompanied by rigorous public health measures including comprehensive contact tracing and testing. A pilot NHS contact tracing app was launched on the Isle of Wight last week, with the Government saying it would be rolled out to the rest of the country by the end of the month if it proves successful.The number of tests being carried out has been growing slowly but is still not at the 100,000-a day-level promised by Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary. Analysis by the  shows that around 80,000 tests a day are being carried out. Dr Kluge said the lack of a treatment or vaccine meant any easing of lockdown restrictions had to be done gradually and carefully, adding: People think lockdown is finished. Nothing has changed. The full disease control package has to be in place. That\u0027s the key message. He said that he hoped the pandemic had shown that health should now be at the top of the political agenda.We always thought that health was the driver of economic prosperity, but it\u0027s worse – where there\u0027s no health, there’s no economy, he added. This is a lesson that cannot be forgotten. Public health deserves its place at the top of the agenda.

Signs are taped on train and bus seats indicating which ones have to remain empty, with markers on the floor to ensure social distancing. People arriving at Termini train station in Rome also had their body temperatures taken by the staff.Similar measures have been taken in Milan, where plans have also been brought forward for 70 km of new cycle lanes along with the expansion of pedestrian areas (see picture below).However, hundreds of commuters were photographed waiting at Termini last week with social distancing rules not being followed, with others shown leaving stations in Naples and Milan in large numbers also appearing to flout the one metre spacing required.Spanish transport authorities are preparing for a return to something like normal levels of demand by ensuring that passengers have access to protection against the spread of Covid-19.Zaragoza’s buses and tram cars are fitted with hand sanitizing gel dispensers, while Barcelona’s  subway stations are installing vending machines for face masks, the use of which is obligatory in all forms of public transport in Spain.At  stations in Bilbao and the entrances to Basque regional train services, random temperature checks are taking place to dissuade people with illness from travelling. Those caught with a fever are not allowed to travel.Government rules state that alternate seats must remain empty, and maximum standing capacity is set at two commuters per square metre.One Madrid , the country’s busiest public transport system, a system based on AI is being developed that will automatically shut turnstiles when capacity in a station is reached.But the system has already returned to more than half its usual daily capacity this week, despite the capital not yet having opened bars, restaurants or shops and with all schools closed.  Madrid region’s transport secretary, Ángel Garrido said: “We have to lose our fear of the virus, and that’s why face masks have been made obligatory.”The New York subway’s 24-hour service has been reduced for the first time in its 110-year history.In an unprecedented move, New York City’s politan Transportation Authority (MTA) from May 6 began closing all 472 subway stations for four hours every night from 1am until 5am in order to disinfect the carriages (see picture below).They are using ultraviolet light, which is good at killing organic material though not yet known whether it is effective in destroying the novel coronavirus.For essential workers who need to take the subway during the early morning hours, the state and city has laid on a free, alternate service on buses, coaches, and even for-hire vehicles.The MTA has also installed blue markings spaced six feet apart on platforms in normally busy Manhattan stations to encourage social distancing and last month deployed transparent vinyl barriers on roughly 400 buses that cordon off the first few rows of seats.Officials are also testing plexiglass barriers that encapsulate drivers in a see-through bubble. In the crowded public transport systems of Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, the widespread wearing of masks is seen as the key to protecting commuters from being infected with Covid-19.In Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, the wearing of face masks has long been an accepted norm during flu season, but it has now been made compulsory on public transport (see picture below), with fines of $100 to $500 for anyone who does not comply. A free mask is given to anyone who simply forgets to bring one, or they can be picked up in shops in major stations.In the busiest stations, where social distancing is impossible, health officials monitor screens that measure the body temperatures of passers-by, triggering an alarm if anyone measures more than 37.5 degrees Celsius.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/07/15/blackhurst-canary-wharf-london.jpg","title":"coronavirus global economy impact gdp covid 19","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Containing spread of virus key to limiting economic damage, says Asian Development BankCoronavirus could cut global economic output by as much as $8.8 trillion (£7.3 trillion), with the outlook having worsened significantly in the past month, the Asian Development Bank has said.The bank warned on Friday that Covid-19 would result in $5.8 trillion to $8.8 trillion of lost gross domestic product ⁠– or 6.4 per cent to 9.7 per cent of the world’s output. That’s more than twice as bad as the ADB forecast in April.However, government measures to mitigate the economic impact could reduce that figure by as much as 40 per cent, ADB’s chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs some countries, including the UK, lay out plans to ease lockdowns and get more people back to work, Mr Sawada cautioned that containing the pandemic is key to reducing the economic cost. Testing, tracing, isolation, effective social distancing, and securing protective and medical equipment are all “essential elements” of containing Covid-19, he said.

For all of this, having adequate data and information is key.”His words came as the UK government faced criticism from scientists over its easing of lockdown restrictions this week.The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned on Tuesday that the UK faces “inevitable” future lockdowns if the government implements its “potentially dangerous” coronavirus strategy.Ministers laid out plans this week to get sectors including construction and manufacturing back to work, and to restart the housing market.However, the government was accused of confusing people with it’s new message to “stay alert”, replacing a previous instruction to “stay at home”.The number of deaths in the UK has fallen in recent days but the Independent Sage, an alternative to the government’s official scientific advisory panel, said numbers of infections were still too high to implement an effective policy of tracking, tracing and isolating cases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The comments came after a CNBC report that said multiple anonymous AI researchers said they saw Musk’s views on the technology as inappropriate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAn AI executive speaking to CNBC, who asked to remain anonymous because their company may work for one of Musk’s businesses, said that “A large proportion of the community think he’s a negative distraction.”He is sensationalist, he veers wildly between openly worrying about the downside risk of the technology and then hyping the AGI (artificial general intelligence) agenda. Whilst his very real accomplishments are acknowledged, his loose remarks lead to the general public having an unrealistic understanding of the state of AI maturity.”It’s time to draw the curtain on celebrity businessmen like Musk“AGI” stands for “artificial general intelligence,” which is the hypothetical benchmark whereby a machine can learn anything that a human being could. This is distinct from \u0027standard\u0027 artificial intelligence, which is when a machine is capable of carrying out a task like a human could, such as voice recognition in Siri or Alexa.Another specialised focused on speech recognition said that Musk is “not always looked upon favourably,” while an AI researcher at a UK university said that they “instinctively fall on dislike, because he makes up such nonsense.”“But then he delivers such extraordinary things. It always leaves me wondering, does he know what he’s doing? Is all the visionary stuff just a trick to get an innovative thing to market?” they continued.On Twitter, Pesenti said that many people in the AI community would be happy to criticise Musk publicly, stating that Musk “has no idea what he is talking about when he talks about AI. There is no such thing as AGI and we are nowhere near matching human intelligence.”While Facebook team declined to give an official comment, Pesenti said that it was his “personal opinion” but that others at the company – including Yann LeCun, a professor at New York University and a Chief AI Scientist at Facebook and Edward Grefenstette, a Facebook AI Research Scientist – agreed.LeCun quote-tweeted Musk’s disparaging comment, saying that Tesla’s engineers still needed access to Facebook’s PyTorch to develop their products. PyTorch is a free, open source machine learning library primarily developed by Facebok’s AI Research lab.The researchers, Tesla, and SpaceX were contacted by The Independent for comment.

The BBC hosted a TV special on the night of the would-be grand final on 16 May titled Eurovision: Come Together, as part of a wider celebration taking place all this week. The Come Together show was hosted by Graham Norton it reflected on the UK’s best Eurovision moments, past and present, and was ultimately won by Eurovision stars ABBA and their performance of “Waterloo”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe BBC organised a number of shows to lift the spirits of Eurovision fans everywhere, starting with...In February, BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat began filming a documentary that follows the UK’s Eurovision entrant, James Newman, through rehearsals, as well as backstage during the live debut of his Eurovision song, “My Last Breath”.The documentary jumps to when the contest was cancelled, and interviews Newman as he reveals what the cancellation means for him. Other contestants speak about how their experiences of Eurovision differ, and what their future plans are.Eurovision 2020: The Cancelled Coronavirus Year is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer, and on the BBC Newsbeat YouTube channel.Eurovision at 60In 2015, Eurovision at 60 aired on BBC to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the song contest. It includes interviews with Graham Norton, Eurovision champion Conchita Wurst, and the late Sir Terry Wogan.Eurovision viewers moved to tears as monuments around Europe light upABBA crowned the UK’s favourite ever act at Eurovision: Come TogetherEurovision Song Contest winners ranked from worst to bestFifty years ago, an 18-year-old schoolgirl left the Bogside in Ireland and journeyed to Amsterdam to represent her country in the 15th Eurovision Song Contest. Against the odds, she won! Dana: The Original Derry Girl looks back at the life of Dana, and how she became Ireland’s first-ever Eurovision winnerGraham Norton hosted Eurovision: Come Together, a one-off TV special that gave the UK a chance to vote for their favourite Eurovision performances.The event was ultimately won by ABBA performing “Waterloo”.Right after the Come Together show you’ll get to watch Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light, which will honour all of the 41 songs that would have competed in the 2020 contest in Rotterdam.This non-competitive show was broadcast across Europe, just like the usual contest, with a special hosted by the original Dutch presenters who were supposed to present the live event this year: Chantal Janzen, Edsilia Rombley, and Jan Smit from the Netherlands. Graham Norton provided additional commentary. A virtual singalong also took place, with fans dressing up in costume and forming a huge Eurovision choir, which will perform “What’s Another Year”, Ireland’s winning song originally performed by Johnny Logan.The liveblog is now closedBBC show Come Together includes performances by Mahmood and Bucks FizzSee a ranking of every Eurovision winner ever!Vote for your favourite performanceRead about the Russell Crowe-approved Iceland representativesHere\u0027s what\u0027s been happening over the past couple of months.As an alternative to the Song Contest, our Eurovision Correspondent Rob Holley has\u0026nbspbeen running #EurovisionAgain watch-a-longs on Saturday nights, where disappointed\u0026nbspfans of the contest have been simulcasting contests from years past, with legendary ESC participants tweeting along too. Katrina (of the Waves), Alexander Rybak and Dami Im have all dipped in to the #EurovisionAgain twitter stream, providing insights into their time at the world’s biggest pop party.The EBU have enjoyed the fan-run project some much that they’ve started to source classic contests (the pre-2004 Eurovisions are usually mired in complex copyright conundrums, but the original broadcasters have been happy to help during these weird times) to debut them on the official Eurovision YouTube channel! Nearly 200,000 uses of #EurovisionAgain have made it the most popular Twitter trending topic on a Saturday night, dwarfing primetime shows like Britain’s Got Talent on the popular social media platform.Rob says: “It’s really been great for the fans. We’ve been able to e deep in to nostalgia while raising loads of money for some really brilliant charities”.As well as tweeting along, fans have raised over £14,000 for the charities Mermaids, Terrence Higgins Trust and Stonewall, often chipping in a tenner on a weekly basis in return for being entertained. On top of watching the show, Rob and friends also open the virtual phone lines and run a vote which attracts thousands of participants, and often gives a scoring outcome different to the original broadcast.“Schlager a Carola knocked Lordi off the Athens 2006 podium, which I wasn’t happy about - but Scooch did jump 14 places at our screening on Helsinki 2007, so there is an amount of justice being dished out, Rob says.\u0026nbspInstead of reporting from Rotterdam for the Independent, Rob has been publishing his interviews with 2020 participants as the podcast VISION AGAIN, for those wanting to know what the disappointed acts thought of their chances and whether they’ll be invited back.“It’s been really great and I’ve been lucky to get some of the biggest names onto the podcast. I chatted to Iceland’s Daði Freyr, favourite to win with Think About Things, who said he’d be interested to compete at 2021 should he be asked and the right song comes around, he says.\u0026nbsp“Similarly, UK act James Newman also wants a shot too –\u0026nbsphe’s busy gearing up to release his new single \u0027Enough\u0027, but Eurovision remains the goal, and getting way ahead of the game is Ireland’s Lesley Roy, who told me she’s already started plotting an absolute banger for next year. With an extra 12 months under their belts to write epic entries, expect 2021 to blast away all the disappointment of Eurovision being cancelled.”But it’s not all great news: “Other acts like The Mamas from Sweden won’t necessarily be gifted a golden ticket because the national final selection shows are too big not to go ahead., Rob explains. Sweden’s Melodifestivalen is just this huge pop behemoth, so if they want to go to Rotterdam they have to compete again.So what\u0027s actually happening at 6.25pm?Graham Norton is hosting\u0026nbspEurovision: Come Together, a one-off TV special that gives the UK a chance to vote for their favourite Eurovision performances.The choices will come from a short list of artists who will all give virtual performances on the night, and\u0026nbspthe public will be given the chance to vote for their favourites.A reminder of WHAT ON EARTH IS HAPPENING tonight:\u0026nbspQuite a lot, actually, starting with Eurovision: Come Together at 6.25pm on BBC1. The show is a celebration of Eurovision past and present presented by Graham Norton, and will include a vote on your favourite out of a short list of contestants (also past and present).Right after that there\u0027s Europe Shine a Light, a live broadcast which the European Broadcasting Union is airing\u0026nbspin 45 countries + as an online show.There\u0027s no official competition this year, but you can bet I\u0027m going to be passing judgement on each and every one of the performances with my usual sparkling wit.Now we\u0027re seeing Dami Im and her performance of ‘Sound of Silence’, which won the jury vote for Australia in 2016...\u0026nbspbut then came fourth in the public vote and ended up second overall... Dami ultimately lost to Ukraine, who didn’t win either vote. Yes, the voting system is mad and it was a weird year.Feel free to compensate by voting for her (and that incredible dress) this year instead.The A-Z of EurovisionYes, there’s more! Rylan Clark-Neal narrated The A-Z of Eurovision at 10pm on Saturday 16 May, this time on BBC2. The special took us through all of the disasters, outlandish costumes and other memorable moments that have taken place over 65 years of Eurovision.Hosted by Steve Wright, this Eurovision-themed special was originally shown at the beginning of the 2007 edition of the competition.Catchup with all of the 2020 Eurovision broadcasts on YouTube and BBC iPlayer.

The accords are named in keeping with the Artemis programme, which is the plan to send the first woman and next man to the moon by 2024.They would include a commitment to be transparent in their work, to only explore space for “peaceful purposes”, and to guarantee they would work together to save any astronauts that came into danger during a mission.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNasa was explicit that the agreements would be made in keeping with the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which currently sets the legal framework for space exploration. That requires a set of commitments from countries which are intended to ensure that space missions are as safe and transparent as possible.But the new Artemis Accords go further than those commitments, requiring more detailed principles from the countries prepared to work with the US to head to the moon and beyond.Nasa reveals Tesla car that will drive astronauts to new launch“While Nasa is leading the Artemis programme, international partnerships will play a key role in achieving a sustainable and robust presence on the moon while preparing to conduct a historic human mission to Mars,” the agency said on its website.“With numerous countries and private sector players conducting missions and operations in cislunar space, it’s critical to establish a common set of principles to govern the civil exploration and use of outer space.”In full, the principles are that any mission should be conducted with peaceful purposes should be transparent and use technology that is interoperable and conforms to open, international standards that everyone can use. International partners also have to agree to provide emergency assistance to astronauts in trouble publicly register any space objects release the scientific data they gather protect the heritage of historic space artefacts gather resources according to international agreements not harmfully interfere with other missions and dispose of any debris or spacecraft responsibly.When drafts of the accords were leaked earlier this month, they attracted ire from Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos. He suggested on Twitter that the US was planning to invade the moon like it had Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the accords would be a way of building a coalition of other countries that would allow for it to take over the lunar surface.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Representatives also indicated that they hope for Russia to sign a version of the accords.As well as drawing criticism from Russia, the accords appear to be something of a rebuke to the Chinese space programme, which has traditionally been less transparent than the US. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine explicitly referenced the problems around its recent rocket launch as an example of where the accords could help.“The empty core stage of the Long March 5B, weighing nearly 20 tons, was in an uncontrolled free fall along a path that carried it over Los Angeles and other densely populated areas,” Mr Bridenstine told Ars Technica.“I can think of no better example of why we need the Artemis Accords. It’s vital for the US to lead and establish norms of behaviour against such irresponsible activities. Space exploration should inspire hope and wonder, not fear and danger.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s just horrible to think of it in this day and age. I’ve had help from some brilliant volunteers too. I’ve got three young girls at home and I hope they’re learning something about giving back to the community from all this.“I think The Felix Project is doing fantastic work right now. Stopping food going to waste is such a brilliant thing.”Tim Young decided last month to start volunteering with Bread n Butter: a social enterprise in Barnet getting up to 600 cooked meals and food parcels out each day, thanks to around 80 crates of produce supplied weekly by The Felix Project.The 55-year-old – who is still recovering from a heart operation he had earlier this year – has been cooking up to 150 meals a week from his own kitchen.“I’m relatively lucky, I’ve got quite a big kitchen and lots of pots and pans – so I wanted to do what I could. It’s hard to see how much people are struggling at the moment, because the level of need seems to be going up and up. But it’s a pretty good feeling being able to help others out.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The social enterprise adapted to the crisis by delivering free meals to vulnerable people’s doors and NHS hospitals.“I thought they were doing such important work, so I was delighted to lend a hand and do some of the cooking,” said Mr Young. “The Felix Project is doing amazing work too and all the food they’re supplying is fantastic. I’m so glad it isn’t going to waste. It’s going to the people who need it most.”The Felix Project has quadrupled its deliveries since the beginning of the lockdown to 40 tons a day, and supplies more than 100 charities, school groups, hostels and community hubs across London.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups across the UK that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There was an 81 per cent increase in emergency food parcels given out during the last two weeks of March compared to the same period in 2019.Warning that the enormous level of need was likely to continue, she said: “If would be false of me to say we can continue to meet indefinitely an unspecified level of increased demand.”How to support our campaignThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is seeking to raise £10m for the food surplus charity The Felix Project so it can provide food for NHS staff, the poor and elderly who are unable to afford supplies or remain stuck at home for health reasons.The Trussell Trust chief said food aid charities had done “incredible work” since the beginning of the outbreak, and said more than 50 per cent of food banks had adapted to the lockdown by doing home deliveries.However, Ms Revie argued that unless the government strengthened the financial safety net, the UK would continue to see “the kind of destitution that drives people to food banks”.She added: “The problem is people falling into financial hardship. The answer to financial hardship is not food. We are treating one symptom of an underlying problem … The issue we must be focusing on reducing the flow of people into foodbanks.”Advocating a “cash-first approach”, Ms Revie said: “If we’re identifying families in financial hardship ⁠– the most straightforward and dignified response is to provide them with the cash.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I was having a Zoom drink with a friend and it got to a stage where I was so exhausted. I thought maybe I was just a bit hungover or was in a weird mood but then it continued and I felt exhausted the next night on another Zoom call.”How to support our campaignHer condition deteriorated rapidly. “I was having to consciously remember to breathe,” she added. “My lungs hurt. It was really scary. I was an alien for a while, I could barely speak. I wasn’t sure if I would make it.”Ms Khan rang 111, who told her to wait it out at home and see if she got worse. But within days, she said she couldn’t even walk. “I felt weak and dizzy. I couldn’t move at all, I was just on the sofa, trying to remember to breathe. I thought I might be having a heart attack or a stroke. My left side felt numb.”A friend called 999 on her behalf and medics came to her home. Ms Khan said: “They checked my vitals and they were happy enough with me. My oxygen levels were OK\u0026nbspand they said it might be that I was fatigued.“They said sometimes people get another blow when they are almost over the virus and that is what probably happened to me. It felt like an exorcism.” At the peak of her illness, Ms Khan went online to seek help. The artist, whose mother is in her seventies and is isolating so could not provide support, found out about Help The Hungry via Facebook, where she was connected with Made In Hackney.For the past three weeks, the musician\u0026nbsphas been receiving daily meals via the organisation.

Its 48 coaches run a range of sports programmes, including basketball, tennis, table tennis, volleyball and yoga.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLuca Toth, a head coach at the charity, taught volleyball at the Central Foundation Girls’ School in Tower Hamlets. She tells The Independent: “I see sports coaching as a tool to get close to the girls and be a mentor figure. We teach them teamwork, to persevere and to handle disappointment.”Some 67 per cent of the young people Greenhouse mentors live in postcodes classed as “deprived”. Just north of the Greenhouse Sports Centre in Marylebone lies Church Street Ward, one of the most deprived wards nationally. Figures from 2017 suggest more than half of children in the area live in poverty.How to support our campaignA spokesperson for Greenhouse tells The Independent: “Lockdown came in and suddenly kids were completely cut off. One child could have had a breakfast club, a lunch club, a PE session and an afternoon sports session with us. A lot of the kids are going back to home lives that are very difficult, in confined spaces.”Some children that it mentors come from families where sport is not seen as a cultural priority. Others do not speak English at home. “The Joe Wicks PE experience might not actually cut through to them.”Joel Archard, a father of three, calls Greenhouse “a beacon of the community” over the phone with The Independent. His daughter Luna, now 12 years old, plays table tennis with Maria, another coach and mentor. “They didn’t let the lockdown stop them. They do zoom calls, and ask ‘how are you doing?’. It gives the kids a bit of structure to their lives.Greenhouse is also preparing for the end of lockdown. “Everything is pointing to the fact that the recession will hit the kind of families we deal with hardest, especially young people who have missed school,” says a spokesperson.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It now delivers close to 100 food packages a day.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project and former COO of Greenhouse Sports, says: “The Felix Project is proud to have worked closely with Greenhouse Sports for many years. During this health crisis it’s great to see them open up their amazing sports centre at the heart of the local community. We applaud their innovation.”Help The Hungry campaign to feed vulnerable Londoners raises over £4mVolunteers cook for neighbours struggling without food during crisisMarathons and piggy-back challenges help The Independent raise £3.7mTwo other organisations that have innovated to support our campaign under lockdown are Holland \u0026amp Barrett and Daylesford Organic. Holland \u0026amp Barrett, a regular supplier of The Felix Project, has donated 2,000 units of vitamin D for elderly people stuck at home at risk of deficiency.Daylesford Organic has released a range of fermented vegetables with Felix Project branding. The farm shop offers “ferments” of radish and butternut squash as “unusual” garnishes for meals or cocktails. It expects to raise an additional £10,000 per year, and all profits from the products go to the charity.Luca, the volleyball coach from Greenhouse, expresses her concern about her children’s welfare through this crisis. “There is probably no privacy for many of the kids sharing rooms. I’m worried that the ones who were ok when we left will suffer, and those who weren’t ok at the beginning will come back worse.“We are dealing with so many people who need us. I have seen what a change we have made in these people’s lives.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

We couldn’t be prouder to donate and help them to get food to people in the most difficult situations.”Another supplier to go the extra mile is Reach Food Service, a provider of premium ingredients to London’s gourmet restaurants, which has donated £10,000.In addition it has pledged £1 for every home delivery during 2020 of its newly launched Reach My Kitchen initiative – dispensing meat, seafood and poultry ingredients normally reserved for London’s top chefs directly to households – and which it estimates will raise its total donation to £50,000.Other food-linked organisations that have already supported our appeal include The Daylesford Foundation, which donated £100,000, and Hello Fresh with £25,000.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Same with Müller – their contribution has quadrupled.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in The Independent, said: “Our Food for London Now campaign has raised £4m in just seven weeks. With more than 1,500 reader donations, and the support of London companies, we have reached heights few expected.“We have told the stories of the people who are suffering during this pandemic. The homeless, the unemployed, the isolated. And we have saluted the innovative people who have applied their skills to helping them in this crisis.“The capital has heard our call, but the hunger crisis has not peaked – just look at the grim economic news from this week. We have committed to raising £10m to ensure the food security of Londoners for three years.

Murtaza Lakhani, its owner, said: “The twin issues of food waste and hunger are having major impacts on London.

The cash brings the total public and private sector funding for the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC) to £207m.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“As the biggest contributor to the international coalition to find a vaccine, the UK is leading the global response,” said the business secretary. “Once a breakthrough is made, we need to be ready to manufacture a

be the UK’s first not-for-profit organisation for the mass production of vaccines and is intended to boost the national capacity to develop and produce inoculations for existing illnesses such as the flu virus.VMIC chief executive Dr Matthew Duchars said: “Today’s announcement by the business secretary is an important endorsement for the work the Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre will

investment will rapidly accelerate the construction of the facility, enabling us to bring it online a year sooner. In addition, the capacity will be significantly increased, so that enough vaccines could be made for everyone in the UK within a matter of months of opening.”The chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, Sir Mark Walport, said the centre would be “an essential new weapon in the UK’s arsenal against diseases and other biological threats, ensuring sufficient vaccines get to the public in the fastest possible time”.He added: “The UKRI-funded teams at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London have developed potential coronavirus vaccines at unprecedented speed. By working with partners including government, VMIC and the Vaccines Taskforce to fast-track the manufacturing capability, we are ensuring that momentum will continue all the way from lab to patient.”The government is the largest national donor to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), with a gift of £250m as part of a total £388m contribution to the global hunt for a vaccine.

Penny Gaines, chair of the Stop HS2 campaign, said: “We have said for years that HS2 was struggling to keep costs under control and the schedule was long since unachievable.  HS2 should be cancelled as soon as possible.”But the Department for Transport insisted that new governance arrangements introduced by transport secretary Grant Shapps would ensure tight control of costs.Today’s report found that both DfT and HS2 Ltd were aware of time and cost problems as early as October 2018, and the company formally notified the department the following March that it could not deliver phase one of the programme, between London and Birmingham, on schedule or within budget.But the committee said it was not until the autumn of 2019 that the transport secretary revealed that the estimated bill for the project had risen from £55.7bn to £65-£88bn in 2015 prices – the equivalent of up to £100bn now – and the first trains would be delayed by as much as seven years. Boris Johnson later gave the go-ahead for construction work on the scheme to begin in April.Ms Kelly withheld her knowledge that the programme was in serious difficulties when asked directly about the budget and delivery timeline by MPs in two appearances before the committee alongside HS2 executives in October 2018 and May 2019, the report found.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The PAC said there was “no justification” for hiding the scale of the financial crisis, and said the DfT had given “no adequate excuse” for the lack of transparency.As accounting officer for the programme, Ms Kelly conducted four assessments during 2019 on whether it remained justified in terms of the four grounds of feasibility, regularity, propriety and value for money, but did not share them with parliament as required, the report found.Her failure to provide accurate information to parliament was “potentially a breach of the civil service code and a breach of parliamentary privilege”, said the report, in a charge with DfT firmly rejects.“With so many people’s homes and livelihoods affected by the construction of the railway, there is no justification for the department and HS2 Ltd having been so opaque about the delays and budget overruns,” said the committee.“The High Speed Two programme has gone badly off course … We are unconvinced that there will not be further cost increases, such as those we have seen in Crossrail and many other programmes, especially given that the route and forecast cost of the northern sections of the proposed railway is still very uncertain and will remain so for years to come.”The report found that lack of transparency over cost had undermined public confidence in HS2, which is currently due to begin services between London and Birmingham between 2029 and 2033 and extend to Leeds and Manchester between 2036 and 2040.The forecast cost of undertakings and assurances made during the passage of HS2 legislation through parliament has “exploded” from £245m to £1.2bn, the MPs noted.PAC chair Meg Hillier said the committee was now demanding “an honest, open account and evidence of learning from past mistakes” in regular six-monthly reports from the DfT.“There is no excuse for hiding the nature and extent of the problems the project was facing from parliament and the taxpayer,” she said.“The government unfortunately has a wealth of mistakes on major transport infrastructure to learn from, but it does not give confidence that it is finally going to take those lessons when this is its approach.”The committee’s deputy chair Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said the report was “one of the most critical, in both the transparency of government and the handling of a project, that I have seen in my nine years in total on the committee”.Ms Kelly’s failure to inform the committee of HS2’s troubles was “a serious breach of the department’s duty to parliament and hence to the public”, he said.A DfT spokesperson said: “The current secretary of state has been clear that this project must go forward with a new approach to parliamentary reporting, with clear transparency, strengthened accountability to ministers, and tight control of costs.“This includes appointing the first dedicated HS2 minister, bi-annual updates to parliament and establishing a monthly ministerial task force, chaired by the secretary of state, to ensure the project has a rigorous scrutiny like the 2012 Olympics.”The DfT said that Ms Kelly had acknowledged in May 2019 that the project was facing cost pressures, but said that discussions to resolve them were commercially confidential.Department for Transport\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

They seem to react much better to Caravaggio than Monet. And these are Peruvian penguins, so we were speaking a bit in Spanish, and they really appreciated art history.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

but its all conditional on the continued decline of the virus.Speaking during a televised address, the PM said: At the earliest by June  – after half term – we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year  and Year .He also revealed the governments desire to get secondary students working with their teachers ahead of their exams.Mr Johnson added: Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays.And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.It is hoped once the first children , a staggered plan could be laid out to get the rest back to lessons.The government believe getting schools moving is key, as it will allow parents to thento work and help get the economy going again.Previously, a government source said: Ministers are determined to give every child the chance to get back into the classroom in some form before schools break up for summer.But on Saturday, Gavin Williamson suggested children in Years  and  could join primary school kids in ing to full time education on  June.The Education Secretary revealed during the Downing Street press conference that pupils in Year  and Year  will be back on a limited basis to help them plan for exams next year.He said schools would only rates of infection continue to decrease and give a green light.The Department for Education issued guidelines on May  on how schools should enforce social distancing - including limiting class sizes to  students.Schools are told to stagger lunch and break times, as well as drop-off and pick-up times, to reduce the number of pupils moving around at once.It also said schools should look at bringing in a one-way system in corridors, or putting a ider in the middle to control the flow of kids.Ministers admitted they cannot keep kids two metres away from each other all day, so each class will form a self-contained bubble so they dont mix with other kids at the schools.But Mr Whiteman said even with just  students - it would be dficult to have social distancing in classrooms.He told MPs there isnt enough understanding of the scientic basis to instil confidence in parents that it was safe for kids toto classrooms.However, the PMs plans came under fire as the boss of the National Education Union- the biggest teaching union in the UK - urged , members not to engage with the plans.Union boss Kevin Courtney tweeted on May : Education unions intend to work together.Dont engage with planning a June stto wider opening - await further union advice.Meanwhile, General Secretary of The National Association for Head Teachers Paul Whiteman told the Education Select Committee: If social distancing is as we understand it now - the two metre rule to be applied in schools - there are very many schools that are saying it is simply impossible to achieve. He said making sure younger year groups stay at least two metres apart from each other and their teachers and practice good hygiene such as hand washing will be particularly dficult.No has also confirmed that parents would not be finedthey chose to keep their kids at home over concerns for their safety.A spokesman for No said today: While we will not penalise [parents] for keeping children at home, once children are eligible toto school we will strongly encourage them to do so.Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: We think that the announcement by the Government that schools may reopen from June  with reception and years one and six is nothing short of reckless.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on May  it was completely natural for parents to worry about sending their kids back to school.He told ITV: The reason weve said what we have is actually because homeschooling and telly schooling for five- and six-year-olds, in Year  and in Reception, is much harder.We do want to make sure that education is interrupted as little as possible.Also, childcare is much more dficultyouve got a five-year-old, six-year-old or a child in pre-school.President of the Directors of Childrens ServicesJenny Coles said schools would at least five or six weeks to get ready for kids to be back behind desks safely.Asked whether teachers would be issued with personal protective equipment, Robert Jenrick previously said face coverings were only recommended for enclosed spaces such as public transport.He said: Teachers and staff in non-residential schools will not need personal protective equipmentwhen schools start toto full capacity.On Friday, following a meeting between teachers unions and chief scientic advisors, a Downing Street  spokesman reiterated the comments.The spokesperson added PPE should not be necessary for teachers, unless they were giving close care to a child with symptoms.A recent survey of , school staff across the UK conducted by education magazine Tes found % wanted PPE when schools open fully.Of the survey respondents who said they felt PPE will be needed, % say it should include a face mask covering nose and mouth, and % say it should include eye protection or aprons and gowns.The government wants to start getting pupils back in school from June, with primary school students the first to .Mr Johnson said reception, Year  and Year , would be the first toto the classroom.He said: At the earliest by June  – after half term – we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year  and Year .GCSE and A-level students could be allowed to spend time with their teachers before the holidays.Those facing exams next year are being prioritised by the government.The Prime Minister said: Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays.And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.Exams have been cancelled, leaving hard-working teenagers in a dficult, stressful and frustrating place around their futures.However, the PM gave students facing exams a glimmer of hope by revealing the governments plans to allow pupils to spend some time with their teachers.Meanwhile, the exam regulator, Ofqual, and exam boards will work with teachers to provide grades to students whose exams have been cancelled this summer. Exam boards will not be issuing any papers or tests at all.The government is using a mix of student performance criteria that include teacher assessments, mock exam grades and overviews of a pupils general work.According to the government website, all students who were due to sit an A level, AS level or GCSE exams this summer will receive a calculated grade based on mock exams results and non-exam assessments.The Department for Education has stressed that students will not be issued predicted grades as this would not be fair.The calculated grades will be formal grades, however, and will be given the same status as grades awarded in any other year, so will be accepted by colleges and universities.For more information visit the government website here.The government guidelines say: The calculated grades awarded will be formal grades, with the same status as grades awarded in any other year.University representatives expect universities to be flexible and do all they can to support students and ensure they can progress to higher education.There is a lot of worry over how that will play out in practice, particularly for underprivileged students or kids who just didnt take the mock exams as seriously as the real deal.If a student does not believe the correct process has been followed in their case they will be able to appeal on that basis.In addition,they do not feel their calculated grade reflects their performance, they will have the opportunity to sit an exam, as soon as is reasonably possible after schools and colleges open again.Students will also have the option to sit their exams in summer .There are plenty of online learning s for homeschooled children, with YouTube videos being popular.The BBC has also released Bitesize Daily.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s just the way these people operate.”Tiger King has kept us glued to our television sets during lockdown as we marvel at the self-proclaimed “gay, gun-carrying red neck” Joe Exotic and his Oklahoma zoo.While his tiger breeding scene might seem a million miles away from our shores, there are scores of big cat owners right here in the UK.A Freedom of Information request by the Born Free charity shows that , wild animal licences have been handed out by local authorities in Britain - and the success of Tiger King is likely to encourage even more applications.Thomas lives with his girlfriend Celine Timmerman, , in rural Staffordshire and holds a licence that allows him to keep  unusual pets including foxes and snakes.He comes from a long line of animal trainers and performed in a travelling circus until  when the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsrefused to renew his licence, sparking a high profile court battle that he lost.Given that he was one of only a few big cat trainers working in a UK circus, he was dubbed ‘Britain’s Last Lion Tamer’ ahead of a nationwide ban on the acts this year.Today his male tiger Altai, aged nine, and two male African lions called Tsavo and Assegai, both , live in a  sq ft enclosure beside his house where he feeds them discarded meat from the local abattoir.“I have to work harder to keep them stimulated and provide extra enrichment now they are not performing in the circus, he says.“I put dferent toys in their enclosures, I spray perfume around and put in leafy branches and scent boxes.“I’m very attached to the animals and they are receptive to that.“I can kiss one of the lions and put my arm around him because he trusts me.The trainer has been dogged by outrage over his shows in the past, with protesters taking to the streets supported by the RSPCA and Peta.During a  tour of Wales, he was forced to deny claims the lions and tigers, which were bred in captivity, are mistreated and kept in cages which are too small.“I think they’re happy, he says today.

although nine out of ten parents say they would be unhappy with schools reopening soon after lockdown is eased.When students do go back, there are likely to be some big changes inside classrooms.The Department for Education issued guidelines on May  on how schools should enforce social distancing - including limiting class sizes to  students.This is one of the measures now adopted in schools across Europe as they begin to reopen.Schools are told to stagger lunch and break times, as well as drop-off and pick-up times, to reduce the number of pupils moving around at once.It also said schools should look at bringing in a one-way system in corridors, or putting a ider in the middle to control the flow of kids.Ministers admitted they cannot keep kids two metres away from each other all day, so each class will form a self-contained bubble so they dont mix with other kids at the schools.Pupils have recently ed to schools in Wuhan, where coronavirus first took hold.Many of the schools that are now open in the area have restricted the number of pupils allowed into classrooms in order to ensure there can be adequate social distancing.This currently seems very unlikely.At the moment, its understood primary schools willfirst, followed by Year  and  pupils, who willto secondaries during a staggered recall.However, secondary schoolkids could join primary pupils andin just two weeks, the government said on Friday after a fiery row between ministers and unions.Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman says there is a “great deal of logic” in first moving younger kids back into the classroom first.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

and youngsters were taught how to practise social distancing.When youngstersin the UK, its likely similar measures will be followed.This isnt yet something the Government has offered specic guidance on.However, its a definite possibility.Adult Brits are going to be told theyll need to cover their faces in some workplaces and on public transport, and officials are stockpiling masks for the purpose.Countries around the world are largely insisting children wear masks.In France, secondary school children canto school in May - but onlythey wear a mask.The Government has so far issued very specic guidance about school meals on its website, although the issue has not yet been addressed for pupils ing to class.Under normal circumstances, schools are not expected to provide free school meals to eligible children who are not attending due to illness orthe school is closed.However, during the pandemic, schools are expected to continue providing support.Officials also say schools open for the vulnerable children, as well as key workers children, should provide meal options for staff and youngsters, as well as free schools meals for eligible pupils.Families in need can also apply for vouchers for major supermarkets through the gov.uk website.There was a suggestion in April that this was a possibility - but Ofsted chief Amanda Speilman has since claried its extraordinarily unlikely.Ms Speilman said that there will still be some children who will likely be schooled at homethey have family members who are vulnerable.She told Sky News Sophy Ridge show: Given that there will be substantial numbers of children in households where somebody is at high risk, I think it is extraordinarily unlikely that anybody would start at the stick end of the spectrum rather than the carrot.Matt Hancock had earlier refused to comment on whether those who decide not to send their children in may face fines."},{"url":null,"title":"first steps out of nightmare","story":"FINALLY some clarity after a day of chaos triggered by Boris Johnson’s Sunday night address. The Government cannot afford to repeat such a shambles.“Stay home, save lives” was a simple and effective message. The next steps are far more nuanced.They did not need another vague Churchillian rallying call. That merely sowed confusion, even among the PM’s deputy Dominic Raab and the staunchest Tories, and exposed Boris to a tsunami of snark on TV and social media.It needed instead the level of detail we eventually saw in the Government’s guidance released yesterday afternoon — and then in Boris’s Commons QA.Supporters claimed the PM’s new “stay alert” message was merely common sense any fool could grasp. That misses the point. We are being asked to live in highly unusual and restrictive ways. One person’s common sense is another’s idea of dangerous risk.Our circumstances are all dferent and specics are important — especially when police are to hand out increased fines for transgressions.But while the Government’s recent messaging has been poor, we at least now have our first welcome, albeit ­tentative, steps out of this nightmare:Outside exercise without limit, including the freedom to drive for a day out. The first chance in weeks to see a friend. All assuming social distancing.More solid guidance on masks. Precious little relief on schools, but the glimmer of some sport. Some, many Sun readers included, are being told toto work, though they may justiably fear it is unsafe.Their jobs also make them some of those most likely to die from Covid-.Their firms, factories and sites must bust a gut to ensure their safety, take every precaution and heed reasonable concerns. The grim reality, though, is that our economy must get moving again.It is typical of the infantile Left to complain that profits are being put before people. The Government is not a bottomless well of money. That’s why Rishi Sunak is limbering up to cut the sums paid to furloughed staff. He has to.Only a healthy economy and the taxes it generates can keep public services afloat, the NHS especially.Bankrupt Britain with an endless lockdown and you wreck those too. And far more lives are then lost.DONALD Trump is now harbouring an international fugitive.His case for refusing Britain’s request to extradite Harry Dunn’s alleged killer Anne Sacoolas is blown apart.The Interpol Red Notice, ordering her arrest outside the US, shows the “diplomatic immunity” under which she left the UK after the death crash was bogus.Even the US public want her to face the music.

All you need is a TV and the inclination.But while many will have used this virtual house arrest to shake off some unhealthy old habits , the reaction to Adele’s weight loss suggests that, for some, her transformation is a betrayal of everything fat activists hold dear.Of the , largely positive comments about the star losing an incredible seven stone, some sniped that she looked “unhealthy”and questioned how she lost it — the inference being that she had succumbed to having a gastric band.But as Pete Geracimo, her former personal trainer, points out: “It was never about getting super-skinny. It was about getting her healthy.”Not least, one suspects, for the benefit of her seven-year-old son Angelo. He adds: “She embraced better eating habits and committed to her fitness and ‘is sweating!’ I could not be prouder or happier for her.”Hear hear. Yet alarmingly, research out earlier this year found that millions of women hid their efforts to slim for fear of being mocked or labelled “anti-feminist”.Saints preserve us. The truth, of course, is thatsomeone is deeply insecure about their own weight, they either pooh-pooh or, worse, lash out at the efforts of those who manage to transform their lestyle via willpower and hard slog.Far easier to do that than take a look at our own bad habits and attempt to change them. True, there are plenty of people who look overweight but are physically fit.And there are plenty of skinny malinkies who can’t run for a bus without needing oxygen. At the end of the day, being happy within yourself is not about how you look, but how you feel.Andyou feel that you are unfit thanks to lousy eating habits and lack of exercise, then you should be able to do something about it without being taken to task by those who don’t have the same self-discipline.Particularly as last week’s research from the University of Liverpool found that obesity increased the risk of dying from coronavirus by  per cent. You can’t argue with that.BOREDOM at Moore Towers has reached such a crisis point that, on Sunday, I linked my iPhone to our portable speaker, put the songs on Shuffle and said we had to endure enjoy whatever track came up.At first there were plenty of goodies from Floyd, Bowie, Prefab Sprout and Talk Talk, but then Twinkle Twinkle Little Star popped up, followed by You Spin Me Round by . . . Alvin And The Chipmunks.For the record, our youngest is now . It seems it’s not just the kitchen cupboards that need a clear-out.BRINGING million people out of lockdown was never going to be easy.But Boris’s much-trumpeted grand statement was a damp squib that’s left us as confused as Adam and Eve on Mother’s Day.In a nutshell, four-year-olds will be able go to school with lots of kids they’re not related to but not see other kids in their family, we can go to work with colleagues but not have a chat with them in their garden, we can do unlimited exercise which we could have done anyway,we go abroad we have to self-isolate for a fortnight . . . unless it’s France, and you can drive to other destinations but not too far, whatever that means.As for “stay alert”, is that the same as Police  presenter Shaw Taylor’s old mantra of: “Keep ’em peeled ”Except we could actually see someone coming at us with a crowbar.A virus that can fit squillion times on to the head of a pin might prove harder to spot.GIVEN that the use of face masks is being actively encouraged but not the professional ones needed by key workers, a number of DIY versions are being suggested.Some involve an element of seamstress skills, but for those who want a quick and effective mask they can drum up with the minimum effort, this is my favourite.Loop a child’s hair tieover each end until it resembles a boiled sweet, then fold over the ends to meet in the middle .Then simply place the wrong side against your face, loop the hair ties around your ears, and voila.You’re welcome.FASHION designer Freya Edmondson – daughter of Ab Fab star Jenner Saunders and actor Ade Edmondson – has posted this photo of herself doing a “sumptuous, heart-opening backbend”, while writing on a notepad.Freya, who teaches free online yoga courses, is just  and, therefore, wonderfully flexible.As a former enthusiastic gymnast, it reminds me of my youth, when I would watch TV while doing the box splits – with my legs stretched out at right angles to my body.With my th birthday looming this Sunday,I attempted it now it would take four paramedics and a system of pulleys to get me on my feet again.ACADEMICS may lord it over the rest of us when it comes to quadratic equations, subatomic phenomena or the three components of the epidemiological triangle, but when it comes to common sense they are often found lacking.Quite how “Professor Lockdown” Neil Ferguson thought he could preach to the rest of us about social distancing while inviting his mistress to his house is anyone’s guess, but he did, and now he’s rightly had to resign for hypocrisynothing .He says: “I accept I made an error . . . I thought I was immune.”From Covid- . . . or criticism THE latest series of Killing Eve may have had a lukewarm reception from critics, but central character Villanelle’s fashion choices have been attracting a lot of attention.One frock cost £,, another £,, and her red leather catsuit would set you back an eye-watering £,.I know these are desperate times for all businesses, but since when have fashionistas been clamouring to get their clothes on the back of a psychotic murderer It gives a whole new meaning to “dressed to kill”.HAIRDRESSERS are to stay closed until July  at the earliest.Up to now I have been making do with the occasional fringe cut using a pair of nail scissors.But given that my “style”is supposed to be choppy bob, and I now resemble Richard lll, it seems I will have to tackle the rest of it too.Worse, The Bloke will have to do the back and, God forbid, baldlygo where no man has gone before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I’ll admit, I didn’t correct the ­lawyer .But there’s a darker side to it. A generation of young city dwellers who know nothing about Britain were always bound to underestimate our four great nations.And so they did in the  referendum.The overlap between London and the Remain campaign has been well documented —  per cent of the capital voted in favour of remaining in the EU.Among London’s student population, the depth of ­support for the EU was overwhelming.And with some ultra-liberal friends, there were moments when it would have seemed easier to come out as a ­paedophile than a Brexiteer.Of course, ardent young Remainers convinced themselves that their love of the European Union was borne out of a sophisticated appreciation of all things global.But it seems more likely to me that they saw the EU as the ­saviour to a backwards, grisly country they imagined in their ignorance to be Britain.This summer, that ignorance could finally be shattered.Thanks to Covid-, the nation’s young people won’t have the option of scurrying to ­Heathrow the second their uni exams are over.Instead —they want holidays at all — they’ll be minibreaking in Manchester or camping in the English countryside.Yes, they might turn their noses up at rolling hills, stunning architecture and incredible free museums.But I have a sneaking suspicion they’ll be surprised and impressed with what they find beyond the confines of the M.And, reconnected to their roots at last, they might just begin to feel the first stirrings of patriotism running through their British veins.When the Government published its new guidelines for lockdown in England, I – like the rest of Twitter – found myself getting very worked up about whether or not I’m allowed to play tennis with someone outside of my household.The problem, as my mum gently reminded me, is that in my case it’s a bit of a moot point: I’ve never played tennis before and I’m not entirely sure how to hold a racket.I doubt either my housemate or my friends will be begging for a game any time soon.IT’S not often I find myself welling up at the radio. But LBC caller Liz, from Witham, Essex, got me in the gut this week.Through uncontrollable tears, she explained thatcoronavirus didn’t kill her, being forbidden from touching her grand-children surely would.She’s not alone. After nearly two gruelling months of lockdown, millions of us are experiencing real, gut-wrenching loneliness.They don’t like to complain – they know their suffering is dwarfed by that of frontline health and care staffers. But starved of the company of those they love, they are withering like plants out of sunshine.You’d expect a Conservative government instinctively to get this. For generations, Tory MPs have told us that family is crucially important to the ing of the UK.They’ve thrown their weight behind policies designed to strengthen families and made many moving speeches about how a family unit is more than the sum of its parts.But it seems all that was just for show. For in their admirable haste to propel Brits back to work, this Government seems to have forgotten about families altogether.Boris Johnson’s Sunday night speech – stuffed full of specic advice for workers – didn’t have a single word of hope for single adult relatives craving each other’s company.And the millions of young adults longing to know when they can next hug Mum will have been bitterly disappointed.Of course, the PM is right to say we need to get the economy going again.Forecasts from the Treasury on the upcoming recession could hardly be more alarming – and despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, millions of businesses will go bustthey can’t get up and running again soon.Butwe’re expected to get up close with colleagues for the sake of the economy, surely we should get to see those we love best for the sake of our mental health The people of Britain are humans, not cash cows. Andthey are to get through this long, draining war in one piece, they need the support of the people they love.LISTENING to BBC News anchor Fiona Bruce casually describe carers as “low-skilled workers” really set my teeth on edge.To the shame of this nation, care home staff are indeed low paid.But low skilled  I reckon plenty of them would be more than capable of reading the news from an autocue for £, a year.And I’d like to see cofed Fiona feed, clean and comfort a newly widowed dementia sufferer without losing her cool.FOR the best part of the past decade, bespectacled “experts” gravely predicted that online dating would kill romance.Apps – they told us – would transform the dating scene into an endless virtual marketplace where singles could shop for each other , or  would turn dating into a minimal-effort pursuit of on-demand hook ups .How wrong they were.Rather than bonking their way round new digital acquaintances, millennial Brits in the st Century spend their downtime uploading photos and biographies to their smartphones and earnestly looking for love.And my, do they succeed.Last year a whopping  per cent of newly married couples met online, and Hinge – the dating app geared towards lelong relationships – is gaining users faster than any of its competitors.Granted, these apps aren’t perfect.We all like a good romance story, and Dad messaging Mum with a winky face because he liked her bikini selfie is hardly the stuff of Hollywood.But now that flirting in the pub is a thing of the past, let’s thank our lucky stars that the country’s poor singles have a shot at love at all.Rather than sitting on the sofa twiddling their thumbs, furloughed folk have been busy sculpting, chiselling and painting – and selling the fruits of their labours online.These plucky, small-time entrepreneurs are the very best of Britain.And with them around, I have no doubt this country will be back on its feet in no time.I’M absolutely loving Normal People on BBC.The chemistry between Marianneand Connellis really quite something.And as an ode to young love, the whole thing is pitch-perfect.In fact, my only quibble is why on earth are all the characters so darn sophisticated They’re , for goodness sake.Let’s see fewer candle-lit, red wine-soaked dinner parties and more tins of warm Foster’s. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Teachers know this.There are some who would like to delay the opening of schools - there is a consequence to this.But teaching unions have also received the backing of the doctors union, the British Medical Association, who said unions were absolutely right to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening schools on June .The news comes as the UKs coronavirus death toll rose to ,  after  further deaths were recorded in the last  hours.A total of , people have now tested positive for Covid- across Britain - up , cases from yesterday. The latest rise in deaths confirmed by the Department of Health is bigger than it was yesterday, when  more deaths were logged.Figures also show that  - or almost half - of the deaths happened outside hospital.The figures are an increase from last Saturdays .To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think parents and teachers should not be thinking that every school is swarming with cases, we are moving in quite a dferent direction now.Dr Harries said the idea is to have little groups in the classroom where you increase the level of interaction a small amount, but it is contained.Social interactions among older children is more likely to affect the R value than simply going back to school, deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries said.Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefing, she said: The model thats been adopted, the suggestion for younger children to go back to school, is not just because of the school environment but its about the behaviours that go with it.If you pull back a whole load of older children, they tend to get on buses, travel longer distances, have dferent social interactions.And some of those social interactions are actually far more signicant in moving the R value than just going back to school.Unions are opposed to the plan and have warned classes may not resume until September.They have asked the government to urgently publish the scientic evidence behind the decision to reopen Englands schools to more pupils from June .A survey for the Office for National Statistics of , people has found no evidence of dferences between age groups in those who tested positive.The number of those testing positive for coronavirus is between . and . per cent across all ages.Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology of the University of Reading, who was not part of the ONS project, said: We have a horrible choice ahead of us with reopening schools.Back when we first started learning about this virus, we knew from China that children did not seem to be so affected. That leads to two questions. The first is whether they get the virus. And now we know that yes, they do. The second is whether they transmit it. We dont know the answer to that.Last month a study by the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health, found children do not play a signicant role in spreading the deadly virus.They said the evidence consistently demonstrates reduced infection and infectivity of children in the transmission chain.And there has not been a single case of a child under  passing on coronavirus in contact tracing carried out by the World Health Organisation.However there are reports some kids suffer a rare inflammatory syndrome weeks after being infected with Covid-.In a very small number of children it can cause serious complications, with some needing intensive care.Up to  children in the UK have been affected and studies suggest the same reaction is being seen in kids where in Europe.It is likely to be caused by a delayed immune response to the virus which looks like Kawasaki disease.Council leaders have said schools should be allowed to make their owns decisions about reopening - especially in areas where there is a higher proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic residents.That comes after analysis by the Office for National Statistics suggested black men and women are more than four times more likely to die from coronavirus than white people.The government has faced increasing pressure from union leaders and MPs to release the science behind its plans to get kids back in schools.Osama Rahman, chief scientic adviser at the Department for Education, said there was a low degree of confidence in evidence suggesting children transmit Covid- less than adults.Former Labour education secretary Lord Blunkett yesterday said he was surprised by union leaders attitude towards reopening schools.He said: I am being deeply critical of the attitude. Its about how can we work together to make it work as safely as possible. Anyone who works against that in my view is working against the interests of children.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: When you have medical and scientic advice that is saying its the right time to start bringing schools back in a phased and controlled manner, it seems only the right thing to do and the only responsible thing to do.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Schools will also have to increase measures to make sure surfaces and items which children and adults touch are clean. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here   Dr Harries told the Downing Street daily briefing: The basic public health principle is you want to keep everything as clean as possible - touch pointsyou like, so the things we normally think of as door handles and those sorts of things, wipe down and clean frequently. I think the thing in a childrenaposs environment is there are certain things that you can control pretty well, which might include pencil cases and things that you use routinely during education, and by doing that, schools can provide them and ensure that they are maintained clean.  The issue about lunch boxes is theyaposre quite personal to the child eating the lunch, and I can almost guarantee that one child wonapost want to eat the lunch of the one sitting hopefully two metres distance from them. Responding to a question from the Sunday Mirroraposs Nigel Nelson, she continued: And actually when youaposre eating youaposre also putting your hands up to your mouth and to your face so there is a dferential there around risk both on what iniduals need and what the school can supply and on managing the hygiene around it.  She added hygiene was important for both lunchboxes and pencil cases, and stressed the need to encourage children to wash their hands before and after eating. The Government expects children to be able toto nurseries and childcare settings, and for reception, year one and year six pupils to be back in school, from June  at the earliest. She said: Although it is recognised that small children will run around and interact, we expect them to, but you can still distance. I know this is the plan.  She also suggested that desks could be placed appropriate distances apart from one another to prevent long periods of close contact. Dr Harries added: A child rushing past another one in a normal area is probably not much of a risk. Butthey were sitting directly opposite to each other in a very small space, close together for a long amount of time - that might be more of a risk.  All of the interventions are designed to minimise those, while still allowing children to learn.From next month, Mr Williamson said, children will qualy for coronavirus testingthey show symptoms.A track-and-trace system will be introduced to prevent the killer bug spreading as a result of schools reopening, he told the daily Downing Street briefing this afternoon.

The Prime Minister may have survived Covid-, but the British people will not forgive him for the way the disease has engulfed the nation. In an exclusive Sunday Mirror poll today,  per cent of voters blame the Government for the highest death toll in Europe, and one in three of those cites the PM’s poor leadership. When specic health advice is called for, he rambles. When a straight answer is needed, he blusters. We get confusion when clarity is most required. Mr Johnson has shed some pounds since his illness and as PM he is now being exposed for the lightweight he is. A cheeky smile and a ready joke are no substitute for the competent leadership Britain needs at a time of peril like no other since the Second World War. The grotesque chaos in our care homes has left at least , dead. Health Secretary Matt Hancock must shoulder responsibility for the failure to test and the lack of PPE which caused that. When the care sector desperately needs money just to survive, it is not getting through. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick is responsible for that. First Secretary Dominic Raab and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps are bargain-basement barrow boys, Home Secretary Priti Patel is merely second-rate and only Rishi Sunak has emerged with any sign of sure feet.  No wonder the Chancellor is being talked up as Boris Johnson’s replacement. Because it is with the PM that the buck stops. We now know that he ordered lockdown too late, and unease is growing that he is lting it too early. Only one in five of those questioned in our poll thinks it safe for children toto school next month. And it is telling that the UK is no longer united as the devolved administrations choose to move at dferent speeds. That shows how confidence in our leader is ebbing away. We accept that dealing with a novel virus would test any government. We appreciate that Mr Johnson has probably not fully recovered from his own brush with death. But when thousands of lives depend on his decisions, what we get is not good enough. We endure minister after minister telling us at the daily No update how clever they are.

That yielded a  per cent increase in Army recruits while recruitment for the Army reserve was up  per cent. The cost of the campaign was uncovered by the Sunday Mirror. Retired colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, said: “It seems there has been an improvement in recruitment. The Army is extremely small and it needs every billet manned.

For the last two months, Natalie and four other volunteers have been forced to survive almost without any aid in one of the worldaposs most remote locations. Natalie and her fellow volunteers were due to be rescued on May  but were left devastated again when their boat was cancelled after Thailand extended its lockdown. The scuba er instructor, who should be back in Devon by now and working as a summer school teacher, is hopeful another boat will arrive to collect them later this month. However, her visa has expired and no new ones are being issued while the coronavirus pandemic holds the world in its grip. Natalie said: The hardest thing for me has been not knowing how long weaposre going to be here. Itaposs kind of up and down, weaposre a very small group of people and weaposre living in a very confined, close situation. In the back of our minds is obviously families back home and stuff, which adds to the tension a little bit. Weaposre just trying to take things day by day. But for now, the tiny group have had to do what they can to survive, using washed up bits of plastic to make their rainforest camp. They share the island with scorpions, snakes, mouse-deer, wild boar, monitor lizards, and slow lorises, and have to forage for most of their food, including yams, jackfruit and other vegetation. There have been sporadic deliveries by boat of food staples, including rice and pasta. But the group are conscious they have to make sure these last as they donapost know when the next one will arrive - and there have been plenty of days where they have gone hungry. Natalie said: We have to be very aware of how much we consume, we are eating very basic food and really having to make it last. Despite the desperate situation the group, which is made up of two women and three men from England, Hungary, Canada, Malaysia and France, find themselves in - they are not totally alone. There is one resort on Kyun Pila, Awei Pila, which is a  minute dinghy sail away and where they can access water, showers and accomodation on portable cabins, as well as a patchy wi signal. This has proved a leline for Natalie, who is concerned for her -year-old father, who lives in Poole in the UK. But the group, who are volunteers with environmental group Ocean Quest Global, have had to adapt quickly to spending so much extra time on the island. Their jungle camp has been constructed from washed up plastic, with each person living in a hut made from bamboo, rice sacks and bottles. They have even managed to erect furniture in their new Robinson Crusoe-inspired le, have dug a well, a fire pit and place to wash.The volunteers have also started planting their own vegetables. There are other challenges for the small group, existing in such extreme circumstances. Natalie explained: Usually in a programme like this there is a regular change of volunteers, which keeps things fresh and interesting, but the other three volunteers have been with each other a long time now and relationships are strained at times. Communal living is always a challenge because you get so little personal space and have to compromise a great deal. One person’s negative attitude or bad mood will affect everyone. The group has been forced to adapt to their change in circumstances, with people learning to hack jungle trails, drive a dingy and build with bamboo. Natalie has earned herself the nickname Trash Squirrel by spending her days combing the beach for washed up waste that can then be put to use to build the structures theyaposre calling home and to be turned into useful tools for surivival. But as spring slowly turns into summer Natalie and her fellow volunteers are facing a new challenge - the tropical rainy season. Already the clouds are coming in faster and the first few drops of rain have started to fall. They are working to do all they can to ensure they are as ready as possible for when the downpours do come.  However, Natalie is still hopeful that a rescue boat will come for them before the rainy season begins in earnest. She says it has also been a useful time for getting to know herself better. Natalie explained: I learned that no matter how Zen and chilled I had thought I was, in moments of solitude and dficult moments of physical and mental tiredness, I still lose control and stop being mindful and calm. That no matter how friendly and cheerful I usually am, when I am locked down on a relatively small island with strangers, I become moody, grumpy and little motivated.

And three quarters of those say it should be permanent. A Sunday Mirror poll by Redfield  Wilton Strategies found  per cent of those questioned say our healthcare heroes deserve the increase.Nearly three quarters of Britain’s voters say the country could have avoided having the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe. And  per cent of those say Boris Johnson ’s poor leadership is to blame for the disease’s spread, although an overall  per cent think there was a collective failure by MPs, ministers, officials and scientic advisers.The top three reasons people gave for the , deaths at care homes were the lack of personal protective equipment, too little testing, and not locking down the UK early enough. Plans to open schools to some children next month are unpopular, with only one in five believing it is safe. More than half think lockdown is being lted too quickly and  per cent say Boris Johnson added to confusion over the new rules. Nearly one in four would be very nervous about ing to normal activities next month, and fewer than one in three of us would be confident doing so by September. Half of Brits won’t be happy to resume their usual activities until newly confirmed coronavirus cases fall below  a day.  Nearly three quarters want the law changed so bosses have to give staff the option to work from home once lockdown lts. And more than three quarters would like to see videolink consultations with GPs continue.  While  per cent say masks should be compulsory on public transport, more than eight in  reckon workers should be encouraged to walk, cycle or drive to avoid buses and trains.The Queen and Rishi Sunak have improved their reputations with their responses to the pandemic."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus could see package holiday","story":"NewsCoronavirus could see package holiday prices double due to social distancing on planesEXCLUSIVE Breaks could rise by as much as £ a person on average, its claimed, as the travel industry struggles to deal with the consequences of the pandemicShareCommentsByStephen Hayward:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video grant-shapps-reacts-uk-economy-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-could-see-package-holiday-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The award-winning documentary-maker was given access to the top-security Porton Down laboratory where vaccines from two of our top universities are being tested. Michael told the Sunday Mirror: “Everybody is moving ahead with the belief we’ll have a vaccine by the end of the year. The speed at which it’s happening is astonishing as vaccines normally take five to  years.” Michael, , met Miles Carroll, deputy director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, at the sprawling base in Salisbury, Wilts, for a BBC Horizon special. Researchers there are looking at vaccines produced by Oxford University and Imperial College London. A million doses of Oxford’s vaccine could be ready as early as September.  Around , people will take part in its trial, half receiving the vaccine and the other half receiving a meningitis vaccine, and results are expected to begin to emerge next month.AstraZeneca, the Cambridge-based pharmaceutical group, is teaming up with Oxford University to manufacture and distribute the vaccineclinical trials are positive. Michael, who created the : diet, said: “Our own scientists are storming ahead. It’s brilliant. They got the funding and the scientists were there to rock and roll.  “The Americans and Chinese are amongst the leaders but British vaccine leaders are at the forefront. One scientist I spoke to this week was confident at least one vaccine will be available this year.” Scientists at the centre also trialled the Roche antibody tests, which they judged to be % accurate. That is now being rolled out across the country and is seen as key to getting the nation back to work. Michael said: “Porton Down is one of the few places you can test these things.  They have the live virus down there. It’s odd when you see them in their hoods and protective clothing. “The thing that’s causing all these problems is right there. They’re manipulating it and testing it right in front of you. It’s strange being so close to something which is causing distress around the planet.” Michael was last at the site in  for a BBC show. He said: “Back then they were talking about the risk of a pandemic exactly like this one. People have been worrying about it for years.”  Michael said authorities were caught out by the pandemic after previous outbreaks such as SARS and MERS were contained in Asia and the Middle East and did not affect the UK. “People got complacent,” he said. “So when Covid happened we were ill-prepared.” And he fears there are more outbreaks ahead, adding: “The rate these viruses are emerging is accelerating. There’s no doubt in my mind there are others coming down the track. Hopefully lessons have been learnt and we’ll be better prepared for next time.” But other scientists say a vaccine is unlikely to be available for general use before .  Business Secretary Alok Sharma is spending £million to speed up the building of a vaccine manufacturing centre on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire. But he will say today that although it will come on stream a year earlier than planned, it will not open until next summer. Any vaccine will take at least six months to produce after that. There are  research projects worldwide using £million of UK funding. Eight are now using people for clinical tests. But most experts predict vaccine discovery to be a year to  months away.

Currently, the NHS say a persistent cough and a fever are the two main Covid- symptons. However, people diagnosed with the virus have complained of other symptoms, with a loss of speech a possible sign of the disease. Experts at the World Health Organisationsaid dficulty speaking could be accompanied by a lack of movement, and anyone experiencing these symptoms should see a doctor. The WHO said: Most people infected with the COVID- virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Serious symptoms: Dficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, loss of speech or movement. Seek immediate medical attentionyou have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility. But, a loss of speech may not necessarily always be a sign of coronavirus. Speaking dficulties could also be a sign of other medical or psychological conditions, such as hearing loss, hearing problems, certain toxins, or selective mutism. Earlier this week, a new study highlighted another, lesser-known symptom - psychosis.  Researchers at Orygen and La Trobe University in Melbourne have warned that coronavirus is causing psychotic episodes for some patients. Dr  Ellie Brown, co-lead author of the study, said: “COVID- is a very stressful experience for everyone, particularly those with complex mental health needs.“We know that psychosis, and first episodes of psychosis, are commonly triggered by substantial psychosocial stresses. In the context of COVID-, this could include stress relating to isolation and having to potentially remain within challenging family situations.” In the study, the team looked at research on viruses such as MERS as SARS, to examinethere was a connection on how these viruses might impact people with psychosis. The results suggest that some coronavirus patients may experience psychotic symptoms, such as hearing voices. Professor Richard Gray, co-lead author of the study, said: “Maintaining infection control procedures when people are psychotic is challenging. “In order for them not to become potential transmitters of the virus, clinicians and service providers may benefit from specic infection control advice to mitigate any transmission risk.” While mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety are already being focused on amid the pandemic, the researchers hope their findings will spark further research into more severe mental health conditions like psychosis. Professor Gray added: “This is a group thataposs probably going to need more support, with isolation, physical distancing, hand washing etc, and clinicians may be the ones who need to be thinking and working on this to assist this vulnerable population.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailFor more than  years the ­family of murdered Susan Rushworth have pleaded with one of Britain’s most chilling killers to end their living hell. But evil Stephen Grfiths, who shot his prostitute victims with a crossbow before chopping them up and eating their flesh, still won’t tell them where her remains are. Susan’s killing not only plunged her family into unimaginable grief, it sent her vulnerable daughter Kirsty spiralling into prostitution and drugs as she struggled to cope with the loss of her mum. This week – a decade on from the Crossbow Cannibal killings that shocked the nation – her son James told how the anniversary had rekindled all their ­despair at not knowing where Susan is, and how they have given up hope Grfiths will tell them. “The police have told us to write to him and ask him where mum’s body is – but it’s not going to happen is it  It’s a joke, isn’t it. He won’t do the decent thing,” said James, .  And his -year-old gran Christine fears she will go to her grave never knowing where her daughter lies. Mum-of-three Susan, , was the first of uni student Grfiths’ three known victims. The killing spree at his seedy flat on the edge of Bradford’s red-light district made headlines worldwide. He later confessed to police he took apart his victims’ bodies with a hunting kne in the bath after shooting them with his crossbow. He ate some of their flesh before dumping the remains. Susan was last seen getting off a bus in June . Detectives later found traces of her blood in the flat. In April , Grfiths – who was completing a PhD in homicide studies at the city’s university – struck a second time. He shot Shelley Armitage, , another sex worker, and dismembered her – even filming his crime on his phone while commentating on it. He then used public transport to move her body parts in bin bags so he could dispose of them. In May  he killed his final victim, Suzanne Blamires, , who he kidnapped and held in his flat for two days before she made a desperate attempt to escape. Chilling CCTV footage in the corridor outside his flat showed him executing the prostitute with a crossbow bolt. Then he brazenly strolled up to the camera and made a one-fingered gesture. Police were alerted after a horried caretaker viewed the footage. When they arrived at his flat, he was calmly waiting to be taken into custody. He told officers he had eaten parts of his victims, declaring he “didn’t have much time for the human race”. Grfiths, then , said he had killed “loads of women” and even compared himself to Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutclfe who murdered . Body parts found in the River Aire, in Shipley, near Bradford, were identied as Suzanne’s.  Other human tissue found in the same river was later established as belonging to Shelley. But no remains of Susan have ever been found. Her distraught daughter Kirsty has revealed she sent a letter to the killer asking where her mum was so she could have a proper funeral – but never got a reply. In a cruel twist, she found herself sucked into the world of prostitution and drugs, haunted by loss of her mother. Several years after the murder Kirsty, now , described herself as Grfiths’ “fourth victim” as she worked the same street corners as her mum to feed her habit. But now her protective big brother James says she had thankfully turned her le around and is doing well. He said: “It’s all sorted. She’s all right. She’s with us.” James said his gran Christine couldn’t face talking about the loss of her daughter again.But she also has previously pleaded with Grfiths to tell her what he did with Susan’s body. She said: “She is with me every day in my heart but I will not have peace until I can bury Susan and visit her grave. “I just wish Grfiths would tell me or the police where she is. I don’t know why he won’t. “Perhaps he feels that he retains some power over us. And he does because I want to go and put flowers on Susan’s resting place and only he can grant me that wish.” Christine said her daughter, a former grammar school pupil, slid into the seedy world of drugs and vice after a brain haemorrhage that brought on epilepsy. “Susan was trying to turn her le around and was doing really well and was getting off the drugs and staying with me. “The day she went ­missing she said she was going out to get some medicine and would be back soon, but she never came home.” "},{"url":null,"title":"great big parenting survey tell","story":"NewsGreat Big Parenting survey: Tell us what le is like in lockdown for your familyCalling all parents.

Mr Howarth, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was given just two months to live on Easter Sunday in April after he was found to have a lymphoma and tumours in his liver, kidneys and brain.Mrs Howarth told the Manchester Evening News: I’ve been finding it quite hard but my kids have got me through. I have to keep going for them. to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email. My eldest is up and down, sometimes he says he misses his daddy. The youngest doesn’t know too much of what’s going on but he just knows that daddy’s in heaven now. The Howarths had a three-year-old son, Lucian, and Mr Howarth was stepdad to his weaposs older son, Bryce, who is seven. After the shock diagnosis, Mr Howarthaposs condition took a turn for the worse on April  and the couple got married in their front room that evening. The dad died less than  hours later.  Mrs Howarthaposs mum, Sandra Whittaker, said: They were a really special couple. Gavin was a great man, smiling all the time - he had a heart of gold. He was a great dad, boyfriend and husband and a fantastic stepdad to Bryce - he knew his favourite superhero was Superman, so he went to pick him up from school one time all dressed up and took him to McDonaldaposs. That’s the kind of person he was. The pair had discussed tying the knot before the diagnosis. But they were waiting to make sure they had enough money for a dream wedding. Mr Howarth was diagnosed after he suffered shortness of breath and severe back pain for weeks. It was thought that his symptoms were due to asthma and lting involved in his work as a carpet fitter. The pain became so bad that he left his job and started working at a fish and chip shop last October.  He saw a GP in March and he underwent tests to determine whether he had tuberculosis, a bacterial infection he had as a child and resulted in one of his lungs being removed. Doctors discovered a lymphoma and tumours in his liver, kidneys and brain. After being given the terminal diagnosis, the couple decided to get married on May  in the garden of their home in Kirkholt. However, the pair had to get married inside their home due to Mr Howarthaposs worsening condition. Friends, neighbours and businesses had donated items for an outdoor ceremony and reception.  Ms Whittaker said: I had a group of about  or  friends who I thought could help and asked them to spread the word. We were just overwhelmed by what people gave us - some gave us some white drapes or some articial flowers to make the place look beautul, people offered us a balloon arch and some pretty white fairy lights. “My brother-in-law, James Oldham, spent three days doing up the garden, cleaning up all the stone work, planting flowers and making it nice for them. Even though it didn’t end up happening in the garden, we still had people offering to come and do hair and make up and other nice things.” One Shop Weddings donated £, worth of wedding supplies and Morrisons gave party food for the reception.  Ms Whittaker added: Some people have donated money, people they don’t even know. I had no idea people could be so lovely - we only asked for a few items but to think of what we got, I just can’t say thank you enough. Mrs Howarth was told to bring the wedding forward after a visit from nurses.Two registrars came to their home that evening despite the coronavirus lockdown and the couple was married at pm with their two boys, Ms Whittaker, Mr Howarthaposs mum Mandy present.Mr Howarthaposs brother Lee and sister Gina, and Mrs Howarthaposs dad Karl watched from the garden.

She said: “He was there for ages. Police were doing patrols and they saw this suspicious guy and approached him “Apparently when they approached him he put what looked like wire snippers in his bag and took off. “There were lots of cars trying to chase him but he went down the university and cars can’t go down there. “The police did try and chase him, two officers rang to say they were sorry they didn’t catch him. “I just had to walk home and cry, and I’m still walking in. It’s a nightmare. Lily is now appealing for anyone who sees the bike, or sees it being sold, to get in touch with the police. She said: “It wasn’t so much the bike, it’s the principle of it. They would have known it was an NHS worker’s bike. It’s just beyond me why they would do that. “I’m still hoping I might get it back. My mum says I’m being optimistic, but I am quite an optimistic person.” Northumbria Police’s Neighbourhood Inspector for Newcastle city centre, Karen Madge, said: “At .pm on Monday we received a report that a bicycle had been stolen from the site of the RVI in Newcastle. Officers attended the area but the suspect had already fled the scene, it later emerged that the bicycle belonged to a nurse at the hospital. We are carrying out extensive enquiries to identy the bicycle and locate the offender. That includes the review of CCTV cameras in the area and high visible patrols around the area of the hospital.

Drinkers at the The Betsey Wynne in Swanbourne, Buckinghamshire, will enter and leave through a one-way system and be seated at tables two metres apart that are separated by Perspex screens. Customers will be urged to keep their hands clean with gel dispensers visually displayed throughout the premises and they will use disposable menus to place their order using a phone app. The pub would have a limit of  customers but the premises is spacious and also has a big beer garden. Peter Borg-Neal, CEO of Oakman Inns which owns the pub said is being used as a prototype to demonstrate how the scheme could offer pubs a leline. He told The Sun: “The country is desperate for a proper pint in the pub and we are asking the Government to treat us like grown-ups and let us open. “We strongly believe in this idea and are presenting it to the Cabinet Office via our trade body, UK Hospitality. A government adviser is reportedly supportive of the measures and brewery chiefs say it can be in place three weeks after getting the green light. The innovative plan comes hospitality bosses have warned that around , pubs may have to close their doors permanentlythey are among the last businesses to be allowed to reopen by the government. Boris Johnson previously announced the hospitality sector - including pubs and bars - must remain closed until at least July. The British Beer  Pub Associationhas warned that up  per cent of Britainaposs pubs cannot survive beyond September with the current level of financial support being offered by the Government. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the BBPA, said despite looking for a glimmer of hope, the industry now faced further weeks of uncertainty. With insufficient clarity as to when pubs will reopen, our sector remains in limbo and facing severe uncertainty and financial devastation, she said. Mr Borg-Neal echoed her claims adding that pubs need to reopen to get the economy aposgoing againapos.  He said when the lockdown was announced  barrelsfrom The Betsey had to be ed to the brewery. He added: “I can get on a Tube train with a load of strangers but I can’t go and have a pint in the pub with a mate. Where is the logic ” Government adviser Professor Robert Dingwall said: “If it is a sunny weekend and the pub has a garden and the landlords are prepared to accept responsibility for not overcrowding it, I see no particular reason why it should not reopen.” Mr Borg-Neal added: “We’d need three weeks’ notice to get in deliveries so evenwe got the all-clear on Monday we wouldn’t open until next month.

The retired business consultant has masses of round ones. But there are also square ones, oval ones and expensive ones picked up on his travels. The designs tell a story of beer-making through the decades. Some rare finds are from as far afield as the US, New Zealand and Australia. Richard, , has spent almost  years hoarding more than , of the pub mementos. And he has no plans to call “time please, gents” on his unusual interest. He says: “At first my family thought I was stark raving mad and were embarrassed when I used to ask publicans for spare trays. “I’d start with the words ‘I have an unusual hobby’. You could feel them cringe. But my collection is British history and that’s why people want to see it. “It is unique. Many of the breweries no longer exist.” Richard got hooked while on a footie trip with a beer mat-collecting pal back in .  He recalls: “I didn’t pay anything for my first tray. I’m a Notts County supporter and in  I was on an away trip to Brighton. “A fellow fan collected beer mats and asked a landlord for a specic mat. “The landlord only had a tray so I took it and that’s where it all started.”  It took we Susan, a -year-old retired solicitor, time to accept his unusual interest. Richard adds: “These days my family accepts my passion is preserving brewery history and my we even encouraged a few items to be displayed in the kitchen. Susan does appreciate it represents brewing history. “She’s happy about my display room and lets me have items in my office. But beyond that I’m banned from discussing it.”  Son Tim, , is on board too and Richard says: “He thinks I’m nuts but he always keeps an eye out for me when he’s out drinking”. Richard has two pints of ale most nights and loves Fullers ESB, Bathams and Elgood’s Black Dog Mild. He’ll open a fresh cask when pals visit. “My friends continue to take the mickey but deep down they’re impressed,” he says.  Richard, from Rutland, spends up to £ a time on trays, many sourced from the internet. But, just like his first, landlords often give them away. His oldest example, a small oval copper item from the Lyde Green Brewery in Cradley, West Mids, dates from the s. And his favourite is an oval tray from Warwicks  Richardsons brewery in Newark, Notts.

The home may look teeny from the outside but step inside the front door and this unassuming home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, hides an incredible secret. The cottage was the home of artist Antony Dracup, who spent years transforming it from a traditional terrace into something far more interesting. It boasts two bedrooms, a living room and a galley kitchen, perfect for family cooking. But walk further into the home and youaposll come to a massive sandstone cave, which comes complete with vaulted celings, ornate pillars and tile mosaics. And Antony didnapost stop there, he also created stunning landscaped gardens, a roof terrace, an attic room and a bathroom. Not only that but the determined artist completed many of his cave excavations by hand. His son, Dennis, explained: Every house that he took up residence in received the Dracup treatment – arches, pillars, balustrades, moulding, marbling, graining, nishing, stained-glass all designed and crafted from start to finish by his hand. In true Colditz style – a little every day, but persistently – he chiselled away. His persistence was rewarded with noticeably stronger chest muscles and extra living space.Antony died in  when he was  but he used the sandstone caves that are common in the area he lived in in Shropshire for his inspiration for the incredible adjustments to his home. The caves had previously been used as a place for young people to socialise but now form part of this unusual home. After moving into the home in the s, Antony worked tirelessly to transform it. The huge cave structure now makes up half the size of the property and he also levelled parts of the home to create ever bigger living spaces.But his first job was to sound-proof his house using an extra layer of bricks before he set about chiseling away at the cave that was originally in part of the garden. His son says on a website dedicated to his fatheraposs work: By way of a ladder it was possible to access the four levels of terracing, oddly and asymmetrically designed so as to fully involve the climber in the experience -you darenapost put a foot wrong here. Cast concrete, decorative features and moulding shared the daylight with lettuce, tomatoes an apple tree and much other edible produce. A vertical kitchen-garden which, to my fatheraposs delight, was once mistaken for a Roman Ruin in a local aerial survey.  Following Antonyaposs death all the subsequent owners have stayed true to his vision, keeping his stunning cave and all the intricate touches he had added. And when the property was last put on the market in  it had an asking price of just under £,.

But commuters have been warned that capacity will be hugely reduced due to social distancing rules and they should avoid travelling during peak times in the morning and afternoon. TfL has identied the busiest places on its Tube and rail network. Scroll down for a list.Passengers have been asked to wear a face covering, respect the space of fellow commuters and not to travelthey have any symptoms of coronavirus.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening. In its latest travel advice, which echoes previous warnings, TfL said by next week it plans to increase service levels to around  per cent on the bus network, and  per cent on the Tube and London Overground to be in line with National Rail services. A full service will be operating on TfL Rail and service levels will be raised to  per cent on the DLR which operates mostly in east London. In an email to customers, a TfL managing director, Vernon Everitt, wrote: However, given the national requirement to maintain  metres distance between passengers wherever possible, the capacity on all services will be hugely reduced. On the Tube, for example, capacity will only be around - per cent of normal even once services are back to full strength. This means transport must operate very dferently. He added: In line with Government advice, everyone who can work from home should continue to do so. Public transport should be avoided, wherever possible, to free up the limited space available to those who have no alternative way to travel.  TfL said many of its staff are themselves ill, shielding or self-isolating. Commuters have been told to travel outside of the busiest times, especially first thing in the morning between .am and .am and between pm and .pm. They are encouraged to take the most direct route and avoid busy interchanges. These stations and lines should be avoided: - Central line between South Woodford Redbridge and Stratford - Jubilee line between Stratford and Westminster - District line between Dagenham Heathway and Aldgate East - Victoria line - London Overground between Stratford and Willesden Junction - DLR between Woolwich Arsenal and Canning Town  Passengers may be asked to wait to enter a station. Some stations are using one-way systems. For those travelling by bus, they must board using the middle doors. Like the Government, TfL is urging people to consider walking or cycling instead during all or part of their journey. Passengers are being asked to: - Wear a face covering - Keep two metres apart from others where possible - Wash their hands before and after your journey - Carry a hand sanitiser or use sanitiser points installed in stations - Use contactless or Oyster cards to pay for travel - Follow Government and TfL advice - Be considerate to staff From the coronavirus to Brexit, this is an era of great change and uncertainty.

Most health experts believe it will take  to  months or more to get a vaccine ready for the public. However Dr Slaoui, who will be the teamaposs chief scientist, claims he is confident that millions of vaccines can be delivered by the end of the year. I have very recently seen early data from a clinical trial with a coronavirus vaccine, he said. And these data made me feel even more confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of . Trump then played down the importance of a vaccine. Vaccine or no vaccine, weaposre back, he added. Weaposve got countries that are allies ... we have some countries, frankly, that arenapost allies where weaposre working very closely together.

Most of my nerves had been strangled out of me as my tie was so tight. Any that remained were put to rest as my blushless bride drew level… and for good reason. My soon-to-be we Teresa had hardly come dressed for the occasion, opting for denim jeans, black jumper… and no veil. For while this was my first time, Teresa had been here before – many, many times. “We have come together in the presence of God to witness and bless the joining together of Luke Phillips and Savana Bishop,” incants “minister” Tom Kennedy. Turning to me, he asks: “Chris, as proxy for Luke, will you have the woman, Savana, to be your we, to live together in the covenant of marriage  “Will you love her, comfort her, honour and keep her, in sickness and in health and forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live ” “I will,” I proudly reply. And within no more than  seconds, the new Mrs and Mrs Phillips are pronounced husband and we. There was no kiss or even embrace. There was no time. Because we were not done yet. We had another wedding. And then, another. Because this is Montana, the only state to allow the double-proxy wedding, where the presence of neither the bride nor the groom is required. Instead, the couples simply need a pair of willing stand-ins to act on their behalf. This is where I came in. The man marrying myself and my proxy bride, who by now has been wed almost , times, was none other than her husband. Together, former LA firefighter Tom and wedding planner Teresa run a business arranging marriages for thousands of people around the world unable to attend their own ceremonies. Acting as a proxy I had joined an elite club – taking part in a style of wedding that had seen Henry IV, Charles I and Napoleon all marry using surrogate spouses. The obscure Montana law dates back to the gold rush in the s and was initially designed as a way to help out miners.  Tom explains: “Their girlfriends could be hundreds,not thousands, of miles away. It was not seen as proper to bring them to tough all-male mining communities to get married.” In those days, double-proxy marriage was legal in the Treasure State for anyone who applied, from anywhere in the world. But as lawmakers grew wise to its potential abuse the law was changed some  years ago. Now one of the two getting wed must be a resident of Montana – or on active armed services duty. The Kennedys run their Armed Forces Proxy Marriages from their home in Big Fork, and have married thousands of couples since , including dozens of UK brides.  The proxy marriage is not a lesser form of union, and comes with the same responsibilities as any other. And while Montana offers proxy marriages, proxy orces are out. Tom says: “It’s a very historic law that many are unaware of, including many government officials. When marrying in Montana you don’t need to be a minister, a magistrate or a judge to conduct the service. The only qualication you need is to be of sound mind. People can even marry each other.”While Tom and Teresa normally marry around  couples a month, the coronavirus has seen April surpass  ceremonies.Couples who would usually marry in the few days off between basic and advanced training have been unable to leave their bases. The need for them to tie the knot is not only out of love, but in some ways out of necessity. Tom explains: “As a girlfriend or boyfriend of someone in the military they hold no rights. But as a husband or we, they benefit from all that goes with being in the forces. Everything from housing and health is taken care off, but crucially it allows couples to remain together wherever they are stationed throughout the world.” The cost of their wedding, which covers all court, legal and arrangement fees, is a small price for the benefits once married. Over the years the Kennedys have seen brides and grooms aged from  to , have had “repeat customers”, and once wed a serial killer in the army, serving his time in a military prison. “That one didn’t last long,” Tom says.

Lawyers want to quiz the woman – described as “a striking, tall blonde with a posh accent” – as a witness. A Sunday Mirror probe can reveal flight logs show she travelled on Epstein’s private plane dubbed the Lolita Express. We can also reveal:The woman – now married to a multi-millionaire – jetted between his homes in New York, the Caribbean, Florida and New Mexico. She was among guests at his ranch Zorro – where pictures of young girls adorned the walls and pinhole cameras were “everywhere”. Staff at Zorro, near Albuquerque, say Andrew visited at least twice and was “holed up” in the grounds for several days as girls provided massages for Epstein and his guests. Lawyers for Epstein’s victims have asked to interview the woman, who featured in his “little black book” of social contacts.Fellow UK socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, , is said to have introduced her to Epstein. Ghislaine was Epstein’s girlfriend and is alleged to have acted as a “fixer” – arranging young girls for the American. She denies wrongdoing. Attorney Josh Schiller told the Sunday Mirror he has contacted the unnamed woman at her UK home. “I can confirm that we have already asked to interview her,” he told us. Mr Schiller represents victims including Virginia Gufre,  – whose claims are central to the scandal engulfing the Queen’s son. Virginia says she was forced to have sex with Andrew when she was .  The Duke, , has always strongly denied the allegations and any accusations of wrongdoing. Epstein, , was found dead in his cell last August while awaiting trial for underage sex trafficking. It is understood the second British woman, whose identity is known to the FBI, has not responded to the lawyers’ requests. A second attorney, David Boies – who represents alleged victims including Sarah Ransome and Marijke Chartouni – said: “She is somebody who we hope to co-operate with us as a witness. She hasn’t responded yet. I think she may very well refuse, although she is not a target.”  The woman, a regular on the high class London social scene, was seen at Epstein’s side at Zorro, where staff say she stayed in the “bunkhouse”. There is no suggestion she took part in any physical abuse of victims. Records show she flew to New Mexico on at least five occasions – once from Palm Beach, Florida, where Epstein had a £million home. Documents show she also jetted between his other properties – a £million New York townhouse and his -acre island in the Caribbean. And further records show a trip between Epstein’s home and Ohio.  In New Mexico, the tycoon’s former staff say they looked after Andrew on at least two occasions after he flew into Albuquerque airport with his bodyguard and Ghislaine. They claim he spent “several days” there as girls provided massages. Ex-ranch hands – banned from the main house when he was staying – acknowledge they saw nothing untoward by Andrew. But they found it “impossible” he could not have known of Epstein’s perversion towards young girls or have suspicions about him. One ex-employee said: “The reason why Mr Epstein would use Zorro was for privacy. It’s why he bought the place. The nearest anyone can get is a mile away unless you work there or were a guest. Mr Epstein and his guests could do anything. No one would never find out. “Whenever His Highness was at the ranch, preparation began days before.”  Former Zorro housekeeper Deidre Stratton previously claimed Andrew, who US investigators say has given “zero co-operation” in the ongoing FBI investigation into Epstein, spent time with a “beautul young neurosurgeon” when he stayed at the ranch. She claimed the Duke was “kept company” by the woman for three days. Turning to the secret cameras inside the home, the employee added: “They were everywhere. The only place they weren’t was in the Lodge House where Andrew slept. “As soon as he stepped out he was on film. There were pinhole cameras everywhere, all of which recorded.  “We suspected Mr Epstein could view the footage even when not there.” During Andrew’s calamitous interview with BBC’s Newsnight last year, which ultimately ended his public duties, he admitted staying with the paedophile in New York, Palm Beach and on his private Caribbean island. Interviewer Emily Maitlis, however, failed to ask whether he’d also visited Epstein at his ranch – and Andrew has never spoken of his time at Zorro. Ex-employees have said the home was adorned with pictures of young girls. “There was no way people could not have seen them,” another one said.  In  Epstein’s former butler Juan Alessi claimed Prince Andrew visited the Palm Beach property “three or four times” in the s. Alessi said bedrooms contained boxes full of sex toys and bathrooms came with phallic-shaped soap. Police who raided the property in  were said to have found a photo of a young girl bending over, her lower half exposed. Another member of staff recalled, around , receiving a call from Epstein demanding staff take down all the pictures.  “He didn’t say why but was agitated and told us to stop whatever we were doing and take them down,” they said. Staff only realised the urgency after discovering police in Florida had begun investigating their boss for underage prostitution. Epstein was jailed for procuring a minor for prostitution and served  months before being released under house arrest in . Andrew sparked embarrassment for Buckingham Palace when he was pictured that year with the paedophile following a more than decade-long friendship. The Prince was once videoed peering from behind the door of Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse. Epstein and Andrew were also famously photographed strolling through Central Park in New York. Andrew entertained Epstein at Windsor, Sandringham and Balmoral. The Duke’s former we Sarah Ferguson accepted £, from the financier to help pay off her debts. She was later threatened with legal action by Epstein after she called him a paedophile. Fergie apologised for accepting his cash. She issued a statement saying it was an “error of judgment”, stating: “I abhor paedophilia.” Andrew stepped down from royal duties last year after more details of his friendship with Epstein emerged. In the Newsnight interview he denied a liaison with Ms Gufre in London on March ,  – saying he had been at Pizza Express in Woking with his daughter Beatrice that evening. Palace officials are facing a further headache as the Epstein saga will be shown to a fresh audience on May  with a four-part documentary on Netflix called Filthy Rich.Epstein was found dead in his cell at a Manhattan jail last August. Forensic pathologist Michael Baden, who was hired by the tycoon’s family, believes Epstein’s autopsy suggests homicide rather than suicide.

It was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.In a report, the researchers wrote: Speech droplets generated by asymptomatic carriers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus are increasingly considered to be a likely mode of disease transmission.Highly sensitive laser light scattering observations have revealed that loud speech can emit thousands of oral fluid droplets per second. In a closed, stagnant air environment, they disappear from the window of view with time constants in the range of  to  min. These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments. The report added: We estimate that  min of loud speaking generates at least , virion-containing droplet nuclei that remain airborne for more than  min. These therefore could be inhaled by others and... trigger a new SARS-CoV- infection.

My plan was to work as hard as I could to be part of the team.“If they wanted things done a certain way then I was going to do that to the best of my ability thenit doesn’t work out, I’ve done all I can.“There were big changes to training but going away for three weeks in pre-season to Italy was a big one. Usually you’d only be away for a week but this was a long time.“They did lay everything that was to happen out in front of you, though. However, there was a strict menu on offer –you didn’t like it, you’d go hungry.”Training too was completely dferent as Dundee adopted a football strategy that had served the Bonetti brothers in their homeland.As a future coach and boss, Smith says he learned a lot during their time in the City of Discovery, evensome elements of their approach were dficult to get to grips with.“The way they structured training was completely dferent as well but dferent managers all have dferent views,” he added.“Training would change time but we’d train every day and there were a few double sessions.“They relied on doing the same thing rigidly over and over so you knew what you were getting and there was very little change.“I have to say I learned a lot about working on shape and positional play. Previous managers had done shape but not to the extent the Bonettis worked on it.“Training could be a bit off-the-cuff sometimes. They were obviously new to coaching themselves and learning as they went.”There were high-profile disagreements as foreign signings kept Scottish players out of the starting XI.The Bonetti brothers’ volatile nature also led to fall outs behind the scenes, but Smith focused on working hard in training and reaping the rewards.“I always treat people as they treat me and the Bonettis treated me very well,” he said.“I’m not saying they did that with every player – there were definitely a few not treated as well as they should have been.“I played with players I never expected to line up alongside at Dundee. Georgi Nemsadze was wonderful, Claudio Caniggia was a top talent, but they also needed the Scottish guys like myself, Gav Rae, Steven Tweed and Willie Falconer to make the core of the team.“I don’t think the foreign guys really understood Scottish football or knew what to expect.“We all just got our heads down and knuckled down to work. I think the Bonettis appreciated that.“They were good times and I’m sure the fans wouldn’t change seeing those players in dark blue even with what happened afterwards in administration.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53776512-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53776512-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53776512-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53776512-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united johnny russell transfer news","story":"Ex-Dundee United star Johnny Russell is open to ato Tannadice.Russell is back in training with MLS side Sporting Kansas City, with whom he has established himself as a fan-favourite.But while he is loving le in the States, Russell is not against the idea of finishing his playing career back where it started.“I had a great relationship with the fans – hopefully at some point I will maybe get the chance to get myself there,” Russell said of United to the BBC.“I wouldn’t say I have got a desire to come back – I love it where I am – but I would never turn my nose up to come back and play in Scotland.”Russell spent five successful years with Derby County after leaving United in .His subsequent move to the US, aged just , came as a shock.But his red hot MLS form has led to continued Scotland recognition – and paved the way for former United man Gary Mackay-Steven and ex-Celtic kid Lewis Morgan to join him in the States.For Russell, success in America has vindicated his leap of faith.“I said at the time that I felt it was the right decision.

If you had to have them it would be in a final, but the draw was kind to us with Raith.“They’d been doing well under John McGlynn but it gave us an opportunity to go to Hampden.“One of the things that sticks in my mind is we had the Sunday game but on Saturday, Ross County were playing Celtic.“We were going to the Westerwood Hotel in Cumbernauld to stay overnight.“We’d trained at Tannadice and headed down. I was off to Falkirk to watch them play St Mirren but Gary Kirk and Paul Hegarty went with the team on the bus.“I was listening to the radio all the way and about half-way down Ross County went one-up.“By the time I’m in the car park at Falkirk, Ross County score again with minutes to go to make it - and it really hit me then.“That was the first time I thought to myself, ‘There’s only three teams left and we’re now the favourites for the cup’.“I felt a bit of pressure going into the Raith Rovers game that we had to go out and do our business.“We were nervous but, thankfully, I had a group of players behind me who were magnicent and we beat Raith comfortably after a slow -minute start.”Although they were indeed favourites at that stage to go on and lt the cup, Houston insists that wasn’t always the case.The -year-old believes the Tangerines still had to do it the hard way in beating Partick, St Johnstone and champions Rangers after a replay to get their shot at Hampden glory.He continues: “A lot of people say Dundee United had it easy because we played Ross County in the final but they forget about the journey.“The fact is we had an away game at Partick Thistle then we were away to Premier League St Johnstone in the next round. That’s never an easy fixture.“We went down there and I remember Gary’s father had died during that week.“The players decided they wanted to wear black armbands and dedicated the win to Bobby Kirk, who was an ex-Hearts league and cup winner way back.“It was a nice gesture for the players, that’s the type of boys they were.“We went to Ibrox after that to play a strong Rangers side, who were the champions.“That was three in a row away from home in the Scottish Cup so we didn’t have an easy draw.“We were - down after Rangers got a couple of penalties, the usual at Ibrox, but to our credit we scored goals.“To see Andis Shala and Mihael Kovacevic on the scoresheet was something unusual. We got a wee break as well with wee Morgaro Gomis’ volley being deflected in.“They thought the game was won at -. They had downed tools a bit and the crowd was away to miss the traffic.“That set us up for our only home tie, the replay at Tannadice. That was a memorable game for the supporters.“The treble-buster, as he calls himself, David Robertson scored with his backside in the last minute.“That was the best thing for us because there wasn’t much time for Rangers to go and put up a comeback.“We were the better team and deserved to win.”United would see off Ross County in the final thanks to a second-half strike from David Goodwillie and a Craig Conway double.Nearly , Arabs rejoiced in watching on as Houston  Co climbed the steps to lt the Scottish Cup for the first time since .He continues: “It hits you when you’re walking out prior to kick-off and it’s just a sea of tangerine.“There were , Arabs there and that was a sight to behold. It’s so colourful.“A lot of people thought it wouldn’t be a good atmosphere because it was Dundee United and a smaller club like Ross County but to be fair to them I think Dingwall emptied for that day.“It was a busy final and the pressure was on us that we should win this cup.“There’s an added pressure there because you’re desperately keen to not mess it up for the fans.“The Saturday night and Sunday celebrations at Tannadice and City Square were amazing.“It’s something you can’t take away from that group of players and it will never leave my memory.”The celebrations would go on for days after but it is only now Houston looks back at their win as greatness achieved not bestowed.He credits predecessor Craig Levein for laying the foundations and admits there is a special sense of pride at achieving Scottish Cup glory, something the man who started it all, Jim McLean, couldn’t do.“As you get older you start asking yourself, ‘Where did those  years go to ’” he says.“It brought joy to a lot of United fans who’d only seen them win it once prior with Ivan Golac.“It felt surreal that Jim, who was the best manager of them all, hadn’t been able to get it over line with the amount of times he took United to Scottish Cup Finals.“It was great for me, personally, being the manager of United then and doing that.“The big thing for me was we had a brilliant group of players.“Craig and I had went in a few years before and he deserves credit as well. Him and I worked really hard building a new squad.“We were bottom of the league when we went in back in . Wee Eddie Thompson’s only words to Craig and I were, ‘Just keep my team in the top ision’.“We managed to finish ninth that season then fth for the next couple of years.“I was delighted that when I took over and Craig went away to be the Scotland manager we finished third, won the cup and went into Europe three years in a row.“It had been a long time for the club since it had been on that stage and they haven’t been since.“A lot of people forget that, yes we won the Scottish Cup, but we finished third behind a very strong Rangers and Celtic, and nine points ahead of Hibs.“It was a magnicent achievement and turned out a wonderful season.”Dundee United#s Scottish Cup-winning boss Peter Houston hopes Robbie Neilson can lead Terrors to Hampden triumph\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-peter-houston-robbie-neilson embed # secretIXeWqxySKj\" data-secret\"IXeWqxySKj\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.49251506-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.49251506-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.49251506-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.49251506-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"revealed dario bonetti kicked rugby park","story":"The Bonetti era at Dundee didn’t throw up many dull moments – and Kilmarnock fans will certainly remember the night assistant Dario entertained them in the stands at Rugby Park.A combination of a car accident, a paperwork error and Bonetti missing a Killie goal saw Ayrshire fans that night experience both sides of the charismatic and, at times, volatile Italian.With no place on the bench for Dark Blues assistant manager, Dario watched the game from the press box behind the home supporters in the main stand.The Evening ’s former senior football writer, Tom Duthie, had a front-row seat to the spectacle.He said: “Most of the squad had travelled the night before the game, but Dario Bonetti was heading west on the Saturday.“Unfortunately an accident blocked the main road between Glasgow and Kilmarnock and along with most fans, and press, Dario did not arrive at Rugby Park in time for kick off.“When he got there he found his name had not been included on the official list of those in the Dundee technical area and, for once, the assistant manager had to head for the stand to observe the action.“Along with full-back Marcello Marrocco, who was injured, he decided to join us in the press box at the back of the main stand.“Given that the stand is for home fans, it crossed my mind this could lead to problems because I knew there was no way the passionate Italian would stay quiet. He didn#t.“But as well as kicking every ball for his team, big Dario also engaged with the punters sitting nearby and gave them what must have been one of their most entertaining match experiences ever.“Unfortunately for Dario his late arrival meant he missed an opening goal for Killie and although Dundee equalised before the break he was still unaware of it as he headed for the dressing-room at half-time.“There were some confused players in there as he blasted them and told them they were lucky to be ahead.“When he repeated that opinion on retaking his seat for the second-half I can remember a couple of awkward minutes as Marrocco, Dundee#s press officer Niall Scott and I discussed who should be the one to tell him the correct score.“I escaped that dangerous task by pointing out I was not a club employee and they were.“If memory serves me, it was Marrocco who broke the news, to be met with an eruption from his assistant gaffer.“I should add that outside of game time, Dario was as charming as his brother.“In their first season together the pair steered Dundee to a top six finish and produced a team capable of playing football that was as pleasing on the eye as anything theof the country.“As their second season progressed, however, Ivano was making increasingly frequent trips back to Italy and it was clear all was not well behind the scenes.“It came as no surprise when he was replaced by Jim Duffy in the summer of  and in just over another year the extent of the club#s spending during the Bonetti experiment became clear as it plunged into administration and was on the brink of extinction.“For all that, Dundee fans understandably remember those two years with great fondness, as do press men like myself who experienced a time the like of which is highly unlikely to be seen again.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

their services during the coronavirus pandemic as it relies on donations to keep them going.Anyone can take part by texting CHARLIESOS to , which will automatically donate £.Susan Crighton, director of fundraising for Charlie House, said: “For families in the UK, we have had to adapt to a very dferent way of le over the last couple of months.“We have had to adjust to le without access to mainstream schooling, activity clubs, friends and grandparents, all of which help give us an opportunity to rest and recharge.“While many will say there have been wonderful moments that they will cherish, most will also say that it has been really challenging having their support network removed.“For Charlie House supported families, dficulties in accessing specialist care for a child with complex disabilities means that only families often meet % of their child’s care requirements with little or no opportunity for respite.“The risk of complications from what we regard as everyday infections can result in long periods of isolation for children with complex disabilities and their families. That is why what we do is so important.”The charity is currently carrying out its services by facilitating regular video calls for therapeutic and emotional support, liaising with medical teams and providing pre and post-bereavement support, as well as creating and delivering isolation packs.Online activity sessions are also being used as a means to continue aiding those struggling.Susan added: “It has always been our mission to provide support to babies, children and young people that have le-limiting conditions and their families by helping provide access to the right care, information, activities and, ultimately, a purpose-built respite care facility in the north-east.“The need now is greater than ever for this.

There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings. They had a good day and brought the car home in th overall and eighth in a competitive Class . They plan to do the full season, so watch this space for updates on their progress.The closely contested event was finally won by Michael Binnie and Clare Mole in a Mitsubishi Evo, with the ever present Jock Armstrong and Cameron Fair taking second place in the TEG Sport Impreza, after leading the rally for much of the day. Freddie Milne and Patrick Walsh in the Fiesta R were third overall.Next up is the Speyside Rally in Elgin on April ."},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre has its finger on the pulse","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Soccer Centre volunteers have received vital first aid training.Sports clubs are required to ensure a number of their volunteers have a valid first aid certicate and when Lochgilphead Soccer Centre looked to secure the services of an accredited firm to provide the required two-day course, outdoor and first aid coach Andy Craven was happy to help.Covering theory and practice of all fundamental aspects of first aid, the volunteers were grateful to Andy for his informative and interactive approach to learning important skills and knowledge to safeguard the welfare of players and spectators.Soccer Centre chairman Stuart Green  said: #It is not just about having the relevant certicate, but ensuring a good number of our volunteers have the knowledge, skills and equipment to look after our youngsters and their friends and families.#Knocks and sprains are common in football and we deal with them every week, however, even as volunteers, we have an obligation to be prepared with any eventuality and Andy was first class in guiding our volunteers through a range of scenarios.#Andy said: #Whilst first aid is a serious business, the folks at Lochgilphed Soccer Centre were a great bunch. They were keen to learn and kept me on my toes with a range of questions.#I am a qualied outdoor and first aid instructor and have been working with community and sports groups throughout Argyll and Bute and their enthusiasm and desire to develop skills to look after members of their community in the event of something going wrong never ceases to impress me.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

A community buy-out was, in fact, an option mooted in the bad old days, but negotiations proved dficult at that time.With a new spirit of openness, this has to be an opportunity worth grasping. Inveraray has pretty well lost its connection with Loch Fyne since the pier has been out of bounds. To have full control over the pier is something townsfolk have dreamt of for years.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll.

It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall.

In March , HS Ltd formally told the Department it had breached the terms of the Development Agreement, and would be unable to deliver the programme to cost and schedule ndash yet the Permanent Secretary did not inform the committee on either appearance that the programme was in trouble.ldquoThis is a serious breach of the departmentrsquos duty to Parliament and hence to the public, which as the report says, will undermine confidence. Furthermore, the PAC was in the dark about serious cost overruns and was therefore unable to do its duty to inform Parliament that value for money on the project was at risk.ldquoThe cost overruns have been blamed partly on the speed that the hybrid Bill committee for Phase One proceeded with.

This year the figure fell to less than  per cent.The council also refuses to allow children whose parents opt to keep them home and fund the nursery place themselves to remain in school nurseries.Parents who decide to pay for an additional year of nursery themselves to keep their children out for a year face bills of up to pound, and a hunt for alternative child care places.Another mum who was refused funding said she had initially been supported in her view that her child was too immature to start school by her nursery.But they withdrew that support after pressure from the councilrsquos education department, she said.ldquoThey were told that they couldnrsquot support us because we didnrsquot meet the council policy criteria and withdrew their support, she explained.ldquoOur views meant nothing and the impact on our child meant nothing.And other parents expressed fears that their children were being robbed of nursery experience because they have been in lockdown for some of the vital months they would have had and would have no transition into school.One mum said: Children who start school at -years-old already receive a year less nursery time than those who are older, that has been reduced further by the closure of nurseries.ldquoHow can we ask these young children to go from months at home with their family to suddenly starting primary one with no transition A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoconfirmed they have now agreed to approve all deferral requests for the year ahead.They said: ldquoAs a result of the ongoing closure of schools and nurseries, we have been reviewing applications for deferred entry to P, ahead of session  . Due to the current situation, applications for deferred entry and a further funded year have now been approved.

reopening, Mr Eustice said: ldquoI think our view is that probably a McDonaldrsquos drive-thru is made for the social distancing situation we are in, in that people do not leave their car, they place their order and someone passes a bag of food to them at the end through a kiosk.Unlike many other businesses, fast-food outlets were not mandated to close during the lockdown.Some chains have begun to

restaurants opening for deliveries from next week.Askedoutlets could have stayed open during the crisis, Mr Eustice said: ldquoWhile clearly restaurants and pubs had to close, we were quite keen to keep that capacity to be able to do takeaway food for people.He suggested reduced footfall in town centres, staff anxiety and a sense of what was ldquosocially acceptable given the stay-at-home message had led to places such as McDonaldrsquos and KFC closing.Mr Eustice added: ldquoI think it is quite possible for these venues to reopen and reopen safely, we never mandated that they should close.ldquoI think some of those food-to-go businesses will probably be seeking to learn lessons from what supermarkets have done as they consider tentatively reopening.New safety measures have been

have been tested and could be opened immediately to host tourists, Friedrich Joussen, TUI Group CEO said.Several other European holiday spots could also be among the list of destinations, including Greece, Cyprus, Croatia and Bulgaria, all of which Joussen described as ldquowell prepared for summer tourism.Austria and Denmark were named as possible destinations as well, being among a number of EU countries that are starting to reopen their borders.However, the roll out of flights to Europe will have to be done gradually, and in line with both government guidance on travel and the lting of EU borders.Holidays to Europe are also likely to be hindered by the  day quarantine period being enforced by many countries, with tourists faced with spending two weeks in quarantine in Spain before being able to start their holiday.In contrast, visits to France and Ireland will be unhindered by such rules.How will TUI make its hotels safe The package holiday specialist has outlined a ten-point plan, detailing how hotels will operate after lockdown is lted.Plans include restrictions on its popular self-service buffets, which are due to be reduced to a minimum.Instead, food and beverages will be served to guests by staff wearing protective masks, where possible.The measures will be implemented across all of the companyrsquos own-brand hotels, and will also be made ldquoavailable to joint-venture and partner hotels.Guests will face limits on their range of entertainment and activities, with football tournaments set to be banned.Only events, sports and entertainment that involve a small number of participants, and without close contact, will be made available.Other measures include online check-ins, maintaining social distancing in public areas, such as gyms and corridors, and reduced capacity in restaurants, with longer opening hours to spread guest usage.There will also be an increase in disinfectant dispensers throughout TUIrsquos hotels, and ldquoextensive new cleaning practices will be implemented for rooms.TUI said that its new  point plan is in addition to statutory regulations, which will be put in place at all of the holiday destinations where it operates.The

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig. He went to Sabhal Mograver to improve his language skills and says he would not hold his present job had he not become a fluent speaker.ldquoI was fully immersed in the language at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, which is essential to become fluent in any language. he says. ldquoYou could hear Gaelic being spoken every day, in every situation and that helped me no end in improving my own Gaelic. I gained a great deal of confidence in terms of Gaelic grammar, spelling and writing, all of which has been invaluable in my working le.BBC weather presenter, Joy Dunlop, is another graduate of the college who says the fluency in Gaelic she developed at the college has given her many opportunities that she otherwise would not have had.She studied Gaelic as a second language when she was a pupil at Oban High School then decided to do her sixth year at the college. She initially planned to stay for just one year to do the Cugraversa Comais but loved it so much she stayed for four, graduating with a BAin Cagravenan agus Cultar na Gagraveidhlig .ldquoAttending Sabhal Mograver was a revelation for me, she says. ldquoThe education I received was unparalleled.ldquoThe personal support and guidance I received from all the staff was of the highest level and I always felt that our teachers were genuinely invested in both the language itself and our progress.ldquoBeing immersed in the language is definitely the best way to learn, dficult as it could be at times, and having the opportunity to speak Gaelic in both the classes and the community was a real help to me.ldquoSimply,you genuinely want to learn Gaelic, there is no better place to do so than Sabhal Mograver Ostaig.

A resilient food economy is predicated on supporting our native farmers. Yet major food retailers, companies fond of bragging about how they support British and Scottish farming, are loading their beef shelves with imported meat.Why on earth are retailers favouring Irish beef over Scotch  Itrsquos not asScottish farmers canrsquot supply enough to feed us. The answer is disconcerting. Irish beef is more profitable to stock because the Irish government is paying a Covid- subsidy to its beef industry. This allows it to dump cheap beef onto the UK and Scottish market leaving our local beef suppliers out in the cold.For supermarkets,you view it purely as an economic proposition, subsidised Irish beef is a no-brainer. They can buy it cheaper than Scotch, yet sell it for the established retail price, and be quids in. Bear in mind that our major flood retailers arenrsquot short of a bob or two at the moment.The UK Government has handed them hundreds of millions in business rate relief ndash thatrsquos our taxpayersrsquo cash ndash while they support the food chain in Poland and Ireland. And as the eating out sector has disappeared, supermarkets have benefited directly, showing their strongest sustained sales period for years.Make no mistake about it. If supermarkets get away with building their beef supply chain on imports, Scottish beef farmers might as well shut up shop now.Given the rate that state-aid subsidised meat imports are flooding into the country, we wonrsquot have a livestock industry left. So,you do buy your beef in supermarkets, herersquos my plea. If you spot Irish beef in your store, embarrass the retailer in question by putting a picture on social media, accompanied by the obvious question: lsquoHerersquos supermarket X selling imported beef instead of Scotch. Why Or make an online complaint. Even speak to the store manager, from a suitable distance away, of course. This is a really important consumer battle.If we want Scotland to keep on producing its world renowned, grass-fed beef, we must embarrass the retailers that undermine our native beef farmers while posturing about their steadfast support for them. In fact, why not dump supermarket beef shopping and start buying from an independent butcher, farm shop, or online, direct from the farmer I avoid shopping in supermarkets, but evenyoursquore a supermarket regular, yoursquoll likely accept that meat is not their strongest department. Neither the eating quality of their beef, nor their butchery, can compare with that of a skilled, specialist butcher. And they donrsquot stock a full, nose-to-tail range of cuts, preferring to sell us mountains of nondescript mince and anonymous lsquosteakrsquo and lsquostewrsquo cuts that are taste ndash and tenderness ndash challenged.Proper butchers, by contrast, can be relied on to source Scotch beef first and foremost, beef that eats well. The best amongst them usually know the farm and farmers that produced it.Stocking up family freezers before lockdown, I gave my daughter mince from my local butcher. When she got round to cooking it, she phoned me up to ask me what it was. ldquoIt smells so good, and itrsquos just so dferent from supermarket mince. The smell as you fry that up makes me feel sick. But this makes my mouth water.Why the contrast  As I discovered when I investigated supermarket meat for my book Shopped ndash The Shocking Power of British Supermarkets, the butchering in the meat plants that supply them is crude, often careless.The beef is rarely adequately aged, and must, through the application of modied air packaging, look wet and ruby-red when packed. Any good cook or chef knows that this state does not make for rewarding eating. Why make do with supermarket beef when you could be eating the good stuff "},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-pretence-transparency-not-scotland-needs","story":"In recent weeks, ministers north and south have been falling over themselves to embrace their fallibility. Mistakes will be made in the handling of the coronavirus, they say. Wersquore learning on the job. But trust us, wersquore doing our best.Nicola Sturgeon, for example, told Holyrood on Wednesday: ldquoI said that I would make mistakes and that the Government would make mistakes, and I am sure that is the case.ldquoWe are dealing with an unprecedented situation.Irsquom sure she and counterparts are doing their best as they wrestle with the unknown, and footling administrative bungles are being conceded along the way.But when it comes to the big stuff that could have cost lives, itrsquos back to the usual spikey defensiveness.The UK Government missing its , tests a day target  Not a mistake, ministers cry every pm. You lot donrsquot understand success.The Scottish Government missing its , tests a day target  Not a blunder either, comes the response. Itrsquos all going pretty well, considering.Just donrsquot mention it would take almost two years to test everyone in Scotland and the UK at this rate.As for Covid scything through care homes, itrsquos nothing to do with us, Guv.Take Boris Johnsonrsquos misleading bluster when cornered by Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs this week.ldquoIt remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care homehellipwill become infected, the Labour leader quoted from the UK Government official advice in place up to March .ldquoNot true that the advice said that, replied the PM, instantly grasping the political danger of such insouciance,not grasping the facts.But it was exactly what it said.:Councils face poundm lockdown shortfallThe guidance is there on the UK Government website under a warning that it was withdrawn on March .Thatrsquos more transparency than you get with the Scottish Governmentrsquos website, where withdrawn guidance has been vigorously deleted.Like the official advice to care homes published on March  which gives a chilling clue as to why almost half the Covid- deaths in Scotland have occurred under care home roofs.ldquoIt is not advised that residents [with Covid] in long term care are admitted to hospital for ongoing management but are managed within their current setting, it told staff.In other words, Scots homes were discouraged from sending Covid patients to a hospital, despite the fuller range of care on offer and the higher grade PPE there, plus the risk of sick residents acting as sources of infection to others in the home.The latest version of this guidance, published yesterday, says a transfer to a hospital ldquoshould take place after a clinical assessment that is in the best interest of the resident, in keeping with their choices, and where the care required cannot be done in the home.The March  document also says new residents arriving from hospital ldquodo not routinely need confirmation of a negative Covid test. Now two negative results are mandatory.You wonrsquot find it easy to compare one version with the other, however, because the first has been all but scrubbed from the internet. It lingers on in a handful of web caches.But asked on Wednesdayshe thought early mistakes led to excess deaths and testing in homes had been a failure, Ms Sturgeon was emphatic. ldquoNo, I do not, she told MSPs.She then said the high mortality rate was ldquonot caused by our handling the virus in care homes as other countries are it is intrinsic to the dficult nature of the virus. Intrinsic to the virus. Oh well then. Thatrsquos that.The Scottish Government was also apparently blameless in its handling of our first big Covid outbreak, when  people, eight from Scotland, caught it at a Nike conference in Edinburghrsquos Hilton Carlton in late February.Ministers knew about it by March , when cases started appearing, but still let Scotland play France at Murrayfield five days later, and didnrsquot ban large gathering until March .They said nothing about the Nike incident for two months, until a BBC documentary revealed it last week.:Letters: We are being held back by the timidity of the Scottish GovernmentMs Sturgeon denies a cover-up, saying the first case was mentioned at the time in a press release. However, that merely referred to an infected person in Scotland who ldquohad contact with a known positive case, without saying they caught it in Scotland, far less a major outbreak in Edinburgh.The First Minister says she accepted advice that patient confidentiality could have been compromisedshersquod said more, but that was looking at the issue the wrong way around.ldquoThe thing that wasnrsquot said was that there were a number of cases associated with one event, she said. Well quite. Thatrsquos the problem.Ms Sturgeon also says everyone who needed to be contact-traced was contact-traced. But that assumes a perfect system in which everyone remembered exactly who they met for  minutes or more over  hours. Publicising the outbreak would have helped identy people who would otherwise have been missed.Quizzed by the media on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon insisted she was satisfied at the time, and remains satisfied, that ldquoall appropriate steps were taken.However her knowledge of what happened at the time seems hazy.ldquoIrsquom not even sure I knew what the venue was until it was reported in this programme, she blurted out.Itrsquos hard to see how she could be happy all steps were taken without knowing basics like that. The venue was not some isolated country retreat. It was a very large hotel on one of the busiest streets in Scotlandrsquos capital, a few yards from the Royal Mile. That information was surely relevant, and her lack of curiosity looks culpable.This retreat from candour is especially worrying as we pivot to the next phase of the crisis, and the ginger easing of the lockdown. Ms Sturgeon must give an update by May .When Mr Johnson replaced Stay at Home with Stay Alert in England, the First Minister and others complained it was vague and imprecise advice.It was, next to Stay at Home. That was as definitive as it gets. The next phase will be vague and imprecise.Even the Scottish Governmentrsquos latest framework paper on easing the lockdown says people will need to ldquoremain vigilant for symptoms of Covid in others, aka stay alert.Asked for her superior alternative slogan last week, Ms Sturgeon tellingly failed to offer one.The months ahead will be messy. As people go out more, the virus will go with them. The R number will flutter disconcertingly. Politicians will make more mistakes. The stressed-out ones in office will doubtless seethe about mouthy idlers in opposition.But truth and transparency will serve everyone better than carping and sour denials. Instead of all this professed openness and honesty, the country will need the real thing."},{"url":null,"title":"americans-love-scotland-much-visit-californias-scotsfestival-find","story":"ACCIDENTALLY admit to an American that you are Scottish and you can generally expect to hear either that they are Scottish, too, that it is their dream to visit Scotland, or that their forefathers came from a place called lsquoGlass-gowrsquo and perhaps you have heard of it I am never prouder of our country than when I am away from it, but living amongst such unearned devotion has often led me to wonder just what it is about our little nation that inspires such affection. Is it our renowned landscapes, our progressive politics or our mind-blowing litany of world-changing inventions  Is it our whisky, our golf, our Andy Murray  Is it simply our legendary humility Fortunately, I knew where to look for the answer, because each summer many Americans demonstrate their affinity for our country by attending Scottish festivals. Here in Calornia, the season kicks off early with the Scotsfestival, held aboard and alongside the Clydebank-built RMS Queen Mary at its permanent mooring in the Los Angeles suburb of Long Beach.I drove down to Scotsfestival ndash whose website, it may be worth noting, optimistically describes Clydebank as a lsquoquaint seaside townrsquo ndash on a sunny Saturday morning with The Proclaimers cranked all the way up. As Craig and Charlie lamented, lsquoAll the blood that flowed away, across the ocean to the second chancersquo, I joined in full-throatedly, even though I myself have long since become that blood.When I arrive at mid-morning, the Scotsfestival is in full swing and the Queen Mary looks resplendent in her black, red, and white Cunard stripes. There is nowhere to buy anything resembling breakfast or even coffee, but the bars are already doing a spectacular trade. Currently a month and a half into a dry , I feel asI am letting our national side down.On a field enclosed by a white picket fence, the Highland Games are already underway. A woman in a mini-kilt and Led Zeppelin T-shirt launches a hammer with such extreme power and lack of direction that it almost decapitates a nearby judge this being Southern Calornia, his only reaction is to enthusiastically high five her. The next event is an American invention that involves using a pitchfork to toss a burlap sack over a high bar. Lochaber, no more.In an adjacent area of perfectly green grass, a half dozen immaculate sheep stand aswaiting for their close-up. I take it upon myself to educate their American shepherd, Ted Thompson:he wants his sheep to look authentically Scottish he needs to muddy up their underbellies, spray paint them with a blue hieroglyphic, and ideally set them wandering loose on a country road. Ted politely explains that his sheep look this way because they are decorative sheep, bred not for wool nor meat but simply to look good while being herded. Ted has never been to Scotland, but had ancestors that came from Ayrshire. Keen to make up for my sheep faux-pas, I inform him that Ayrshire is Robert Burnsrsquo country. He is not familiar with lsquoA manrsquos a man for arsquo thatrsquo, but immediately gets the sentiment, pointing out with a wry smile that he has a friend who is a Trump supporter, and yet they manage to find mutual ground.I head next to the lsquoClydebank Crossrsquo, a tented encampment of battle re-enactors. The website promised this would provide lsquoa taste of what it means to be Scottishrsquo through its lsquowoodwork and metalwork demonstrationsrsquo. Woodwork and metalwork have never felt a strong part of my Scottish identity, but the re-enactors are at least demonstrating another of our national characteristics that I can relate to: they feel that they have been treated unfairly, and consequently are morose.Specically, they are unhappy about the location they have been assigned. It is hard to blame them: next to the portaloos and tucked behind a row of mock-Tudor structures still covered in fake snow from last seasonrsquos Winter Wonderland, their encampment will not attract much foot traffic today. They dutully clean their muskets like the good soldiers they are, but their hearts are not entirely in it, a situation they underscore by frequently setting down their muskets to show each other YouTube videos on their iphones.By the time I have wandered through the nearby lsquoVendor Valleyrsquo, my own heart is no longer entirely in it either. The concessions here sell claymores, chain-mail and pikes. The website had claimed this Vendor Valley would lsquotake you back to a Scottish marketrsquo, but it seems another outlandish hope. Perhaps you can pick up a claymore at the Barrasyou know who to ask, but surely no self-respecting Glaswegian stallholder would ever post a sign in a medieval font that proclaims they accept lsquoMaster of the Cardrsquo and lsquoLady Visarsquo.A-Z of Outlander: Everything you need to know about the hit TV showI begin to suspect that that our American cousins donrsquot love Scotland at all, but simply Braveheart and Outlander. Yetthis is the case, I can hardly blame them. Mel Gibson shouting for freedom while wearing blue face paint might be an absurd version of our country, but I mostly exist in an equally delusional version of theirs, one where Martin Sheen is President and acts on the scientic advice he gets from a wise-cracking Jeff Goldblum. This being Los Angeles, even the Queen Mary once starred in a movie, playing herself in the  flop Assault on a Queen, in which Frank Sinatra uses a salvaged Nazi U-boat to conduct an improbable heist on the grand old dame.Outlander centres around Claire Randall, a Second World War era nurse mysteriously transported back to Jacobite times. With each hour I spend at Scotsfestival, I find myself sympathising ever more with her plight. Most of the men here are wearing kilts, and those that are not are sporting T-shirts that pledge allegiance to a clan on the front while listing bloody battles on the back asthey were stadiums on a rock tour: Falkirk , Arbroath , Prestonpans .I call in at one of the T-shirt stalls, but they of course do not have anything for Stephensons. Why would they  It is an English name, and two generations back on my motherrsquos side they were all Irish, so no luck there either. I am a Scotsman that has never had a clan, and a troubling thought now strikes me: is it possible that these Calornians, with their Glengarrys and Jacobite shirts and their fierce Caledonian pride, are actually more Scottish than I am Feeling suddenly homesick, I am fortunate to find myself wandering in to the tent of lsquoClan Inebriatedrsquo. Styled as a clan for all those who do not have one, Clan Inebriatedrsquos motto is lsquoGu Deoch, Gu Cairdean, Gu Sporrsquo ndash lsquoTo drink, to friends, to funrsquo. Clan Inebriatedrsquos members pride themselves on traditional Scottish hospitality, and sure enough a whisky drink is quickly placed in my hand and I am offered a seat on a chair that turns out to also be for sale. Somebody is playing the chanter, and by the time I have finished my drink, I am a member of Clan Inebriated in every sense: dry , no more.When I bid my new kinfolk farewell, they give me another drink lsquofor the roadrsquo. They assure me this is a long-standing Highland tradition, and who am I to argue  Feeling supremely Scottish ndash and more than a little drunk ndash I board the Queen Mary where the Los Angeles Scottish Country Dancing Display Team are about to commence a demonstration. The person standing next to me asksI know Scottish dances and I ndash a proud veteran of many a late-night wedding Strip The Willow ndash confirm that I absolutely do. But then the LASCDDT proceed to dance a Founderrsquos Reel, which seems like a Strip the Willow except it also requires PhDs in Fluid Mechanics and String Theory. The dancers had all seemed to be genteel retirees, but unleashed on a dancefloor they have become the Harlem Globetrotters of Scottish Country Dancing. I leave before anybody gets the idea of making me dance.Down the corridor, a bar has been converted to evoke lsquoa cosy pub in Edinburghrsquos old townrsquo. They have got it spot on, right down to the dingy lighting and the folk musicians annoyed at being talked over. The first item on the pub menu is Haggis, Neeps and Tatties and I cannot resist asking the barmanit is popular. \"People love to hear about it,\" he begins, diplomatically, lsquoAnd they even love to see it too. They just donrsquot actually want to eat it, and usually end up going to the Starbucks on the next deck.\"I slip disgracefully away to Starbucks, order my iced oat milk latte and bagel and head out on to the deck to enjoy them. They are both delicious, but I notice undernotes of shame and betrayal. Still, as I sit there, I hear the familiar rat-a-tat of a snare drum and then the first skirl of the pipes. And soon the sound hits me, the way it always does right in my Scottish heart. I hurry back down to the dockside to see who is making this beautul noise, to find out which storied regimental band are visiting from Scotland.But they are not a regiment, nor soldiers, nor even adults. They are the teenagers of the local Glendora High School Pipe Band. They look resplendent in Royal Stewart kilts, dress black waistcoats and brogues. The music is note perfect, their Scotland the Brave the most rousing I have ever heard. And yet the most wonderful part is the band themselves: they are Angelenos of all heritages, and they are playing our music as well as I have ever heard even though I grew up within earshot of the Edinburgh military tattoo. A proud parent nearby tells me the band have been invited to the world championships in Glasgow this summer they can raise the funds for accommodation. Before they have finished the first tune, I am texting my mother to askshe has room for an entire pipe band.Feeling happier and more proudly Scottish than I have all day, I tour the stalls of the Clan societies. As far as I can fathom, these are groups which allow Americans with Scottish names to fraternise with their fellow MacLeods, MacMillans and Mackintoshes, assharing a surname with a stranger was a bond rather than a mild inconvenience. Clan McPherson have the best branding ndash an emblem of a wildcat, and the motto lsquoTouch not the cat but with a gloversquo ndash and I am therefore disappointed to see that I cannot even claim any of the affiliated surnames listed on their stand. Still, I note that list includes lsquoSmithrsquo, and so I diplomatically suggest to the two American women running the stall that including the most common surname in Britain suggests that Clan McPherson are perhaps not too fussy, and maybe they could therefore affiliate a Stephenson too.Predictably, I am wrong. They explain to me how in  the McPhersons arranged a -man battle with their comrades the Davidsons over the issue of who would stand where during the forthcoming battle with their actual enemy, the Camerons. When the McPhersons arrived a man short for this spectator-sport rammy, a local blacksmith in the audience stepped in, sportingly killed more than his allocation of Davidsons, and hence to this day McPhersons consider all Smiths undisputed kin. This, I tell them, is undoubtedly the most Scottish thing I have ever heard.Both women are regulars on the Scottish Festival circuit ndash Santa Rosa is next in the calendar, followed by Sacramento ndash and so I ask them just what the attraction is. They immediately talk of the bagpipes, and describe the exact feeling I had at the dockside earlier: \"I want to cry when I hear them, I canrsquot even explain it, it strikes something so deep of longing and loss.\"They then go on to talk about the communion the festivals themselves provide: \"Itrsquos like finding lots and lots of distant cousins. It fills this niche inside of us that wants us to feel connected with something that is longer than our own history here in America.\" Not for the first time today, I feel a little churlish for ever having found such earnestly-held affection anything other than profound.At five orsquoclock, the Pipes and Drums prizegiving is held, and the Glendora High School Pipe Band rightly sweep the board. Over in the main field, the Highland Games have progressed to tossing the beer keg which may or may not be an officially-sanctioned event. Down on the dockside, the disgruntled re-enactors have finally taken matters into their own hands and wheeled their cannons out to perform their final display of musket and cannon fire where they can be properly appreciated. The location they have selected is the entrance to the bagpiperrsquos staging area, and the rammy that results would make our own country proud. Kilted pipers yell at musket-wielding soldiers, and for a while it seems like a minor war might break out in the late afternoon. Ancient shouts of \"Fire down!\" and \"Misfire!\" mingle with more modern and less printable ones. It all feels wonderfully Scottish nobody provokes us with impunity, and we do truly love a good stramash.Back at the herding pen, Ted Thompsonrsquos sheep-herding display is now in full flow, his border collie bringing out the best in his Hollywood-ready sheep. He asks the audience to considerhis dog is enjoying his work we all look and see that Tedrsquos dog is not just enjoying it, but undeniably grinning. Ted then talks about the herding instinct and how some border collies are born with it, and some are not. It is, he says, as simple as that:you want to herd sheep you are a sheepdog, andyou do not want to herd sheep, then you are not a sheepdog.It occurs to me than that perhaps this is what it is to be Scottish too: an instinct. Andyou feel that instinct,the skirl of the pipes stirs your blood, you are Scottish. We are, by heritage and by choice, an inclusive people, so it seems fitting that being Scottish should not be much to do with being born in Scotland or having Scottish parents or even ancestors, and perhaps not even much to do with ever having lived there. Maybe being Scottish is a choice, and one that all the bekilted Calornians wandering around Scotsfestival today have got right.Now the sun begins to set, bathing the RMS Queen Mary in golden light. Children battle their siblings with plastic claymores, the Scotch Egg concession posts a sign saying Everything Sold Completely Out and the implausibly good-looking sheep are loaded on to their tractor trailer. On a stage, the singer of a folk-rock band talks about how he and the Queen Mary were both born in Glasgow but have somehow washed up here together, and then he launches into the Skye Boat Song.It initially draws a loud cheer from the crowd, but they are quickly transported in to a reverie, and so am I. I am thinking of long-ago childhood holidays, trying to spot dolphins off the CalMac ferry and a peat fire in a drafty cottage in Lamlash. They, presumably, are mostly thinking about Claire Randall, because the Skye Boat song also happens to be the theme music for Outlander. Skye no more, then, and yet it does not matter: the song was anyway written a century after the events it claims to depict, and the lyrics were subsequently rewritten by Robert Louis Stevenson before being altered to better fit Claire Randallrsquos story. Here again, though, their version of being Scottish is just as good and as valid as mine, and perhaps more so, because it is even more inclusive. Whorsquos like us  Everybody that wants to be. We are, after all, all Jock Tamsonrsquos bairns.Set My Heart to Five, by Simon Stephenson, is out now on th Estate.

Philip Glass Concerto Pour Violon Deuxiegraveme is, purely coincidentally and rather atmospherically, playing on Spoty right now.This is not a Cold War, Berlin,  handover but Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow, . It works perfectly, therersquos no queue, no fuss, no panic, no sign of any other customers. The pick-up goes completely smoothly, too, apart from the rather Glasgow response to the question of whether there are instructions on how to heat the food: put it in the oven. Or the microwave. Hmm. This will cause head-scratching later as packages are opened, bags peered into it and questions asked about what are the salads and what are the mains.Scribbled on a single lid is the exhortation: fry. It will turn out the detailed instructions were in an attachment to the confirmation email but seduced as we already are by the engaging spirit-of-the-blitz order notes that have accompanied food from other restaurants and pop-ups recently nobody thinks of looking on there. Drsquouh.There is little sign either of that new hallmark of premium-priced lockdown delivery food: the Apple-style unboxing experience. Usually involving paper, cardboard, hand-crumpled tinfoil, tactile textures. Instead we flip lids on standard Chinese restaurant-style takeaway containers, set out clear-plastic dishes containing sauces and put aside the prawn crackersand get to work.Itrsquos really not dficult this heating up your own food. Whatrsquos more dficult is working out days, maybe even weeks, in advance what yoursquore likely to want to eat.

Itrsquos still pleasant. Smashed cucumbers we explore next, the smashing with a rolling pin taking place before the chopping and these are draped in a spicy peanutty dressing that sets fire to the mouth for a millisecond before the soothing and cooling cucumber gets to work. This gets us talking, or initially gasping.We like the chana dal, gingery undertones, pops of mustard seeds and also the freshly tart Malaysian karabu fine noodle salad with its crunchy toasted coconut, lime juice, fish sauce and palm sugar flavours. Though it works much, much better in the non-veggie version possibly because of that rich and mellowing fish sauce.A Malaysian nonya chicken curry provokes laughter mainly because the chicken it contains, thigh, comes in such a small portionthat itrsquos nothing more than a passing sensation.

He then fails to make the connection between lack of these scarce resources with \"draconian laws to enforce an ill-advised blanket lockdown\". The lockdown followed the scarcity as night follows day.There is no mention in the professors letter of the elephant in the room, which may well have been peeking over his shoulder as he wrote. The complete lack of preparedness within the NHS and the private care home sector to handle a surge of infections was the driver for the lockdown. The question which must be answered is why we were so badly prepared, and the answer is staring us in the face, or perhaps even standing beside us in the room  years of Westminster-driven austerity left the NHS so stretched that our resources in every area, PPE to ventilators, were lacking, that is why \"the draconian laws\" to enforce lockdown were required.At least Prof Ennos eventually comes to a cogent solution, and I make no apologies for quoting him: \"The time has come for the Scottish Government to admit past mistakes, pluck up its courage and lead us out of this grotesque lockdown so that we can live in a Scotland where risk is present but pragmatically managed, and our economy, education, culture and inidualism can thrive.\"Quite so.

Aside from the index case who brought the virus to the conference, anyone exposed on the th or th of February would be expected, therefore, to exhibit symptoms at the earliest around March and, at the latest, about March . Most likely, many cases were presenting somewhere in between, so it is highly likely that, as early as March  , only a suspicion of an outbreak could have been forming, given most cases would have developed later. Maybe the early contacts were colleagues who had journeyed to the conference with the index case and who, thus, were exposed earlier.

The population occupies breeding grounds eastwards from Scandinavia towards Siberia.The dotterel is unusual in that it turns the tables on traditional gender roles. The brightly-coloured females lead in courtship before leaving the smaller, drabber males to incubate the eggs and raise the young, and for this reason the species has been counted by the number of breeding males rather than pairs. There are only about - breeding males in the Uk.A new study published by Global Change Biology explores the potential ways that changing environmental conditions may be driving the decline and has found limited evidence that the decline in breeding is driven by climate change of dotterels.It research focuses on snow cover and nitrogen deposition. The amount of snow-cover is important for cold-adapted species of plants and animals.Fewer snow patches, around which dotterel feed, may lead to a reduction in peak insect abundance for chicks and cause unsuitable higher vegetation.Higher deposition of nitrogen tends to result in a reduction of alpine specialist plants, including species of mosses that form key breeding habitats for dotterel.Population declines and site abandonment by dotterel in Scotland during the last three decades have largely occurred at lower elevations, suggesting climate change may be the cause.However, the new study found relatively limited evidence that the decline in the breeding population is being driven by climatic factors on the breeding grounds, despite it previously being mooted as the primary reason.\"Climate change and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition are widely regarded as important drivers of environmental change in alpine habitats. However, due to the dficulties working in high-elevation mountain systems, the impacts of these drivers on alpine breeding species have rarely been investigated,\" the study said.\"The Eurasian dotterelis a migratory wader, which has been the subject of uniquely long-term and spatially widespread monitoring effort in Scotland, where it breeds in alpine areas in dwindling numbers.\"Here we analyse data sets spanning three decades, to investigate whether key potential drivers of environmental change in Scottish mountainshave contributed to the population decline of dotterel.\"We also consider the role of rainfall on the species wintering grounds in North Africa.The study said: \"We found dotterel declines in both density and site occupancy of breeding males primarily occurred on low and intermediate elevation sites.\"High-elevation sites mostly continued to be occupied, but males occurred at lower densities in years following snow-rich winters, suggesting high-elevation snow cover displaced dotterel to lower sites.\"Wintering ground rainfall was positively associated with densities of breeding males two springs later.\"Dotterel densities were reduced at low and intermediate sites where nitrogen deposition was greatest, but not at high-elevation sites.\"While climatic factors explained iation in breeding density between years, they did not seem to explain the species uphill retreat and decline.ldquoWe cannot rule out the possibility that dotterel have increasingly settled on higher sites previously unavailable due to extensive snow cover, while changes

But Andrea Balbi, the head of the association representing the cityrsquos  gondoliers, said the rules so far will not permit them to help tourists on and off the rocky boats.The extended hand is not just a courtesy, Mr Balbi said, but a condition of insurance coverage.Arrigo Cipriani, the owner of Harryrsquos Bar, said he is not even thinking about opening the canal-side bar made famous by Ernest Hemingway until health restrictions are relaxed.His bar offers some of the best people-watching in Venice ndash but it is just ft by ft, which under current rules would allow only a fraction of the usual clientele.Mayor Mr Brugnaro is hoping to send a signal of recovery by staging the popular Redeemerrsquos festival in July. The annual event celebrates the end of the plague in  ndash one of the most disastrous episodes in Venetian history ndash with a regatta and a spectacular fireworks display.ldquoIt will be something out of this world to see, he said, ldquowatching from a boat in St Markrsquos Basin."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-clubcard-vouchers-set-expire-extended-november-2020","story":"The extension comes as Tesco say customers across the UK have not been shopping as frequently as before the lockdown period began in March.Herersquos everything you need to know.Changing shopping habitsWith some customers unable to visit stores at all during lockdown, and others visiting less frequently, shopping habits have changed over the past few months.Tesco has reported that visits to the supermarket have halved since lockdown, but basket sizes have doubled.Clubcard vouchers extendedHowever, those with Clubcard vouchers could now be struggling to spend them before they expire,they cannot get to a store or book a delivery slot.Tesco has therefore issued a statement to shoppers stating that Clubcard points that were due to expire this month will now be extended, Manchester Evening News reports.Zoe Evans, of Tescos customer engagement centre, said:\"We appreciate that, for many reasons, most of us arenrsquot shopping as often as we did before lockdown.\"As a little help from Clubcard, we want to give you more time to use your vouchers which were due to expire on May , .\"Any vouchers issued in May  will now not expire until November , , giving you an extra six months to use them.\"Well update the expiry date on your digital vouchers, and well continue to accept paper vouchers in-store until the extended expiry date.

This includes the establishment of a joint ministerial committee to discuss the ongoing pandemic and its management.A statement, released this afternoon, Thursday, on behalf of Alistair Carmichael MP and Lord Jim Wallace of Tankerness said: “Across the country, people are worried about their loved ones and their jobs in light of coronavirus – and they are getting mixed messages from governments.”In a time of crisis, confusion and inconsistency breed fear and put people at risk. A collective approach could help to restore public confidence that our leaders are pulling together.This is not about dropping blame at anyone’s door. The reality however is that in recent days and weeks, attempts to formulate responses to the coronavirus are more notable for apparent disagreements between national governments than for policy substance. We need governments to build consensus and create a shared responsibility across the UK.”We are calling for a more joined up response to what is a cross-governmental challenge – by establishing a coronavirus Joint Ministerial Committee “A coronavirus JMC with an enhanced remit, meeting regularly and with an approach based on consensus and shared responsibility would help to reduce disputes, with all governments involved in developing plans.”It would help to refocus coronavirus response based on national and regional needs rather than political borders. This solution could help reduce the chaos of the current political climate – and point the way towards a better long-term crisis response mechanism in future.”We believe that an enhanced JMC for the coronavirus crisis is the right way to give people confidence in their governments during this time – with a message that leaders are working with, rather than against each other.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He said: “We are very disappointed that we have been unable to carry out a public event in Hoy.#The previous event that we held in Hoy, and indeed public events we have held where in Orkney during the project, have been very beneficial in meeting with the public to talk about Orkney’s Community Wind Farm Project.“The emergency legislation passed by the Scottish Government is vital in keeping projects on track to support our future economic and societal recovery, businesses and jobs and avoiding delays to infrastructure and other developments.“It’s really important to us that members of the public are offered the best opportunity possible under the current circumstances to make their views known about the plans so that we can consider this before we submit our application.#We have worked hard to develop a consultation plan which gives as much flexibility as possible to allow folk to provide that input and are hopeful for a high level of participation.”The council intends to submit a planning application later this year.The project is part of a project which also includes proposed wind farm developments at Quanterness and on Faray in the North Isles.The development will consist of up to six turbines with a maximum blade-tip height of .m, access tracks, crane hardstandings, turbine foundations, underground cabling, on-site substation and maintenance building, a temporary construction compound, potential excavations borrow workings and a permanent meteorological mast.The objective of the PAC is for communities to be better informed about major and national development proposals and to have an opportunity to contribute their views before a formal planning application is submitted to the planning authority.It should be noted that comments made to OIC through this PAC process are not representations to the planning authority. If a planning application is subsequently submitted, neighbour notication and publicity will be undertaken, and iniduals and communities will have an opportunity to make representations on that application to the planning authority at that time.To discuss options for speaking to the project team please contact Kirsty Groundwater, Project Officer, Orkney Islands Council by email on kirsty.groundwater@orkney.gov.uk or by phone on . The deadline for submitting comments to the project team is Monday, June , at pm.Comments can be submitted through:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England.

Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that.

The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million.

An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

As the attention ed to the main news, the reporter laughed in recognition. “Oh I know it very well, I used to go to the discos there,” she explained. That level of cultural reach does not happen overnight, nor without a huge effort from volunteers within the club. Current chairperson, Sean McGuigan, was on the committee when the disco began in  and said running the disco was a huge undertaking. “You really had to put your le on hold, because on a Friday night you couldn’t go anywhere,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “You had to go up the road to the hall. You could have had  or more people there. Evenyou didn’t go, you felt a bit guilty in case something happened and you weren’t there. “I can laugh about it now, but it was a very busy time. You were away out about half ,  o’clock and you wouldn’t have got back ‘til nearly  or  o’clock in the morning.”  Keen to enlist parental support in south Derry and beyond, the club pulled out all the stops, placing bouncers on the bus and manning the hall with vigilance. googletag.cmd.push The plan, on the whole, was a success and reams of teenagers packed the buses every Friday night to make the journey to Emmet Park. “I think parents knew that their weans were being bussed to the disco and home again,” said Sean. “There was no drink allowed on the bus, we took it off them before they got on. Parents bought into that, that they were being looked after when they came to Slaughtneil, which they were. “We had a fella Hugh Convery, God rest him. Standing on the floor he was ft  or so, maybe more. Once he stood up on to the brown chairs, people came in, saw big Hugh and they never moved!”  Securing reliable transport for the hundreds of young people who attended Slaughtneil was crucial to its success, which surprised many of the club’s members. “We met the bus people and went with the bus to certain towns,” said Sean. “I remember one night I saw the lights of the bus showing a sign for Donemana and I said to John Joe Kearney ‘Jesus John Joe, we’re a long way from home’. “Henry Kearney used to have to go out some Saturday mornings to Bobby McLaughlin or some of the bus men to keep them quiet!” On some occasions, Monday night committee meetings were taken up entirely by the business of organising the following Friday’s disco. In the late s and early s, two groups of boisterous young men from dferent parts of south Derry were causing the club a few headaches. “There used to be a couple of gangs from south Derry,” recalled Sean. “One was called the Banana Gang and they were from Bellaghy. The other was the Gorilla Gang and they were from Draperstown or Ballinascreen. “Those two gangs’ names would have been mentioned at our meetings every Monday night! The main part of the meeting was always about the disco and who was on on Friday night. “There was the odd wee scrap, and we had to throw the odd boy out for misbehaving, but when you think back now, they weren’t doing a wile lot of harm. “I remember when I was going to dances around Ardboe and the Castle and places like that and there were riots, really bad fights. There was never anything like that at our disco.”  The club’s coffers were rapidly expanding with every passing week, but, as the saying goes,you’re standing still, you’re moving backwards, and the disco had to evolve. That evolution wasn’t just focused on what was happening on the stage or in the hall. “We had to stamp them,” said Sean. “I remember children coming in saying they were paying for three people, throwing the fiver in, and not even waiting for their change. “I had to go to Donegal Pass to meet a fella to buy all these stampers, but the youngsters were getting the stamp and going back out and stamping all their friends when it was still wet! “We learned a lot. We stopped letting the children out until a certain time from the hall to stop it. “They used to try and spice it up too. Some nights they would have a foam party, or give out free Walkmans – they were pound a piece back then! Other nights, breakdancers came and danced through the hall.”  Having done a twenty-year stretch, and resulted in several marriages, the disco finally began to peter out in the mid-s. Attendances fell as teenagers’ choices of entertainment became more erse, and the club eventually pulled the plug. Sean McGuigan says the club can look back on that period with pride as an era in which their collective shoulder was firmly to the wheel. “You actually couldn’t do it now. There were some nights in there that the hall was jammed,” he said. “I’m not sure what took over, I saw some nights where there were only  in the hall. Everyone’s batteries got flat and then they stopped it. “A lot of us were glad it was all over, because it was hectic, but it made us a lot of money. It was only a pound in, which is pittance, but it was that big a crowd. “You were taking in around pound a week and on big nights, you could have got pound,. “There was a fair wee bit of pride went into it because the only time the price went up was for a late night. “At the meetings, people used to discuss raising the price, but the attitude was ‘we’re not going to destroy the goose that laid the golden egg’.” The teenagers of  move in a dferent era to those that went before them, who are probably glad that the walls of Slaughtneil hall are mute. “You actually couldn’t do it now,” said Sean. He’s probably right.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

To get ahead of them, you need to be quick off the mark.This weekend will see theof their soccer leagues behind closed doors, marking a conclusion to the sporting lock-down due to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic.With nine games to go, a win for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday would see them cut the margin at the top to a single point by the time leaders Bayern Munich kick off in Berlin on Sunday afternoon.The decision comes after the government gave the green light to games going ahead in mid-May and approximately , tests were carried out on the players, coaches and support staff from all  clubs in the top two leagues at the end of April.The German league website reported a second wave of testing, around the , mark, has flagged up two positive cases which will be monitored.The countrys leader Chancellor Angela Merkel is highly-qualied and holds a doctorate for her thesis on quantum chemistry. She is happy the country has achieved the goal of slowing down the spread of the virus.She handed the responsibility to the organisers of the league and they have put a special sports medicine and match operations task force in place to managed the move back to competitive sport.Tier two club Dynamo Dresden has since put their squad and management team in isoaltion for two weeks after two players tested positive for coronavirus. The rest of the leagues will go ahead.If only we had locked down as quickly in this part of the world. Thank God for local communities and for the GAA, who acted swty to lead people once Leo Varadkar signalled the need to act in early May.The Taoiseach was naiumlve during his appearance on the Late, Late Show to hint at the chance for the All-Ireland championships to be played this year.It is dficult to see how, but the GAA leadership has since issued the statement confirming that there will be no inter-county action until October and club activities wont begin before mid-July,they even do.It leaves uncertainty surrounding the chance of playing games behind closed doors, which is not ruled out, but anyto action – club or county – is subject to public health guidance. googletag.cmd.push SAFETY FIRST When I think back to club month in April last year, there is nothing I would like better than ato action. Laveys clash with Swatragh ending in a draw, Foreglen and Claudy going down to the last seconds and Banaghers clash with Dungiven decided by a point. It would make you jealous thinking about it.Everybody knows how tight the calendar is and that there will only be room for county or club,there is a . But not both.With all players essentially club players and the chosen few on county , it is only fair the GAA cater for everyone and scrap the county scene. It may seem like the nuclear option and an extreme one, but the hierarchy would get huge respect for making such a dficult decision. This reinforces how well clubs rallied around those in need. It was the GAA at its very best.I would feel for Derry hurlers though, who were in a terric situation to eventually get out of Division B. So maybe the GAA could finish out the few games involving the relegation and promotion, so that it is an even keel when  comes around the corner.Deep down and with a realistic hat on, I cant see much being played. The safety of a nation is just far too important. We are not Germany. They got off to a better start, with stronger leadership coming from the top.I just hope the GAA dont force teams to play behind closed doors. It is not an option. There is some dference between Bayern Munichs Robert Lewandowski and say... Derrys Karl McKaigue.Big Lewandowski, now that all the players are tested, can be kept in exile from his family. Professionals can stay in hotels and there is money there to fund that.McKaigue is a physiotherapist and potentially working on the front line. How can he possibly stay in isolation. Are the GPA going to be able to pay himhe stays at home  I wouldnt think so and Derry will not be able to pay him to stay in separate accommodation between games.As regards testing. A GAA player could be tested on a Monday to seehe is able to train and pick up the virus after that. His test could come back clear and he could infect the rest of the  and the opposition come the following Sunday.It just isnt feasible. If it is not safe for supporters to attend games, then players are the same.Watching the Bundesliga this weekend should be a reminder to decision makers of how a country can benefit from acting early and in a calculated manner.Us sporting addicts, we will just have to keep watching it on television. When the time comes to , it needs to be the right time...not just a rushed job. We deserve as much. googletag.cmd.push RELATED - Irish rugby tour postponed. More...

To get ahead of them, you need to be quick off the mark.This weekend will see theof their soccer leagues behind closed doors, marking a conclusion to the sporting lock-down due to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic.With nine games to go, a win for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday would see them cut the margin at the top to a single point by the time leaders Bayern Munich kick off in Berlin on Sunday afternoon.The decision comes after the government gave the green light to games going ahead in mid-May and approximately , tests were carried out on the players, coaches and support staff from all  clubs in the top two leagues at the end of April.The German league website reported a second wave of testing, around the , mark, has flagged up two positive cases which will be monitored.The countrys leader Chancellor Angela Merkel is highly-qualied and holds a doctorate for her thesis on quantum chemistry. She is happy the country has achieved the goal of slowing down the spread of the virus.She handed the responsibility to the organisers of the league and they have put a special sports medicine and match operations task force in place to managed the move back to competitive sport.Tier two club Dynamo Dresden has since put their squad and management team in isoaltion for two weeks after two players tested positive for coronavirus. The rest of the leagues will go ahead.If only we had locked down as quickly in this part of the world. Thank God for local communities and for the GAA, who acted swty to lead people once Leo Varadkar signalled the need to act in early May.The Taoiseach was naiumlve during his appearance on the Late, Late Show to hint at the chance for the All-Ireland championships to be played this year.It is dficult to see how, but the GAA leadership has since issued the statement confirming that there will be no inter-county action until October and club activities wont begin before mid-July,they even do.It leaves uncertainty surrounding the chance of playing games behind closed doors, which is not ruled out, but anyto action – club or county – is subject to public health guidance. googletag.cmd.push SAFETY FIRST When I think back to club month in April last year, there is nothing I would like better than ato action. Laveys clash with Swatragh ending in a draw, Foreglen and Claudy going down to the last seconds and Banaghers clash with Dungiven decided by a point. It would make you jealous thinking about it.Everybody knows how tight the calendar is and that there will only be room for county or club,there is a . But not both.With all players essentially club players and the chosen few on county , it is only fair the GAA cater for everyone and scrap the county scene. It may seem like the nuclear option and an extreme one, but the hierarchy would get huge respect for making such a dficult decision. This reinforces how well clubs rallied around those in need. It was the GAA at its very best.I would feel for Derry hurlers though, who were in a terric situation to eventually get out of Division B. So maybe the GAA could finish out the few games involving the relegation and promotion, so that it is an even keel when  comes around the corner.Deep down and with a realistic hat on, I cant see much being played. The safety of a nation is just far too important. We are not Germany. They got off to a better start, with stronger leadership coming from the top.I just hope the GAA dont force teams to play behind closed doors. It is not an option. There is some dference between Bayern Munichs Robert Lewandowski and say... Derrys Karl McKaigue.Big Lewandowski, now that all the players are tested, can be kept in exile from his family. Professionals can stay in hotels and there is money there to fund that.McKaigue is a physiotherapist and potentially working on the front line. How can he possibly stay in isolation. Are the GPA going to be able to pay himhe stays at home  I wouldnt think so and Derry will not be able to pay him to stay in separate accommodation between games.As regards testing. A GAA player could be tested on a Monday to seehe is able to train and pick up the virus after that. His test could come back clear and he could infect the rest of the  and the opposition come the following Sunday.It just isnt feasible. If it is not safe for supporters to attend games, then players are the same.Watching the Bundesliga this weekend should be a reminder to decision makers of how a country can benefit from acting early and in a calculated manner.Us sporting addicts, we will just have to keep watching it on television. When the time comes to , it needs to be the right time...not just a rushed job. We deserve as much. googletag.cmd.push RELATED - Irish rugby tour postponed. More...

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

It was announced yesterday that fishing will be allowed as part of the easing of the lockdown restrictions. Glenowen Fisheries, which is based within Creggan Country Park, will be among the local facilities to re-open next. A spokesperson for the fisheries stressed that people would need to pre-book and pre-pay before arriving at the facility. Fisheries Minister Edwin Poots has confirmed that the Public Angling Estatewill gradually re-open to local anglers from Monday. Thirty PAE’s across Northern Ireland will re-open to the public for recreational use, but anglers should only use the DAERA facilities within their local area and should not travel long distances. Minister Poots also confirmed that car parking facilities will remain closed until  May . googletag.cmd.push Speaking about the announcement, the Minister said:“In the interests of public health, I shut down the angling estate on  March, to discourage unnecessary journeys and protect my staff as well as anglers themselves, given that the majority are in the + age bracket and many have concessionary angling licences due to underlying health issues. “While car parks will remain closed until  May to discourage long journeys, I have decided to permit local anglers back on to the Public Angling Estate so that they can participate in their favourite recreational activity. “By its nature, angling is a solo sport or hobby, and its participants can enjoy a day’s fishing without being in close contact with others. The sport has huge benefits for people’s mental and physical well-being and in this time of uncertainty, I know that many people have missed the solitude and peace that angling and being outdoors with nature, brings them. googletag.cmd.push “However, let me be clear – anglers must continue to follow social distancing guidelines, practice good hand hygiene and walk to their nearest PAE, fishing alone or with a member of their own household. I do not want to see crowds of people near the river banks and fisheries.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

Second was Ballymoney farrier John Mawhinneyrsquos Motalee, ridden by Denis Macauley who in later years bred Brave Inca. Strahane Last took third ahead of False Modesy, ridden by Ballygowanrsquos I Kerr for Tom Kerr.This was double success for Lisburn vet-surgeon Robert Steele, as he had earlier won the second race of the day, the R E Hamilton Hunter Chase Championship Qualier, value pound, on Eurowin. Second was Meadow Hawk, ridden by William Gault, from Randalstown, with Downpatrickrsquos painter Kieran McLoughin third on the Leo McGrady-owned Le Bambino.Irsquom not sure where I watched all the races, but I do recall that I went to the second fence on the course to watch the final race, the Ashley Bar Mares Maiden Race. In those days the fence was an open ditch and permanent.The leader going into the fence was Miss Alex, trained by Victor Robinson at Portadown and ridden by Tom Howley. The six year old never lted, firing her rider onto the ground, and in the process brought down Colin McBratney on More Cloud. Somehow the other  runners avoided Howley as the race progressed.The eventual winner was Bonnetys Bridge, a rare ride and a sole career win for Don Ferris from Poyntzpass, Newry, who is now the father-in-law of top local amateur Mark OrsquoHare. Second past the post was Dalaray, owned by Banbridge farmer Robert Mulligan and the mount of Ian Buchanan, who was a dentist in those days. Third was Staboe Lady, ridden by her owner, M CampbellThe meeting was run under the stewardship of Craig Caven and Mrs Doreen Johnston. The hon secretary was Ballydrainrsquos Jim Pooler, while his son, Chris, was the announcer. The clerks of the course were Denis Macauley and Tom Edgar and among the honorary surgeons was Mr Alan Archbold from Seaforde. In those days Billy Cromie from Clough was well known as the board marker.Among the advertisers were Charles Keown, Renault dealer Royal Ascot Roadhouse, Carryduff Seaforde Transport CJ Foy MPS, Irish Street, Downpatrick The Old Tom Bar, Castlewellan Watt and McBriar Ltd, Saintfield Abbey Grill, Downpatrick and Irwinrsquos Superfoods, Ballynahinch.Following on from the only career wins of Lavery and Ferris, it is interesting to record that in  Craig Caven, Ardglass farmer and long time master of the East Downs, was able to achieve a long held ambition to ride in a point-to-point when partnering Nightmasterrsquo, a course specialist owned and trained by John Macauley, in the opening Alan Dunlop Confined Hunt Race.It was a very wet and windy day mdash only eight of the  entries took part mdash but Craig won from ldquoTullumgrange, bred and owned by Ardglass farmer Dick McConvey, and ridden by Darragh Cross rider Paul McMahon. Red Gazette, owned by Frances Haw from Ballynahinch, came third.Felix Burns, who is now over , from Rossglass, had a runner in the race called Bright Spree VI.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area. The scheme has the potential to create new hotel and retail development, creating jobs and boosting the economy.ldquoThe project is people-driven and providing facilities for them. It is also vital that was is created is used all-year-round, not just during the traditional tourism season. The focus is also in on making the most of the natural environment that we have in Newcastle and the surrounding area.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said that the Belfast Region City Deal represents a major investment.He said in the Newry, Mourne and Down area, the investment proposals focus on the Mournes Gateway project and several schemes in the Newry area, including a city centre regeneration project, new theatre and conference facility and southern relief road.ldquoFunding is also being made available for digital infrastructure enhancements and enhanced skills and employability provision across the region, said the spokesman.He said the vision from the City Deal investment was to deliver inclusive growth, deliver up to , more jobs and increase the value of goods and services produced in the area by poundm annually..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Going.jpg","title":"Newcastle man’s extraordinary job post at the South Pole  ","story":"IMAGINE looking out of your kitchen window and seeing a humpback whale idly swimming by, or a small team of seals at play in the water.Therersquos snow and ice everywhere, animals outnumber humans, noise is completely muted but yet you have never felt more alive or connected to the world.Thatrsquos the extraordinary experience Newcastle man Kit Adams enjoyed when he took up a job offer which saw him as postmaster at the Port Lockroy research station on Goudier Island.Itrsquos located off the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, more commonly known as the South Pole, and is one of the most remote places in the world.The  year-old mountaineer lived and worked with a small team of people over four months in what has become an important heritage site and a tourist destination for people who want to see the thriving penguin community.Employed by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, Kit handled the postcards sent by hundreds of holidaymakers on Antarctic cruises who visit the island and claim to have set foot on earthrsquos most southerly point.Back at his familyrsquos home in Newcastle, Kit has had time to reflect on what the experience meant to him.ldquoThe one thing that became clear to me is that itrsquos the type of environment that I want to spend more time in, said Kit, who coped with freezing temperatures of up to minus seven degrees fahrenheit.ldquoIt really affirmed what I thought I wanted to do, and thatrsquos spending more time in the polar regions. Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside. It was just ridiculous but absolutely wonderful at the same time.Spending Christmas at Port Lockroy was also special to Kit and the team as they had the pleasure of a day off and a chance of seeing the tiny island from a dferent perspective.Kit said: ldquoThere was a cruise ship nearby who kindly offered us a couple of kayaks. We manged to kayak around the island on Christmas day which was a great experience.While hersquos happy to be home with his family mdash dad Colin, mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps mdash Antarctica still has its hold over Kit.ldquoSimply being there is something that I do miss but the people I was there with were truly wonderful and I got on fantastically well with them, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange being with them for so long and then everyone just goes their separate ways.ldquoEverything is up in the air at the moment but I really would love to go back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

Whatever measures the government have put in place ndash and they were very quick to take action and order a lockdown and introduce testing ndash they seem to have worked.Gareth said they were concerned like everyone  about the outbreak, but reckoned that they would put themselves at more risk taking a flight home.He said: ldquoOnce all this happened, we did have the conversation with our families about whether or not we should go home, but to be honest, regarding all the news headlines that we have been reading about home and the rest of the UK, we weighed everything up and it seemed that the situation was much worse in the UK and Ireland.ldquoAs we were able to still continue with our jobs, it seemed staying was the best and safest solution for us.The Australian government, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Prime Minister Boris Johnston, this week announced plans to phase down current lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks and months.

He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews.

However, over the past few weeks clarityhas been provided by Ministers through a set of guidelines which it is suggested, should be address prior to any formal decision to reopen being made.As such council officers have proposed an initialoperating model to see the borough’s four main sitesreopen.The report states that services at these premises would be availableto the general public on weekdays from am to pm.A Saturday morning slot would,these recommendation are approved by Council, be available only for health care and associated workers.It is also suggested that initiallywaste is limited to black bag and potentially green waste and that only cars are to be permitted.The need to limit the reopening to the four main recycling initially, is, the report claims, “based on a mix of waste product capacity and maximising the use of key staff ”.The report concludes by stating that the implementation of this model is dependant on Council’s abilityto redeploy staff and on the speed at which waste operators could get their service operational, ensuring that the vehicles are road worthy.Given these considerations the report suggests it may take up to five working days from a decision being made to the actual reopening of the four sites.This issue is due to be debated at tonight’s virtual council meeting.The meeting is set to get underway at .pm and members of the public can watch the debate by clicking hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

However in the following days, we work to open the other five sites shortly afterwards.”Addressing the issue SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon asked that this matter be dealt with under scheme of delegation in order to ensure that recycling centres can be opened promptly.He also asked that Council’s bulky waste collection service be “restarted in tandem” with the reopening of recycling centres and queriedhow recycling centres could cater for those who are shielding.His comments were address by Council’s ChiefExecutive, Roger Wilson, who said party group leaders had made their “desire to get centres open as quickly as possible” clear.He also said it would be a “matter of practicality”the decision were to remain under delegationas this would “remove the element of having to go through a call in period”.Council’s Strategic Director, Mark Parkinson, said he would agree with Councillor O’Hanlon “on the point about bulky waste collection restarting at the same time” as recycling centres reopen.Ulster Unionist Party councillor, Julie Flaherty, commendedthe “fantastic job” waste men and women are doing across the borough and said her party would support steps to reopen these centres quickly and safely.The Alliance Party’s Cllr Eoin Tennyson asked about PPE for staff and was informed by Mr Parkinson that the council has a sufficient supply of PPE.The Director also informed Cllr Tennyson that Council is meeting with unions “every morning” to make sure “the equipment is reaching the right people” and the supply of this equipment is “reviewed on a regular basis”.Councillor Darryn Causby welcomed the fact Council can now “get these centres open” and asked what type of material would be accepted at that start.He was informed by Mr Parkinson that in line with the initialproposal the sites will accept “black bags and general waste until processors are back up and running” and that “over a period of time, we will expand the waste cycle”.Independent Councillor Paul Berry called for a “common sense approach” to allowing certain trailers access to recycling centres.“Some areas across this borough, do not have a brown bin for their garden waste and I think their needs to be a common sense approach towards letting some trailers with garden waste have access to these sites,” said Cllr Berry.Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell, agreed with this point. However, the Council’s Strategic Director explained that restricting sites to cars and black bags only is an attempt to deal with an expected initialpeak in demand.“We will get a vast number of people looking to bring black bags and access the centres,” said Mr Parkinson. “We are limiting it to cars initiallyto manage capacity. Once we are over that peak, and we expect that to be within a few days, we can look at allowing access to trailers and white vans.“In regards to smaller sites, the other thing to consider is their size,we get the demand we expect, we will be forced to close them again very very quickly as they will be at capacity.”DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said he was concernedthatsmaller sites were not opened quickly, residents in those areas could feel “short changed”.His party colleague Alderman Gareth Wilson, said this issue was one the general public are “engaged with” and are aware that it is a service that can be offeredwith “social distancing kept in place”.He also said Council needs to be very careful about getting the message across about what type of material can be accepted at these centres.This view was agreed with by DUP Alderman Paul Rankin who said thatany announcementwas to be made, Council would need to “give a timeframe or specydetails on when the other five sites are going to open”.SDLP Councillor Thomas Larkham enquired about the openingtimes for the four main centres and was told they would open from Monday – Friday am to pm, initially, in line with the report presented to members.It was also made clear, following a query from SDLP Councillor Eamon McNeil, that a special time slot for NHS and other care staff would be in operation on Saturday mornings from am to  noon.DUP Councillor Margaret Tinsley then asked that Saturday opening hours be extended to allow all those back at work to access to the sites.An announcementon the issue is expected from Council tonight , following a party group leaders’ meeting where the issues raised during the debate will be discussed.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "}]
