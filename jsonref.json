It puts 500 jobs at risk.The Duchess of Cambridge’s favourite high street brand is now working with Ernst \u0026amp Young to help decide the \u0027best way through\u0027 the upcoming \u0027difficult and unstable times.\u0027Its undoing was blamed by commentators on high prices and a failure to compete well enough with rivals offering same or next day delivery services. The move comes after LK Bennett reported losses of £5.9 million in 20162017, compared with a £100,000 profit in the previous 12 months. LK Bennett\u0027s founder, Linda Bennett emailed staff today about the intention to file for administration. She thanked staff for their \u0027hard work and dedication\u0027 and added that she didn\u0027t regret returning to the brand in 2017 to try and \u0027reinvigorate\u0027 the label.LK Bennett is the latest in a line of big  names to become causalities in the bloodbath on the high street. The UK\u0027s largest toy shop Toys R Us went into administration in February 2018, leading to an estimated 2,000 redundancies and Marks and Spencer announced plans last  May to close 100 stores by 2022.  The British brand opened in 1990 and is now well known for its signature kitten heels favoured by celebrities and royals including Kate Middleton who is pictured wearing dresses from the brand during a tour of Australia in 2014Fashion brand Orla Kiely, which was also loved by the Duchess of Cambridge, also went out of business with debts of more than £7.25m (€8.1m) last year. High Street clothing giant Gap also announced today that it will close 230 stores worldwide as its US parent company launches a massive restructuring programme.The closures amount to nearly a fifth of its total shops although the company has not said where stores will shut or how many jobs will be affected.           Shoppers have said the brand put prices up after Kate Middleton started wearing their clothes          LK Bennett is the latest big name to become a casualty in the bloodbath on the high street          The Sludge wedge increased by £20 after it became popular with Kate Middleton          LK Bennett\u0027s Natalie clutch bag also increased in price by £20 in 2012Both of these items saw their price increase by £20 after the royal was snapped in public with them.  Branding expert Claire Shiels told Femail how labels can struggle to keep up with demand  after  public figures wear their clothes.She said: \u0027A sudden and unexpected spike in sales and demand\u0027 can \u0027involve huge costs for the label.\u0027                                                    However customers have said the store \u0027put their prices up\u0027 after Kate started being seen wearing their clothes and got engaged to Prince William.Others have also criticised the brand\u0027s prices, saying \u0027that not many people have £300 spare to buy one dress\u0027.  Branding expert Claire Shiels told Femail: \u0027Celebrity endorsement is the holy grail for any retailer, although it can bring with it as many problems as benefits.\u0027Having your high street label worn in public by one of the world\u0027s most photographed women can prove to be a nightmare if you\u0027re not forewarned, which is usually the case with Kate Middleton.Ms Shiels added: \u0027The problem for labels with Kate in particular, is that she chooses staple wardrobe items that are typically priced at the higher end for high street retailers and wears them more than once.\u0027This means that typically, her fashion followers will only purchase one item per season, rather than buying into the brand and shopping with them all year long.\u0027Fashion commentator Karine Laudort also told MailOnline: \u0027The Duchess of Cambridge may be a fan but the everyday woman in Britain may think twice before spending an extra £100 on a outfit, \u0027Especially when most online retailers now offer free 24-hour or same day delivery.\u0027 Today the brand was running an offer for 25 per cent off the entire new season range online and in store.Customers could also enjoy free UK delivery on all orders. Items  in the new range that were eligible for the discount included colourful court shoes priced at £195, a gold envelope clutch bag costing £175 and a variety of midi dresses costing around £300.  LK Bennett is well known for its signature kitten heels favoured by celebrities such as Holly Willoughby and royals including Kate Middleton.Kate took a two year hiatus from the brand and wasn\u0027t spotted wearing it on any public occasions after August 2016. But she reaffirmed her love for it, just a few months ago – wearing a green and cream silk polka dot dress for a visit to the Evelina London Children\u0027s hospital, in December 2018.           Kate, pictured at Kings Cross St Pancras station in London, also chose a teal suit from the brand for her first official engagement with the Queen in March 2012  Holly Willoughby, left in one of the brand\u0027s dresses at the Chelsea Flower Show in May and Katherine Jenkins, right in the Izzy dress and Priyanka Courts at her album signing in London in December, are also among the famous fans of the fashion label          Linda Bennett, pictured at Buckingham Palace, received an OBE for services to the fashion industry in the New Year Honours list in 2016Kate also chose a teal suit from the brand for her first official engagement with the Queen during her Diamond Jubilee UK Tour in 2012. This elegant look included the £395 Jude jacket and £225 Davina dress which she paired with a pillbox hat by James Lock. High Street clothing giant Gap to close 230 stores worldwide...The curse of Kate!

Linda Bennett, pictured, came back to the company in 2017 after leaving in 2008 when she sold her majority stake  for between £80m and 100mBennett founded the brand 29 years ago in 1990 with a store in Wimbledon, London. The brand grew quickly into an international chain and Bennett decided to sell the business to Phoenix Equity Partners and Sirius Equity in 2008 for around £80-100million.Despite having sold off the brand she retained a stake on the company board, before re-joining in 2017 as a consultant to the management team.In September 2017 Bennett increased her investment in the company and bought out the remaining equity from private equity owner Phoenix Equity Partners and at the time the brand was operating more than 260 shops and concessions in more than 30 countries.After the acquisition by Bennett the company stated that it would continue to expand and subsequently launched stores in China, Russia and the US.  The curse of Kate!

The high street store is set to file for administration\u0027Retailers must walk a fine line between supply and demand, with production based on a number of factors including historical sales figures, market trends and buyer behaviour. \u0027A sudden and unexpected spike in sales and demand, which is what happens to a garment when the Duchess is spotted wearing it, often means that another immediate production run is required to satisfy demand and maximise the sales opportunity. \u0027Unfortunately, this can involve huge costs for the label, which then is unable to forecast when the sales surge is likely to suddenly drop again. \u0027The science behind production is therefore thrown into disarray and costs can easily spiral.\u0027 The Duchess, 37, has been spotted wearing L.K. Bennett numerous times - from a printed blue and white dress to her go-to black booties.Claire added: \u0027The problem for labels with Kate in particular, is that she chooses staple wardrobe items that are typically priced at the higher end for high street retailers and wears them more than once. \u0027This means that typically, her fashion followers will only purchase one item per season, rather than buying into the brand and shopping with them all year long.           The Duchess of Cambridge sporting an LK Bennett dress for a dinner at Kensington Palace, London, during former US President Barack Obama\u0027s state visit to Britain in 2016          Kate, 37, wore a white and blue floral L.K.Bennett dress during a visit to Luton with national charity Youthscape in August 2016\u0027Despite the financial woes currently experienced by some of her favourite labels however, it is the market – not Kate - that is to blame for the mass closure of many high street stores. \u0027As well as L.K.Bennett Hobbs, Orla Kiely, Alice Temperley and Issa have all experienced significant financial difficulties.\u0027Although it\u0027s a difficult time for retail, Claire claims some lower-priced brands including Zara and Primark have got it right.She said: \u0027Zara is in the enviable position to have been able to bring its manufacturing process in-house rather than outsourcing abroad, meaning costs are reduced and the brand is able to react quickly to a sudden increase in demand. \u0027At the other end of the scale, Primark is continuing to thrive due, it is said to its mass market appeal and its focus on engagement with its customers through social media.\u0027It is the stores which are best able to adapt and have a supply chain flexible enough to cope with fluctuating demand and market trends which will survive.

We\u0027re on the precipice of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil again for the first time since the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011,\u0027 said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. The only thing keeping Ripley company was a soft plush toy version of planet Earth - which demonstrated when the rocket reached zero gravity.Elated Musk shared a video of the toy floating in space on his Twitter shortly after the successful launch.As the rocket took off, NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken looked on.The pair could strap into another Dragon capsule as early as July for the second space demo.           Pictured: Sigourney Weaver as Ripley in Alien (1979)It\u0027s been eight years since Hurley and three other astronauts flew the last space shuttle mission, and human launches from Florida ceased.NASA turned to private companies, SpaceX and Boeing, and has provided them $8 billion to build and operate crew capsules to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. Now Russian rockets are the only way to get astronauts to the 250-mile-high outpost. Soyuz tickets have skyrocketed over the years - NASA currently pays $82million per seat.Boeing aims to conduct the first test flight of its Starliner capsule in April, with astronauts on board possibly in August.An estimated 5,000 NASA and contractor employees, tourists and journalists gathered in the wee hours at Kennedy Space Center with the SpaceX launch team, as the Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from the same spot where Apollo moon rockets and space shuttles once soared.Bridenstine said he\u0027s confident that astronauts will soar on a Dragon or Starliner - or both - by year\u0027s end. But he stressed there\u0027s no rush.          SpaceX founder Elon Musk gave a post-launch news conference this morning after the test flight successfully took off          The capsule\u0027s only passenger was a test dummy (pictured), named Ripley after the lead character in the Alien movies          This latest, flashiest Dragon is on a fast track to reach the space station on Sunday morning, just 27 hours after liftoff           NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken could strap in as early as July if this test flight goes well   Pictured: the Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket, ready for launch, sits on pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, yesterday\u0027We are not in a space race,\u0027 he said. \u0027That race is over. We went to the moon and we won. It\u0027s done. Now we\u0027re in a position where we can take our time and make sure we get it right.\u0027 The white crew Dragon is slightly bigger than cargo versions - 27 feet (8 meters) tip to tip - and considerably fancier and safer.It features four seats, three windows, touch-screen computer displays and life-support equipment, as well as eight abort engines to pull the capsule to safety in the event of a launch emergency. Solar cells are mounted on the spacecraft for electrical power, as opposed to the protruding solar wings on cargo Dragons.\u0027It\u0027s an incredibly sleek looking vehicle from the inside and it\u0027s very easy to operate,\u0027 Hurley told reporters just hours before liftoff. He said he marvels at how the Dragon has just 30 buttons and touch screens, compared with the space shuttle cockpit\u0027s 2,000 switches and circuit breakers.For the test, the Ripley dummy was strapped into the far left seat, wearing the company\u0027s snappy white spacesuit. The other seats were empty, save for a small plush toy resembling Earth that was free to float once reaching zero-gravity. \u0027Super high tech zero-g indicator added just before launch!\u0027 Musk tweeted.SpaceX already has made 16 trips to the space station using cargo Dragons - but this capsule is slightly bigger than those at  27 feet (8 meters) tip to tip, and considerably fancier and safer          The Dragon capsule features four seats, three windows, touch-screen computer displays and life-support equipment, as well as eight abort engines to pull the capsule to safety in the event of a launch emergencyAs many as seven astronauts could squeeze in, although four will be the norm once flights get going, allowing for a little cargo room. About 450 pounds (200 kilograms) of supplies are going up on this flight.The capsule is designed to dock and undock automatically with the space station. Cargo Dragon must be maneuvered with the station\u0027s robot arm.Like Ripley, the capsule is rigged with sensors. Engineers will be carefully watching sound, vibration and other stresses on the spacecraft, while monitoring the life-support, communication and propulsion systems. Some of the equipment needs more work - possibly even redesign - before serving human passengers.\u0027We\u0027re going to learn a ton from this mission,\u0027 said NASA\u0027s commercial crew program manager, Kathy Lueders.Flight operations team members - some of them new to this - also need the six-day trial run, according to Kennedy Space Center\u0027s director, Robert Cabana.The objective is to make the next demo flight, with Hurley and Behnken, as safe as possible. The more immediate goal is to avoid harming the space station and its three occupants: an American, Canadian and Russian.Despite SpaceX\u0027s success at recovering and reusing its rockets, NASA is insisting on brand new boosters from SpaceX for the crew capsule flights. The first-stage booster used Saturday aimed for a floating platform in the Atlantic, following the predawn liftoff. SpaceX plans to recycle the newly flying capsule for a high-altitude abort test this spring, along with a booster launched and retrieved a week ago.

Me Before You by Jojo Moyes (pictured above) ranked 6.8 She said: \u0027Our readability formula looks at how long words are, how complex sentences are – it can\u0027t do any more than that. Then you\u0027ve got to take into consideration the length of the book and equally important is the interest level.\u0027Looking at Steinbeck\u0027s low difficulty rating she said that its clear that a young child would be able to read the book, but that they may not be able to understand the meaning.\u0027It doesn\u0027t take into account the literary devices used, the underlying meanings … It is just, literally, can you read the words?\u0027Despite this, Renaissance determined that The Grapes of Wrath would still be of interest to readers aged 14 and above as would Of Mice and Men.This is while Dahl\u0027s The Magic Finger is appropriate for five- to eight-year-olds, and Mr Greedy for lower years as well.A spokesperson for Renaissance said: \u0027We do like to stress that ATOS book levels are not the only measures of the suitability of a given book for a particular student.\u0027No scientific formula can take into consideration the maturity of the themes addressed or the sophistication of the literary devices employed by the author of a book.

If there is a vote on the 12th and it takes two months to carry out the procedure, it would be justified.\u0027Mrs May has said that if her deal is rejected by Parliament, MPs will be able to vote on whether the UK can leave the EU in a no-deal scenario, and if that is rejected, the Commons can decide on whether to extend Article 50 and delay Brexit for a limited period.Today the leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt issued a joint warning to the Prime Minister over colleagues they believe are poised to delay or block Article 50 altogether.The pair write in the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027The active pursuit of a delay to Brexit - with no purpose beyond frustration - is a betrayal of the referendum result.\u0027They say this would be an \u0027irretrievable breach of trust\u0027 to those who voted Brexit but also warned against the ruptures that would be caused by a no-deal. How Cox\u0027s \u0027codpiece\u0027 might save the day and allow PM\u0027s...PM\u0027s war on \u0027death cult\u0027 Tories: Vote down Brexit deal again...Share this articleThe news comes as Mr Barnier said Brussels was ready to give further \u0027guarantees, assurances and clarifications\u0027 that the Irish backstop should only be temporary.The backstop has been a sticking point for Brexiteers who see it as undermining the very sovereignty the UK stands to gain through leaving the EU. Mr Barnier insisted that the controversial measure, intended to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, will not be removed from the Withdrawal Agreement.While acknowledging Brexiteer concerns that the backstop is a trap that would keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, Mr Barnier insisted it is only \u0027insurance\u0027 intended for the \u0027worst-case scenario\u0027.Speaking to German newspaper Die Welt, Mr Barnier said: \u0027We know that there are misgivings in Britain that the backstop could keep Britain forever connected to the EU.\u0027This is not the case.

The men were paid £48 million overall – or 13 times the amount paid to women. On average, women earned £232,687 compared with £1.14 million for men.Experts said the pay gap could be explained by the fact that most of the women on bank boards are non-executive directors. That means they are not responsible for day-to-day operations.Non-executive roles tend to be part time and typically involve advising on board matters rather than executing strategies.Banks have boosted the number of women non-executives to make their boardrooms more erse.

Then there was the venue, a small hall in Derik, in the north-eastern corner of war-torn Syria.Bizarrely, Friday\u0027s audience of 70 was made up of about two dozen uniformed foreign fighters with a Kurdish militia, along with five middle-aged women, some excited teenagers and a few curious families with children.           British singer Joss Stone, barefoot as usual, walked on stage and greeted the crowd, she began one of the strangest concerts everTo cap it all, Stone was accompanied by photographer Paul Conroy, sneaking back into the country for the first time since he was wounded in the 2012 Syrian rocket strike that killed war reporter Marie Colvin – as seen in the hit film A Private War.Stone, 31, who is on her Total World Tour and aiming to play in every country on the planet, said: \u0027It was very different – we have played 174 countries and that was unique.

Surely, I thought, it must be a coincidence? And yet the timing felt troubling.Could it be possible that our phones are somehow eavesdropping on our conversations – and that key phrases are being logged and used to send us targeted adverts? The implications, if true, are chilling.           Ad for glasses... After talking about eyesightWe are obsessed with our phones. They accompany us to our most personal spaces – our homes, our bedrooms and bathrooms – are privy to our most intimate of conversations and are used for all aspects of our business, personal and financial lives.But what I discovered over several days of investigation reveals what can only be described as a frightening new chapter in our relationship with these devices.To me, there is no doubt: the microphones on our phones are indeed listening to our everyday lives.We do not even have to be using our phones to make a call for them to eavesdrop. Unless the microphone is disabled, they appear to be able to pick up words and phrases and translate them into related adverts which then appear in apps such as Instagram and Facebook.If I hadn’t observed this insidious behaviour for myself, I wouldn’t have believed it was possible.Facebook, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, completely denies using microphones to eavesdrop on conversations, or to tailor adverts. They insist they only show adverts based on user’s interests and information they voluntarily upload. How then can they explain what I uncovered in this investigation?          Facebook, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, completely denies using microphones to eavesdrop on conversations, or to tailor advertsI carried my iPhone with me at all times over the course of a week. It was always switched on and close enough to me for it to be able to ‘hear’ any conversations. One day, I visited my GP for an NHS check-up, and she booked me for a blood test. By the time I was back with the nurse to take my blood, I had received an offer on Facebook from private firm Thriva offering me a ‘blood test today’.From there, I met a friend for lunch. I’d decided to purposely discuss obscure subjects so that my previous internet search history wouldn’t interfere with any new ads.          If you have an iPhone, you will also need to turn off the Siri applicationTo do so, go into your Settings, scroll down to ‘Siri and Search’ and switch off the tab that says ‘Allow Siri when locked’.If you want to keep your social-media apps, you can visit each one in Settings and switch off the ‘Microphone’ tab.Alternatively, if you have an Android phone, navigate to Settings and disable or turn off the microphone, and also disable ‘Okay Google’, which allows the phone to react to voice commands.                                                    The following day, my Instagram was full of dozens of Italian adverts, including one for an exhibition, another for a singer’s new album and various Italian holiday offers.But that wasn’t the full extent of my phone’s espionage. It was also, I discovered, spying on my pictures.A friend sent me a picture on WhatsApp of a £1,190 Chloe Nile leather cross-body bag that she had seen in Selfridges. I had never Googled or looked up the bag myself. It was too expensive for me, so I replied: ‘I wonder if we could find a replica.’Days later, a similar bag popped up in an advert on my phone, priced at a far more realistic £39.99. Surely not another coincidence?WhatsApp would say so. They insist your messages are so encrypted that even they can’t tell you what you’ve been sending.A little research threw up a similar case of an American woman called Jen Lewis, who in 2017 posted a picture of herself on Twitter wearing a pink shirt and blue jeans.She was subsequently targeted on Facebook by a lingerie company, which sent her an ad of a model wearing an almost identical outfit.She wrote in a post to her page: ‘Uh, Facebook just served me a bra ad where a woman is wearing the outfit that I’m currently wearing.’It went viral, with 21,400 ‘likes’ from people around the world. Facebook insisted it was coincidence, but thousands of people were unconvinced, suggesting that the woman’s phone or laptop camera was targeted with image-recognition software.Of course, the questionable habits of social-media giants in harvesting our personal data is nothing new.Most people will already know that, when they use a search engine or visit certain websites, they can expect to be targeted by related adverts in their internet browser.But the idea that our conversations, and photographs are being collected is a different prospect entirely.          This time, I got ads on both my Facebook and Instagram accounts from airlines AND photography companiesI got in touch with Dr Vitor Jesus, senior lecturer in cyber-security and privacy at Birmingham University. ‘I’m not surprised by the sequence of events you experienced,’ he told me.‘Every time you download an app and give it permission to access personal information, whether it be photographs, contacts or microphone, you open yourself to being targeted. The companies tell us they do this, but the information is buried in long agreements and policies that most of us don’t bother to read. So I say, buyer beware!          Ads in Italian... After listening to Italian radio‘There is no such thing as a free app. And at the moment, because users are technically giving permission, it is not illegal.’This ‘permission’ is tacitly given because the microphones on most people’s phones are always left on. The phones are pre-programmed to listen for ‘trigger’ phrases which activate personal assistant apps such as Siri or Alexa. This means that many other apps could be using the same technology without the phone owner’s knowledge.Dr Jesus said: ‘It is entirely possible to have multiple apps listening in the background all the time, with each being triggered by keywords.‘Your details are then passed on to the relevant companies who will bombard you with adverts.’The precise way this works is still something of a mystery – even to experts – because it depends on which app is listening in. But it is thought that app developers create a list of keywords relating to its advertisers or their products.The microphone sends conversations through transcription software which instantly turns it from speech to text.If key words or phrases are present, the app triggers adverts to be sent to users.Paolo Sartori, managing director of cyber-security firm TransWorldCom, believes companies such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp have all developed algorithms that allow this process to work effectively.           Ad for a copycat bag... After getting a photo of the real thing‘We conducted our own mini-test in the office a few months back, and it was certainly an eye-opener,’ he said. ‘We used phrases around razors and lady shaving. That evening, one of our staff was bombarded with ads on Facebook for shaving products. She was the only one with Facebook on her phone everyone else had removed it.’Mr Sartori warned that this is one way free apps could make money – by selling data about their users to advertisers. He said: ‘It would explain how these social-media platforms are able to come up with adverts after we have spoken.’But if our private lives are being used for advertising, what else is being monitored? Interestingly, none of the experts believe the social media companies are acting with malicious intent.At the moment, we have no way of knowing for sure. And it is worrying to realise just how easily we may have opened ourselves up to being exploited for profit.David Emm, principal security researcher at international cyber-security firm Kaspersky Lab, offered reassurance.He said that there is not someone listening to our every word and that it is not possible for a device to determine who said what – just that the word or phrase was used by someone within earshot of the phone.But he warned: ‘People should think more about what they download on their phones and remember that nothing is free. There are just different ways of paying.’Of course, our phones are not the only devices with microphones or built-in cameras. Our other ‘smart’ household devices – designed to make modern life more efficient – may have a darker side, too.From TVs and Alexa assistants to baby monitors, fridges and smart meters, reports have shown that such gadgets have the ability to record people without their permission.I decided to ask Siri, the personal assistant app on my phone, outright whether he (or she) was listening to my conversations.‘Hey Siri,’ I say.‘I’m here,’ it replies.‘Have you been listening to my conversations?’ I ask.‘I’m not sure I understand,’ Siri replies, defensively.‘Have you been spying on me?’ Siri knows what to say – almost as if it had been pre-programmed: ‘Nope. Are you sure you haven’t been spying on me?’It has all the hallmarks of a modern spy thriller – only this one feels rather too real for comfort. "},{"url":null,"title":"Beloved green used families council chiefs want turn car park","story":"    Hands off our green: Campaigners are fighting to stop the popular park in Loughton, Essex from being built onHeartbroken elderly couple are forced to watch as their...US millionaire boldly goes for new £130m classic car museum...For cod\u0027s sake, not another chippy!

I was confident that my Cleethorpes constituency would vote to leave and they duly delivered by 70 per cent to 30.When I arrived in Westminster nine years ago I joined the European Research Group (ERG) and have consistently voted first to achieve a referendum and subsequently to deliver the most robust version of Brexit possible.My vision for Brexit was spelled out almost exactly by the Prime Minister in her Lancaster House speech where she outlined the following objectives: taking back control of our own laws, control of our borders, and the ability to sign new trade deals around the world.Unfortunately we are now a long way from that vision. The Withdrawal Agreement put to Parliament on 15th January was, as we know, not just defeated but slaughtered by a majority of 230, and yet, bizarre though it may seem, it remains the only deal on the table.The main concern for most MPs centres round the Irish backstop which could lead to Northern Ireland staying in the EU Customs Union, large parts of the single market and governed by EU VAT rules. The backstop could be used by the EU to achieve further concessions from the UK surrounding such areas as access to fishing waters or in relation to Gibraltar.Corbyn attacks First World War commemorations as a \u0027piece of...Woe Jeremy Corbyn: 100 MPs could join Tom Watson\u0027s army as...Share this articleWe should not be afraid to leave without a deal, something confirmed by senior businessmen and women when I attended a dinner arranged by the Hull \u0026amp Humber Chamber of Commerce last Thursday evening.They recognised there were potential problems but could also see opportunities, even without a deal. What a pity so many members of the Government have been silent when it comes to articulating an optimistic vision for a post-Brexit Britain.So where are we now? We are faced with what I trust will be a carefully-crafted, legally binding addition to the Prime Minister’s deal. Labour have already betrayed millions of their voters. We Conservatives must not do the same. Those of us who are passionate Brexiteers must now decide how we ensure we leave, and leave we must on March 29, for if we don’t the Government’s credibility will be in tatters.The Remainers in Parliament have undermined our negotiating position at every opportunity.          Mr Vickers said: \u0027Sadly, I cannot see how we can achieve Brexit other than by supporting a revised version of the PM’s deal\u0027Of course ‘no deal’ should remain on the table, but the PM has been forced to put that to a parliamentary vote if she fails to get a deal through and it’s almost certain parliament will vote to further weaken our negotiating position. So much for honouring the referendum result.Sadly, I cannot see how we can achieve Brexit other than by supporting a revised version of the PM’s deal as described above.If we can reach a compromise on the backstop we have to accept the reality that this is the best we can get otherwise we could end up in a deal that prevents us from implementing trade deals, having to keep free movement or, perish the thought, remaining an EU member.If the Prime Minister can achieve this, then I believe she will find that the majority of the Commons will support her deal. No deal is better than a bad deal, and a revised version of Mrs May’s deal is better than no Brexit at all. Martin Vickers is MP for Cleethorpes and a member of the party’s European Research Group. "},{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghan hire traditional nanny birth child","story":"Hiring a nanny: That is the long-term plan by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as Kate, Duchess of Cambridge has done for all her three childrenThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex plan to hire a traditional nanny after the birth of their first child, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.Informed sources dismissed speculation that Meghan will recruit a doula, a non-medical assistant who provides support during pregnancy and the early days of motherhood, or opt for a New Age-style birth.And they say reports that Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland will move permanently to Britain from America to help bring up the child are also wide of the mark.Instead, the couple plan to be hands-on parents, and will bring in a nanny later this year ahead of a rumoured royal tour. The approach mirrors that adopted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their children, George, five, Charlotte, three, and Louis, ten months.They later appointed Maria Borrallo, a graduate of the prestigious Norland College, when George was a few months old, although it is understood that Meghan may bring in a nanny when her child is younger than that.Last night Norland College declined to say if they had been approached by the couple.It is understood that Harry and Meghan have been ‘listening to advice from friends’ including George Clooney’s wife Amal, who had twins in June 2017, and fashion stylist Jessica Mulroney, who has three children.          It is understood that Harry and Meghan have been ‘listening to advice from friends’ including George Clooney’s wife Amal, who had twins in June 2017, and fashion stylist Jessica Mulroney, who has three childrenWhile Meghan will take formal maternity leave and is unlikely to attend public engagements, she is determined to remain active behind the scenes working for her various causes. But a source said: ‘This is her first baby and there will be a certain degree of playing it by ear.’In January, Meghan became patron of the National Theatre, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the animal welfare charity Mayhew and Smart Works, which helps women get jobs.She will this week join a panel including singer Annie Lennox and former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to mark International Women’s Day, where they will discus issues such as ‘access to education and limitations in employment’.Meanwhile, builders have been working feverishly to complete the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage in Home Park, Windsor. Harry and Meghan hope to move to the Grade II listed property from Kensington Palace within the next three weeks.The move may mean that Meghan chooses not to give birth at the Lindo Wing, the exclusive maternity ward at St Mary’s Hospital in Central London where the Duchess of Cambridge had her three children, but instead use a hospital ‘closer to home’.One option would be Frimley Park Hospital in Berkshire, which is about 15 miles from Windsor and where the Countess of Wessex had her children. It comes amid reports Meghan and Harry are considering raising their child \u0027gender neutral\u0027 – understood to mean they will not enforce any male or female stereotypes.        Gender neutral:  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are said to be looking at bring up their child without gender stereotypes According to a source, who has known the Duchess for many years and was at her wedding: \u0027Meghan has been talking to some of her friends about the birth and how she and Harry plan to raise their baby.\u0027She said they plan to raise their child with a fluid approach to gender and they won\u0027t be imposing any stereotypes.\u0027The most likely scenario is that the couple could choose to forgo traditional blues and pinks to match the baby\u0027s gender. They could also avoid conventional gender-biased toys such as dolls for girls and train sets for boys.Last night a senior Kensington Palace aide refused to rule out the possibility of the baby being raised gender neutral.       Gone with traditional: Meghan pictured meeting youngsters on a recent trip to Morocco will do away with blue and pink colour schemes and would not wish them to be surrounded with conventional toys            Keeping quiet: Kensington Palace have refused to comment on plans to bring up the baby gender fluid The couple are understood to have chosen neutral grey and white hues for the nursery, rather than the blue or pink.Meghan has transformed her husband in many ways: Harry has given up alcohol in solidarity with his pregnant wife, quit smoking and recently revealed he starts the day by meditating.

For the first 10 years of her life, her home was a battlefield in the brutal war between the neighbouring states. She spent many childhood nights in an air-raid shelter and she looked on as the place that was all she knew was reduced to rubble. Dashti’s work has always focused on the legacy of conflict, a fallout that continues around Ahvaz both physically – the rivers are poisoned, the wheat fields barren – and psychologically.From her earliest work a decade ago, Dashti has approached this post-conflict history not as a documentary photographer, but as a conceptual artist. She grew sick, she has said, of foreign photojournalism – women in chadors brandishing machine guns. Instead, she wanted to use her pictures to locate the more intractable insecurity that she recognised all around her. She started staging pictures that juxtaposed the expectations of normal life events – celebrations of weddings or birthdays – with the ever-present detritus of war.In the series of pictures she called Stateless, made in 2014 and 2015, she developed this idea with surreal portraits in the Iranian desert. The pictures were intended as metaphors of her country’s ongoing trauma for the million Iranian lives lost in the conflict, but also those millions more who have been displaced in the region’s subsequent wars – Iran has accepted more than 950,000 refugees in recent years, mostly from Afghanistan. This picture – a couple clinging to each other with all their worldly goods exposed under the hot sun – is emblematic of that latter reality: “Sky becomes the ceiling and mountains the walls of their new home,” Dashti says, “because nature is the only place that shelters these people, an everlasting refuge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b2cd7ce579057766e0e0365a5f0d443313c74c/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1300\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=081ff9c0444f096cc2a674a12f8d8a9b 2600w","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Kim Jong-un’s summit with Donald Trump in Vietnam, demonstrations at the border between Colombia and Venezuela, and Paris fashion week – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ffcb2b7951831b4b9ab89d84d2e832da93e8a6d/0_226_3390_2034/master/3390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cf9091a5abaa219bf619271e77063fb","title":"archbishop says dont be too quick to judge pell but parishioners struggle with faith","story":"As churches around Australia celebrate their first Sunday mass since Pell’s conviction, many parishioners say they are feeling angry and betrayedDespite saying he could not comment “too much” on the conviction of Cardinal George Pell for child sexual abuse, with the matter filed for appeal, the archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, nonetheless urged parishioners not to be “too quick to judge” the disgraced prelate.“If we are too quick to judge we can end up joining the demonisers or the apologists, those baying for blood or those in denial,” he said as he delivered Sunday mass at St Mary’s cathedral. “Our readings remind us that things are not always what they seem that we must look beneath the surface and allow truth and justice to unfold in God’s good time.”Pell, the one-time financial controller of the Vatican and confidant to Pope Francis,was found guilty of one count of sexual penetration of a child and four counts of an indecent act with a child. Many Catholics have been left reeling since the news broke on Tuesday and feeling torn as they attended mass around the country.“It would have been reasonable to stay at home,” Father Andrew Hayes told congregants as he presided over mass at St Mary’s parish in Ararat, a small town 200km west of Melbourne.“I am also ashamed and embarrassed.”Ararat is less than 100km from Ballarat, where Pell was born and later became a parish priest. The towns of Ararat and Ballarat have for decades been grappling with the impact of the notorious paedophile priests who once wreaked harm there. While the Vatican and prominent Australian Catholics have avoided making comment on Pell’s guilt, saying they are awaiting the appeal process, Hayes told parishioners: “The church shouldn’t look like an angry bull, to be stared down. The church should look like Jesus.”Hayes was upfront in confronting the imprisonment of Pell. “This week as we begin mass our Cardinal is in jail, having been found guilty of disgraceful offences against children,” Hayes said.“I am so sorry for what this church has done to you. I am sorry for the abuse by clergy, the lifetimes of torment and the loss of life.”His words may have been of some comfort to Catholics who are victims of abuse, who know people who are, and who are struggling to reconcile their faith with the historical and ongoing failures of the church and its hierarchy to children.Alison Page is one such parishioner who was hurting in the wake of the Pell scandal. She describes herself as a cultural Catholic. She attended mass in a Sydney diocese on Sunday, she said, “very reluctantly and still feeling somewhat nauseous”.“I only attended as I was rostered to take children’s liturgy,” she told  Australia. “I am also a lawyer and child protection investigator having done a lot of work in this area. I feel appalled personally and professionally by what I have learned this week about the Pell case.“Particularly as this will continue to ide opinions until the appeal is heard.”The parish priest addressed the issue in his sermon, she said, noting the church had made mistakes and now needed to focus on and pray for victims. But Page said she had long been sceptical of the church hierarchy and felt it had failed to deal with abuse so far in a way that addressed “the gut-wrenching disappointment, sadness and anger of many of the congregation”.She would continue to attend mass, she said, for family and community reasons.“I am a believer in the teachings of the Gospel and my relationship with God is deeply personal – I have never let the Church’s doctrines interfere with this relationship,” she said. “However, I am not a blind devotee to the church hierarchy and power structure – for this reason, have never been confirmed – I don’t think this makes me any less of a Christian.”Like Page, she told Sky News on Sunday that she had long lost faith in the Catholic church as an institution.“How am I supposed to trust that an institution that has so grotesquely failed to protect children, that has so grotesquely failed to do as Jesus commanded, you know, love the little children and bring them in and care for them, where is God in all of this?,” she said.“Where is God’s mercy, where is God’s love? And where is the church responding to this crisis, as God would ask us to – with mercy, with humility, begging forgiveness, and with real contrition and a resolution to change?“I am not alone in this, there are many Catholics I speak to who really struggle with that, with going to mass, and feeling just angry and betrayed while they’re there, about where their institution is.”In Canberra, associate professor Dominic O’Sullivan plans to attend Sunday evening mass at St Michael’s in Kaleen. He said he felt “deeply sad” for victims, and that needed to be the focus going forward.“People take that very seriously, and there’s also perhaps a view that people would like for the allegations to be untrue. That perhaps explains the sympathy but doesn’t mean he is innocent or that he has been the subject of a witch hunt. One has to distinguish between what one would want to be true and what is true.”O’Sullivan said despite those sinners he would keep his faith, which he described as based on his relationship with God, not people.“The church is a community of sinners and people do depart from church values,” he said. “Pell’s an example of that. It’s very sad and it’s very distressing, but it’s no reason for me to stop believing in God.”Marten Koomen attended mass at the church where Pell, then the archbishop of Melbourne, abused two 13-year-old choirboys – St Patrick’s cathedral in Melbourne. Koomen says he is not a devout or institutional Catholic but says he finds great comfort in remembering his deceased aunty and parents, as well as friends, during the services.He said the archbishop of Melbourne, Peter Comensoli, did address child sexual abuse on Sunday in a sermon that was “full of contrition” and where attendance numbers did not to seem up or down.“Of course listening to him you don’t know whether he’s had media advice or if it comes from a genuine spiritual place, I am a bit sceptical,” he says. “I’m progressive and ultimately the law has to transcend the church. But he spoke about the shame of the church, and that was welcoming.”At St Joseph’s Catholic church in Brunswick West, Victoria, parishioners were reluctant to share their thoughts with  Australia as they entered the building for mass. “It makes no difference to me,” one man said of Pell’s conviction.Another parishioner, who did not wish to be named, said she had read “everything” about Pell’s conviction including the many pieces supporting him and claiming he was wrongfully convicted. She said commentators should leave the case to the legal system.“I’m shocked at the events,” she said. “I think as a church we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us, and our work now is to care for the victims.”She said she was coping with the scandal and maintaining her faith by focusing on her relationship with God.“If you have a strong faith and follow the message of Jesus Christ, then you just keep on focusing on that despite the struggles.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1bdae5cd1ce3cf788429d38d53f2f6221be84e2/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd389641fb60b3573fe3c3960b55dc7","title":"sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras in pictures","story":"A selection of images from the 41st annual parade, the theme of which was ‘fearless’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cecdcf26a5fa83f4077b89a130dae9765d4943f/0_0_4811_2888/master/4811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1108184ce19b9b31a02989c2d06e5ad7","title":"john lewis brace for life little or no bonus partnership","story":"While some Brexiters seem desperate for Britons to recreate the camaraderie of the second world war years, do staff toiling in John Lewis and Waitrose stores really want to be transported back to the time of rationing? This week the employee-owned company’s 83,000 staff will find out the size of their annual bonus – and they have been warned that they may need a magnifying glass to see it.After a Christmas to forget, Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership (JLP), said times were so tough that the company would “need to consider carefully … whether payment of a bonus is prudent” – not least because of the proximity of the Brexit deadline, when the country’s retailers are braced for major disruption.Getting their bonus – which was first paid in 1920 and is handed to all staff from shelf stackers to senior managers – is usually a belated Christmas present for staff who, lest we forget, spend December slaving on shop floors and in cavernous warehouses to satisfy the nation’s gift-buying needs. The payout has not been withheld since the postwar economic downturn of 1953, when rationing was still in place, so suspending it would suggest the company is taking a dim view of prospects in Brexit Britain.Staff have got used to getting less cash in recent years, but would they revolt at the bonus disappearing altogether? There have already been critical letters from staff in the company’s in-house magazine, the Gazette, questioning the direction in which management is taking the group.But that is the emotional dimension. On a hardheaded financial basis, the company may be right to hoard cash after a tumultuous year that saw John Lewis department stores fall into the red in the first half. Not only that, but Waitrose is to break with its long-term delivery partner, Ocado, in 2020.Without question it has been one of the most volatile years in the group’s long history. High street names have fallen like dominoes, with rival House of Fraser only just surviving. Price-cutting has been rife at a time when shoppers are sitting on their hands as the Brexit row rages on.That’s before we even get to the reasons that big shops cost more to run these days, as rising business rates, staff costs and rent costs put pressure on a business model being tested to breaking point by Britons’ obsession with online shopping.The break with Ocado will leave a hole in the Waitrose business and its boss, Rob Collins, can expect plenty to deal with on that front. Are the 700,000 shoppers Ocado is promising to hand over to its new partner, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Waitrose diehards? Or are they fickle food shoppers happy to use the service whatever the name on the tin?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b38aa896f03a85d4648d92ccca635c669a4cf4f/0_0_4665_2799/master/4665.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbf1321d166d0c683ffa3e64fd644436","title":"a powerful argument for radical change readers respond to guardian concrete week","story":"From highlighting favourite Brutalist gems to suggesting construction alternatives, readers have had lots to say about our concrete coverageThis week  Cities has been investigating the contentious issue of concrete. While it has brought about improvements in public health and some celebrated works of architecture, the material is causing widespread destruction across the globe.As our coverage explored concrete’s different angles – its environmental impact, its influence on culture, the brutalist buildings under threat, and potential alternative materials – many of you joined in the debate.We were overwhelmed by your response, from photos of your favourite concrete beauties and detested monstrosities, to tales of how concrete has shaped your cities, such as this Instagram post from the Birmingham Civic Society about the legacy of its “concrete collar”.On Twitter there was an impassioned debate over whether the demolition of Birmingham’s old Central Library – a former brutalist landmark – was architectural vandalism or the right decision for the city.You also expressed alarm at the dangers that the production and use of concrete is posing to the planet, and several of you, inspired by Fiona Harvey’s report on alternatives to concrete, shared examples of more environmentally friendly materials and methods.Jonathan Watts, the ’s Environment editor, kicked off our Concrete Week with an in-depth report on the shocking impact of concrete on the planet. Here’s a selection of your many responses to his report:Fiona Harvey reported on the new alternatives to concrete being developed, such as cross-laminated timber. David Hopkins, managing director of the Timber Trade Federation, got in touch to reiterate the benefits of wood: “There are lots of advantages to building in timber – managed forests provide a range of environmental benefits, helping to produce oxygen, provide bioerse habitats and natural management of water, reducing flood risk. As a material that absorbs rather than emits carbon, timber continues to make a positive contribution to the environment after it is harvested, and has one of the smallest carbon footprints of any material used for building.”Other readers told us about other potential solutions we’d missed. Hemp – perhaps not commonly associated with the construction industry – has long been celebrated as an alternative building and insulation material. “Hempcrete” is made with a mix of hemp hurds, lime and water, and is used mainly for non-structural building materials and wall insulation. Once the plant is turned into hempcrete it continues to absorb CO2.Straw is another option. Straw Works, for example, manufactures pre-fabricated straw panels. The company says: “Load bearing walls are either built of load bearing straw bales, or timber frame infilled with straw.” As an alternative to concrete foundations it is also using car tyres for the new community hall by Holy Trinity Church in Tulse Hill, London.We also heard about Gnanli Landrou, a scientist and entrepreneur, who is developing a process to turn clay-based excavation material into a soil-based concrete, which doesn’t use cement – the key material that is most responsible for concrete’s shocking carbon footprint.You contacted us to tell us about cement companies that are attempting to make the production process less harmful to the environment. The manufacture of clinker is the most-energy intensive part of cement production, with half of concrete’s CO2 emissions created during this process. Dalmia Cement, Ambuja Cement and UltraTech Cement in India say they are trying to change the way they produce clinker, and are using recycled industrial waste. They use low-grade limestone, with fly ash (waste from thermal power plants) and slag (waste from the steel industry) in their blended cements.One reader on Twitter also said:Structural engineer Nawid Daoud, meanwhile, argued that – although he supports sustainable alternative materials – some elements of construction can’t be done using sustainable, commercially viable alternatives (yet). He says for certain components of buildings, concrete is still the most viable option both from a material strength perspective, and from a cost perspective.For example, the vast majority of building foundations are concrete, and you will struggle to find an alternative, more sustainable material which will perform in the same way as concrete does under intense compression, let alone one which is widely available (and therefore affordable).”You took to Instagram to post concrete-inspired photos, and wrote about your affection for certain concrete structures.Mark Cowan from UK Truckmixer Training got in touch to flag up the importance of training for drivers who deliver concrete. Cowan, who has worked as a concrete mixer driver for 28 years, says these vehicles are frequently subject to rollover incidents.… we received this photo of concrete hippos in Glenrothes, Fife.Thanks to all of you who submitted comments, emails, tweets, posts and images.

In 2017, we were all elected on a brilliant, radical manifesto, and as members of the largest left-of-centre party in Europe. We also need to be honest about the fact that Brexit has posed a serious challenge to the unity and political integrity of the Labour movement. That is why the shift we have seen from the Labour leadership towards backing a final say is so vital if we are to continue to inspire millions of people and deliver the social and economic agenda that we have promised.Brexit was always a Tory project, and this is the Tories’ mess. But our approach to Brexit cannot just be a question of competence or parliamentary footwork. It must be rooted in an understanding of what Brexit is really about - boosting nationalism, scrapping regulations and blaming immigrants for a social crisis which is really the result of rightwing economic policy. Brexit won’t just destroy jobs and harm the communities we represent it is also a crucial point of reference for the rise of the far right globally.If Labour had failed to stand up to this agenda, we would have faced ruin, with a demoralised activist and voter base. Now that we are backing a final say, we have a chance to turn these problems on their head. It is failed politics, where people across our communities have been ignored, that has created this ided society. With a different politics, we can return to the mass enthusiasm and people-powered politics that drove the Corbyn surge of 2015.To rise to this challenge, Labour will have to do far more than vote the right way. We must campaign wholeheartedly and with radical politics at the front of our case, as many trade unions already are. We will need the Labour movement to mobilise and fight for the right of the British people to have the final say, just as union members get to vote on the deals negotiated by their leadership.Labour is not arguing for a re-run of the 2016 referendum, but a ratification vote on a specific deal. As John McDonnell has said, Labour is now clear that Remain would be on the ballot paper. The campaign against Brexit needs to start now, and on positive terms which only Labour can deliver. On doorsteps and in communities, we need to launch an insurgent campaign which combines internationalism with a vision for transforming our economy and democracy, and putting power and wealth in the hands of the many, not the few.The EU reflects the political reality of the member states that comprise it, and is far from perfect. We deplore the treatment of Greece by the European institutions, and the fact that tens of thousands of migrants have been left to drown in the Mediterranean Sea. It is precisely because of these criticisms that our movement has a moral duty to stay and fight in the EU, working alongside the European left and using our position as the largest group in the Party of European Socialists. Jeremy Corbyn, and the mass movement underneath him, could yet be a major player in influencing the EU’s policies and development for the decades ahead.Unless we find a way to deliver a just transition to a sustainable economy, not only for Britain but for the entire planet, we face catastrophe. The EU provides a unique international framework to do this. A zero-carbon economy across Europe can go alongside a charter of trade union rights, a tax avoidance crackdown and a massive programme of redistribution, so that we level up rather than racing to the bottom. These are the policies that are required to combat the rise of the far right. We need to build unions, not borders.We share the frustration, and we understand the doubts, of many of our parliamentary colleagues. Labour has heard the cry from Brexit and we must heal the ide. No one would have chosen the situation we are now in. What comes next involves pain, and will require bravery. But we now have an opportunity to defeat Tory Brexit, bring down the government, and rebuild and transform Britain. We must seize it.

Any extension of the article 50 process should be for a reason. It should be to eliminate the blind Brexit Theresa May proposes. But first her deal must be defeated.The Brexiters will fall into line with her deal because they believe they can win the subsequent battle and impose a hard Brexit. The soft Brexit supporters and those who want a fresh referendum should unite to insist Britain knows the direction of its future relationship with Europe before we leave. We have learned a lot during this Brexit debacle. It has been a masterclass in political risk. We are now in a state of confusion, in which even those whose day job is to study the details find it hard to explain.The May deal is bad for one central reason. In the name of resolving the issue so we can move on, it does no such thing. The political declaration is deliberately vague. It is unclear if the framework for the future is hard Brexit, ie a Canada-style conventional free-trade agreement, or soft Brexit, ie a Norway-style arrangement that keeps us in the European trading system of the single market andor the customs union.The difference between the two is fundamental and at the heart of the whole Brexit debate. And they are – with some plus or minus – the only models on offer.The reason for the vagueness of the declaration is that when the PM tried to decide this issue, at Chequers, in favour of soft, it was clear enough for cabinet ministers to resign but insufficiently clear for Europe to accept. So she retreated.Today, the cabinet is split. One half want soft, the other hard. May’s strategy is to maintain ambiguity and essentially say to both sides: keep your powder dry and fight it out after we leave. When she says that an extension of the article 50 process doesn’t of itself resolve the central question, she is right. But neither does her deal. Instead, we are going to pay billions upfront, exit, lose our negotiating leverage and the fight will go on.We are told that this is the only deal on offer, when this is nonsense. Europe would be perfectly happy to amend the future declaration to point in the direction of hard or soft Brexit, should parliament decide it. Then, having decided the guiding principle, the detail would indeed be much easier.This was, after all, what we were promised continually by the PM until she realised she couldn’t do it without destroying what was left of the unity of the Conservative party. The obvious thing is to vote down her deal, vote down no deal, extend the time limit and reach an “in principle” conclusion on hard or soft if neither passes, go back to the people. Alternatively, accept her deal but with the Kyle-Wilson amendment for a confirmatory referendum before we implement it. The parameters of hard or soft are well known and a decision on the options could be done even within the timeframe of a short extension. This course is being refused because the PM knows that she would be forced to take a position – the cabinet will split and the Brexiters will wreak further havoc should parliament vote for soft Brexit.It is extraordinary to see how the once strutting Brexiters are so frit of putting their actual hard Brexit proposal to the vote either of parliament or the people before we leave. They fear, rightly, that when the implications of Britain moving to a Canada-style trade relationship with Europe are explicit, the country will recoil. Ultimately, the Brexiters’ strategy will be to get Britain out, remove May, elect a Brexiter to deliver a hard Brexit or possibly fight an election against a weakened Labour party to secure such a mandate. Those who want a soft Brexit, including Labour MPs who may be thinking of backing the deal, would be ill advised, unwittingly, to co-operate with this strategy.For those of us who want to put the matter back to the people, the route to such a decision is through the process of forcing a conclusion to the hard v soft question. Once obliged to choose, MPs will realise either choice is unattractive and the people will understand neither is better than what we have inside Europe now. MPs should think long before agreeing to exit blind. If I were an MP, I would not want to own this putrid potage of poor political leadership and self-destructive consequence.Any extension requires Europe’s agreement. It should agree, but with a condition. The extension should be for a purpose: clarity as to the future framework. That way, the next stage of negotiation will not be a repeat of the last. This is in Europe’s interests. And for sure it is essential to ours.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

These strange and knobbly vegetables, at their peak in winter and spring, take a little effort to prepare but the results are well worth itWe kept the parsnips over winter in a sack of sand in the outhouse, my dad sending me down to get the long, pale roots on a Sunday morning, so they could be peeled and roasted around the beef. I protested, even though they made a silky mash and a fine soup. We knew nothing of the other pale and interesting winter vegetables – salsify or Jerusalem artichokes, celeriac or kohlrabi – and had no any idea you could eat beetroot without pickling it first.It is odd, sad even, that we have settled for carrots and parsnips when there are so many other root vegetables worth our time. I guess we went for the easy-peel varieties. Salsify, long and elegant, is back in the shops after years in the wilderness. It’s a messy vegetable to deal with, possessing a fine, mineral flavour, that – unlike most of its kind – carries something of an affinity for shellfish. I use it with scallops and cod cheeks. The roots are the devil to wash, and covered in fine, black soil that will get everywhere. They need washing and peeling, though not necessarily in that order. Salsify can be cut into stubby pieces the length of a wine cork, and fried. Butter is its friend, but steam the pieces first then toss them in it, like new potatoes. Better still, after steaming, roll each lump in beaten egg and fresh breadcrumbs, perhaps with a little grated parmesan and chopped parsley. Then fry till crisp.Celeriac is finally having something of a moment. Once you have sliced off its tangle of roots and peeled it, you are left with snow-white flesh that tastes mildly of celery. It can be ushered into a soup with bacon and parsley. You can heroically clear all the stragglers from your veg box in one go by grating it into a crunchy salad with beetroot and kohlrabi. It needs a damn good dressing though. I toss it with a paste of black garlic then marry it with soured cream and crisp, hot pancetta.A word of advice: it is much easier to peel salsify before you wash it.Serves 2Peel the cucumber, cut in half and then in small dice no bigger than a centimetre. Put the cucumber in a small mixing bowl with the white vermouth, the wine vinegar and half a teaspoon of sea salt. Pull the tarragon leaves from their stems and stir into the cucumber then set aside for an hour. Longer will not hurt.Fill a saucepan with cold water then squeeze the lemon into it, adding in the empty lemon shells for good measure. (The more acid the water, the less chance of your salsify discolouring.) Peel and wash the salsify, then cut each root into pieces the length of a wine cork and drop into the cold water.Bring the pan to the boil, then lower the heat, salt lightly, cook the salsify for about 15 minutes, until tender, then drain.Roughly chop the parsley, then stir half of it into the cucumber pickle.Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan over a moderate heat then add the drained salsify and cook for a few minutes till lightly and evenly coloured on all sides. As soon as the salsify is golden, add the butter to the pan and let it melt, then, just as it starts to sizzle, pat the scallops dry with kitchen paper and lower them carefully into the pan. They may spit at you. Let the scallops cook for a minute or 2, then turn and cook the other side. As soon as the scallops are ready, lift them and the salsify on to plates. Spoon the cucumber pickle over them and serve. aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Do the same with the kohlrabi – or slice or shave it very thinly – then mix with the celeriac. Wash the beetroot, then spiralise and add to the other veg.For the dressing, crush the black garlic to a paste using a pestle and mortar, then pound in the egg yolks and a little salt. Add the oil, a few drips at first, mixing all the while, then, as it thickens, in a steady stream until you have a thick, mayonnaise-like cream. Stir in the soured cream and set aside.Cut the pancetta into lardons about 2cm thick.

He calls quantum physics his jam, and is a self-taught specialist in the chemical breakdown of food substances by micro-organisms.As the head of fermentation at Noma, Zilber, 33, coaxes new flavors out of jars whose contents are bubbling, rotting and pickling away to introduce at the cult-status Danish establishment (the restaurant was named best restaurant in the world four times, and was re-awarded two Michelin stars last week). Hints of a saffron kombucha he’s working with waft out of the hot chamber, infusing the fermentation lab with south Asian fragrances.Fermentation may currently be enjoying a phase of fascination that cycles through popular culture every few years, but the way Zilber sees it, the practice isn’t making a comeback – it never went away. “It’s always been there. It kept people alive. It served civilization,” he says, sitting in one of the Copenhagen restaurant’s three greenhouses. “I think fermentation is undergoing an understanding.”He’s probably sort of responsible for that, because what comes from Noma is devoured as the gospel. So when Noma’s chef, Rene Redzepi, and Zilber published the Noma Guide to Fermentation last fall, it quickly became a modern edible bacteria bible. Across 100 recipes and nearly 500 pages, the guide covers Noma’s best experiments with seven types of fermentation – lactic acid, kombucha, vinegar, koji, miso, shoyu and garum – all of which make appearances on every dish at the restaurant.“Rene felt a zeitgeist around fermentation and the literature supporting it was lacking, and if any restaurant on Earth was going to be able to speak to it, it was us,” Zilber says.In the guide, they demonstrate how to crank one ingredient out to its punkest form, sometimes with the help of just salt – a technique called lacto-fermentation. The techniques they harness in the lab can  months in the guide they  pages – 14 in the case of the very first recipe, lacto plums – even though it requires just ripe plums and non-iodized salt.A two-page photo grid shows the plums’ evolution as they ferment in a vacuum-sealed bag. By the seventh day they look intergalactic, like 20 suns exploding, but it’s actually just the fruit bursting through loosened skin made to have a “caper-like sharpness” and bathing in its own juice made lemon-sour thanks to fermentation.The plums take five to seven days. The shortest recipe in the guide is for koji – when mold on rice grains or barley converts starch to sugar, contributing “an intense sweetness” – which is ready in two days.A requirement for some recipes that may seem excessive to the humble home cook is a fermentation chamber to control humidity and temperature. In the guide, a photo shows Zilber in an apron, shoulder-length inidual braids gathered into a low ponytail, demonstrating how to build a DIY version with a speed rack, sheet pans and a space heater.“Fermentation is definitely a commitment. It is committing to something. It’s being responsible for life and watching it grow. It’s a slow and patient process,” his Toronto-Canadian roots becoming clear with his pronunciation of the a long “O” in “pro-cess.” “But it’s also being rewarded.”Some recipes require an unusual degree of dedication. The cep shoyu, AKA porcini mushrooms, have to be stirred and tasted every day for the first two weeks, and are only ready to eat about four months after that. The garums, or fish sauces, are ready in about 10 weeks. The hardest concept to grasp about fermentation is the waiting.Ten rooms – some sweet, some sour, some musky and pungent – represent the various transformations of ingredients, expressed by different scents, and provide an ever-evolving pantry for the restaurant. The hot room, kept at 60C (140F), smells like black garlic right now. The miso room smells like ageing miso and other umami-rich caramelized flavors.“Inoculated barley smells like apricots and honeysuckle at 48 hours. It really fills the room,” he says of this finicky form of koji, a closeup photo of which appears in the guide across two pages, resembling a bird’s-eye view of a densely packed wet cotton field.“If you taste the menu, and then you walk into the fermentation lab, into the miso room, and it’s like, ‘Oh, that’s the smell that’s been in my mouth all night’,” he says.Zilber and the four or five other chefs in the lab also just experiment with reactions of food to various applications of fermentation. They tried out wearing white lab coats, like scientists, but quickly scratched that (“It looked like a Colgate commercial where they develop some new teeth whitening,” he says, laughing).“I did some weirrrrd projects,” Zilber says about what helped earn his promotion from chef de partie to director of the lab in 18 months.On Saturdays, Noma’s chefs are invited to present ideas they could see on the menu there. “I would just go completely left field. I’d make dishes of food that required artist’s statements.”His projects developed a reputation for warranting 45-minute debates – like the one where four diners eat the same ingredients prepared and arranged differently and with blinders as an exercise in subjectivity in taste – in place of the usual five-minute critique. “Interns were getting into heated conversations with the head chef about what was food and what was art and that was exactly what I wanted to do.”The first time Redzepi saw one of his projects, Zilber says he looked shocked. “Usually Rene clearly tells you what he likes and doesn’t like. But all he could say was, ‘Well, David, thank you for disrupting projects this week’. I took that as having accomplished something. And all around just being a smartass probably covered the rest.”Smartass in his case means polymath, with some of that encyclopedic databank spilling on to his skin: a tattoo of a map of the solar system within the Milky Way on his right arm, the Schrödinger equation, a description of wave function in physics, on his left.Zilber hasn’t read a novel in 12 years he is “addicted” to non-fiction. He reads during staff meal – “instead of being on Tinder or Instagram”, he says – and just finished The Tangled Tree, a history of how bacteria and horizontal gene transfer upend conceptions of the way species evolve on Earth. He’s currently reading Tamed, a book about the domestication of the 10 most important species to mankind.He relates his fascination with evolution to fermentation: “There are fundamental truths about the way Earth works that absolutely manifest themselves in any facet of life, especially in the wild and chaotic biological ones that you see in fermentation,” he says.“I sneak a little bit of that into the book in the miso chapter, when I equate this Korean idea of son-mat (or hand-taste, meaning each fermenter’s product will taste a bit different each time) to chaos theory. There are parallels between the way fermentation happens and the way the universe happens and I think it’s beautiful,” he says before stopping himself. “Is that too much?”Perhaps, to be in charge of inventing flavors in a lab at one of the most celebrated restaurants in the world is to be consumed by the idea of what else is out there. For Zilber, fermentation is a never-ending exploration.“It’s like poking a hole in a piece of paper and holding it up to the night sky peering through it and being like, aha, the Milky Way. There’s something else out there that’s capable of producing flavors that people have never tasted or imagined before,” he says. “That’s the end game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af24afc674bb822e3e868e103280e83c01d0560/0_239_5523_3314/master/5523.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0186b3a4b4fb6132a3495befe4d2b057","title":"yeni london underwhelming dishes and in yer face pricing","story":"Beyond the front of house team, there is little to delight at this modern Turkish newcomerYeni, 55 Beak Street, London W1F 9SH (020 3475 1903). Starters £9-£17. Mains £21-£32. Desserts £9. Wines from £29Following a major car crash, there’s usually an investigation to work out what caused it. Was it driver error? Or perhaps environmental factors? At some point, the people behind Yeni, a newly opened import from Istanbul to London’s Soho, may wish to conduct such an enquiry. Because right now it really is a pile-up the sort that leaves debris scattered across all three lanes, and slows the traffic on the other carriageway to the speed of spilt treacle as they decelerate to get a serious gander.I am going to exonerate the young team working front of house, who deliver both their script and the often calamitous dishes with a touching grace. Also, I have huge respect for the general manager, who retained a certain dignity when the fire alarm went off and continued to roar at us for a good few minutes. Oh, how she punched that number pad, her fingers moving like she was performing a Liszt piano concerto. For us, the siren came between the main course and the dessert. Even someone as godless as I am is allowed to mutter about the possibility of ine intervention. Maybe this alarm would make dinner stop. But we stayed. It’s called commitment. They’re probably wishing we hadn’t.So no, it’s not the staff working the room. Instead, one must look to Turkish star chef and newspaper columnist Civan Er, whose Istanbul restaurant Yeni Lokanta has won many awards, and his business partner Cem Bilge. But I also sense the dead hand of a consultant someone who implored them to bring their faux-rustic schtick to Britain and charge what the hell they like for it, “because those Londoners will swallow anything”. Yeni weds underwhelming, occasionally disastrous dishes with the kind of in-yer-face pricing that gives the entire restaurant business a wretched name.The problem isn’t that we are used, in the UK, to Turkish food being seriously good value, although it usually is. The many smoky grill houses with which the Turkish community has blessed us, heavy with the scent of rendering lamb fat, are a joy. Nor is it that we look to Turkish food for simplicity. During the many summers I spent in Turkey I fell in love with the kebabs and crisp-crusted lahmacun served up at Fethiye’s bus station cafés. Still, there’s always room for a more evolved take on such a culinary tradition. And yes, here’s the dining room for it, with its Aegean turquoise tiling, its hanging globe lamps and its white brick walls which are almost as distressed as we are by the end. The sad thing is, they never do give us anything evolved or erting.Brows start furrowing early when we are told the two of us should order three or four of the starters, mostly priced in the mid-teens, plus two main courses. We are also told “these dishes will arrive one by one”. We are at the mercy of the kitchen. It starts oddly. Turkey has a thrilling way with breads. There are puffed up, sesame seed-crusted flatbreads, and rich, springy oval loaves and more besides. All of that has stayed firmly in Turkey. In common with almost every restaurant surrounding us, they have bought in some serviceable sourdough. We tear at it disconsolately.Now comes an inoffensive taster of a doughy filled dumpling on a yogurt-based sauce dotted with herb oils. It’s a study in beige, and tastes beige too. These tiny dishes are an opportunity to smack us with flavour, to get us excited. Perhaps they don’t want to get our hopes up. For here come wide ribbons of olive oil-braised celeriac. It’s completely fridge cold, and dotted with brutally acidic bits of unadvertised, coagulating sheep’s cheese. It tastes like something left over from the night before, which may just have had its moment 12 hours ago.After a lengthy break in which we are presented with a dish we didn’t order, quickly taken away, we get a small disc of beef tartare for £16, with a potato croquette filled with liquid egg yolk. It might have worked if the beef hadn’t been minced to such a paste it could be embraced by someone without the benefit of their own teeth. Again, it is served overly chilled. A kind of relief comes in a cheery dish of scallops with a spiced carrot purée and a dollop of sprightly herb sauce and walnuts. On the one hand the scallops are well cooked, the sauces engaging. On the other, there are only two scallops and it’s £17.Ah yes, those damn prices. The nadir is the £21 charged for a huge slumping package of muddy-grey vine leaves filled with chickpeas, the sour, bile-ridden tang of labneh and more leaf mulch. I stare at the dish, then mutter to my companion: “We’d better get the vet in that cow’s not right.” We try to eat it, really we do, but it’s less food than a traumatic experience designed to be character forming. It departs the table looking like a rugby field at the end of a vigorous game on a wet winter’s day.Apparently, the star dish is the “roasted beef ribs, isot pepper, cumin, sourdough”. It reads well, as it should for £26. I’ll have to take their word for it on the roasting. What arrives are ravaged strands of the sort that come with long braising, seemingly mixed with quantities of sticky jus. The other flavourings are obscured. Beneath is a tombstone of now soggy bread. It’s a Turkish dish, but one apparently from that bit of Turkey just to the west of the Pennines. It’s the kind of thing a Lancashire pub would slap on the menu for a tenner and for which we’d all applaud. Nobody is clapping now.There are just two desserts: a mediocre salted-caramel panna cotta, and some tiny custard-filled doughnuts, which are fine. Both cost £9, which is not fine. The short wine list has nothing below £29. Bizarrely, despite Turkey having a robust wine sector, there’s just one Turkish bottle, as against three from Greece. I don’t want to stoke tiresome regional animosities but I do wonder what they’d make of that back in Istanbul. The rest of the list, mostly priced at £40 or more, is European. At the end, a fellow diner further along the communal table we are clinging to tells me he reads these reviews and senses, “this one will write itself”. It didn’t. I had to do that. But Yeni provided all the material.Yeni’s arrival fits with the growth in places offering food from around the eastern end of the Mediterranean. Yotam Ottolenghi’s Rovi, in Fitzrovia, does it very well, and is bang on trend with both live fire cooking and fermentation. It’s an omnivorous menu but vegetables star. Try the sweetheart cabbage with salted anchovy, and the celeriac shawarma (ottolenghirovi).Carluccio’s is to trial a more ‘formal and premium’ evening service at its branch in Richmond, south London. According to CEO Mark Jones, they will introduce new tableware and up the vegan offering. This follows the closure of 35 sites, under a company voluntary agreement (carluccios).A few Louisiana-influenced restaurants are marking Mardi Gras. Newcomer Bayou Bar in Tooting is holding a crawfish boil on 5 March. Meanwhile at Jacob Kenedy’s Plaquemine Lock in Islington there’s live music, special menu items and a general ‘party vibe’ on 3 and 5 March (facebookbayoubarlondon plaqlock).Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db3f286f0ffbeddcf9a597fe6665e988b694fc7/0_0_4087_2452/master/4087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cff68af86e9a6a0946e9eeb57b822631","title":"usa england she believes cup match report","story":"• USA 2-2 England• Lionesses stay unbeaten in SheBelieves Cup in Nashville“A chess match first half and a boxing match second,” said England manager Phil Neville of “an unbelievable advert for women’s football”.A stunning Steph Houghton free-kick had cancelled out an equally impressive Megan Rapinoe strike before Nikita Parris gave England a 2-1 lead against the USA in their SheBelieves Cup match in Nashville. Tobin Heath equalised for the world champions butthis was an impressive performance by Neville’s side. While the visitors had opened the tournament with a come-from-behind defeat of Brazil, it was a second successive 2-2 draw for the hosts.“Both coaches will probably admit that the result isn’t the most important thing but we’ve put on an advert for women’s football that was probably as good as I’ve seen,” said Neville.“I think the first half set up the second, they found it a little bit difficult with our system, but I was a little bit disappointed with our passing, they caused us problems with their diagonals and second phase attack. Either team could have won and my players are slightly disappointed that they didn’t.”In front of 22,125 fans, the hosts presented themselves before the whistle with their backs to the cameras, displaying the names of inspirational women on the back of their shirts insteadof their own.If England needed motivation for a brighter start, aftertheir lacklustre first half against Brazil, facing the titans of women’s football in the home of the Titans wouldprovide it. And within two minutes they were feeling the heat. A Rapinoe corner caused chaos in England’s penalty box before Abby McManus was able to power a clearance off the line.With the USA pressing high, the Lionesses were reeling on the back foot, but a succession of corners for the host side came to little and slowly Neville’s team began to relax.On the half-hour mark, Heath escaped through, racing into the box only for Houghton to catch up and clip the ball from the American’s feet.With neither keeper particularly troubled, and with some wayward passing among the England front line, it took a moment of brilliance to break the deadlock. Abby Dahlkemper released Kelley O’Hara, who swung the ball into the box. It was knocked down by an England shirt before Rapinoe collected and struck it cleanly from just outside the area to put thehosts ahead.The advantage did not last long. Adrianna Franch, making her debut in the USA goal, mistakenly picked up a back pass, thereby conceding an indirect free-kick inside the penalty area. The ball was laid off and Houghton – “world class” according to Neville - curled the ball beautifully around the wall past Franch’s left hand and into the bottom corner.Houghton, fresh from a Continental Cup final win with Manchester City, scored a similar opener from a set piece in last month’s 3-0 FA Cup victory over Tottenham.England picked up where they had left off from the beginning of the second half, and Fran Kirby flicked the ball to Parris who slid the ball beyond Franch and into the corner to give the visitors a 52nd minute lead.Jill Ellis, the USA coach, then chose to switch things around, with Mallory Pugh making way for Christen Press and Becky Sauerbrunn coming in for O’Hara. Still, England came again. Dahlkemper, caught napping, was robbed by Ellen White but the forward’s attempt went wide.With 67 minutes on the clock, Rapinoe, wearing the name of the poet and activist Audre Lorde, was once again the spark for the USA. Her corner caused a familiar scramble and this time Heath was there to fire into the net. Both sides had chances to claimvictory but England will be the happier. A draw made it winner takes all against Japan in Tampa in this competition. There, England’s World Cup credentials will be well and truly in the spotlight against opponents they will face in Group D in France."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96836c2920ab9a46231c216b28926d7f08c3197c/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3796c2eb1cfadeb1d703c4c7413b5a61","title":"football fans owen oyston blackpool charlton coventry","story":"That was a belter of a line from Lieven De Turck, representing the always bewildering Roland Duchâtelet at a forum of Charlton Athletic supporters a few nights ago, when the man reputedly in charge of trying to sell the club floated what viewers of Blackadder might recognise as the “cunning plan” option.He didn’t put it in those terms, of course, but equally I’m not even sure Baldrick would have come up with something quite so brilliantly harebrained as standing up in front of a room of already exasperated football fans and proposing, in one of those lightbulb moments that probably encapsulate Duchâtelet’s five years as Charlton’s owner, that the Football League should get them out of a hole by buying the club.All of which might have come across as some kind of misunderstanding, a wind-up even, were it not for the statement that appeared on Charlton’s website the next morning to clarify that, yes, he was deadly serious. It noted that Duchâtelet’s property had been vandalised and complained of intrusion into his personal life. There was the now‑obligatory mention of “fake news”, referring to one of the stories about the owner’s alleged penny-pinching (namely the rationing of bottled water for players in training sessions), and the killer line was saved for last, having claimed that no foreign investor would possibly want to buy the club and endure the same indignities. “Therefore,” this 668-word piece of tragicomedy concluded, “the owner demands that the EFL acquires his football club.”Well, it’s an idea, I suppose. I particularly like the way he “demands”, rather than simply “requests” or “proposes”, and I hope it is not too impertinent to point out that it is not exactly common practice for a football club to be bought by the league in which it plays. Or, indeed, that he appears to be making an impressive challenge for the 2018-19 trophy as the most preposterous football-club owner in the business.Not that he can be considered the overwhelming favourite just yet when there is so much consistently strong competition elsewhere. Nobody, for starters, could persuade me that any club has had it worse than Coventry City under the hard‑faced ownership of the London-based hedge-fund Sisu and there are plenty of other contenders. At least the supporters of Blackpool are now in a position, finally, to fumigate the corridors of Bloomfield Road and talk of the wretched Owen Oyston in the past tense. Yet it is still very evident that football is awash with clubs where, if you remember the old Monty Python sketch, the people in charge are here on behalf of the Silly party or the Slightly Silly party.Bolton, under the chairmanship of Ken Anderson, have been added to the list this season, especially after the latest reports of staff and players not receiving their wages for February, and Notts County, increasingly, are another one, given the strange set of events that has seen their narcissistic owner, Alan Hardy, take the oldest club in the Football League to 92nd position, accidentally reveal a photograph of his manhood on Twitter, place the club up for sale and invoke the kind of financial chaos that risks them being sent to the knackers’ yard.Hardy made his money at an interiors company called Paragon and, knowing what we do now, that was a curious tweet it put out on 19 January to boast that “we’ve started 2019 on fire” (flame emoji) with £11.7m of new deals in just one week. Back in the real world, Paragon has just gone into administration, putting Notts at significant risk of the same because one appears to be reliant on the other. HMRC, meanwhile, has issued a winding-up petition against the club, to be heard on 10 April. Hardy, to recap, regards Peter Ridsdale, the chairman whose over-spending once prompted the News of the World headline “Post-war Iraq is being better run than Leeds”, as some kind of mentor. Perhaps you can see now why they get on so well.Mostly, I wonder when, or if, the long-suffering fans of Coventry will experience the mix of relief and joy that Blackpool’s supporters will encounter this week now the thousands of boycotters who have stayed away from Bloomfield Road these past few seasons, including distinguished former players such as Tony Green and Eamonn O’Keefe, as well as relatives of the great Stan Mortensen, can look forward to going back, at last.Oyston did not just bring the town’s football club to its knees, he seemed to take a sinister pleasure from his unpopularity, driving around the old seaside resort with an OY51 OUT private registration plate. And now, after all the mutiny and boycotts and perhaps the most brilliantly orchestrated and devoted fan protest there has been in English football, his time is up. Blackpool’s game against Southend next Saturday will be their first at Bloomfield Road since the fans got their way. Supporters are planning a party, starting with a celebration march from the promenade, and perhaps in some small way it can be a reminder for every other club that has inadequate or reviled owners, that things can change for the better, that it won’t always be one crisis after another, and that one of the reasons why this sport pulls us in, why it is so damn addictive, is that the bad times always make the good ones seem so much better.For now, I imagine that will be only small comfort for the supporters of Coventry when it is apparent now that the nadir of Sisu’s reign might not be, as previously assumed, the year-long exile of “home” games being staged in Northampton, six motorway junctions south.The latest from Coventry is that the league has set a Tuesday deadline to establish where the team will play next season, amid the long-running dispute over rent and other issues with the Ricoh Stadium’s owners, the Premiership rugby club Wasps, and Coventry city council, the freeholder. If nothing materialises, an EGM will be held on 25 April to consider expelling the club from the league. No more Coventry City? It would be nice to think that is an empty threat and the followers of this beleaguered old club can cling to the hope that they, like Blackpool, will come out the other side one day. Yet it is no use just assuming everything will be sorted out. Nobody knows, is the truth.The same applies to Notts but if they can bear to look through the gaps in their fingers across the River Trent they might also remember it is only two years since Fawaz al-Hasawi had turned Nottingham Forest into a shell of a club. Forest’s new owners, in the words of the chairman, Nicholas Randall QC, took over a club “in intensive care”. This season they have had their biggest average crowds since the club’s European Cup-winning days. Season‑ticket prices have been slashed and plans have just been announced to turn the City Ground into the biggest stadium in the east Midlands. The moral of the story: things can improve.As for Charlton, the club’s website contains the minutes of their fans’ forum and – well, everyone loves a trier – De Turck’s attempt to persuade everyone that a takeover by the Football League was the most sensible option. “He said they would pass the Fit and Proper Persons’ test, they understand the monthly losses as they have the financial figures of the club, and they have the football knowhow to run it,” it reports. “The fans’ forum unanimously rejected the proposal saying it was unfeasible.”The other option, perhaps, is that Duchâtelet, who has been trying to flog the club since 2017, drops his asking price, which is clearly scaring off potential buyers, accepts it is the end of an eraerror (delete as applicable) and let’s a proud old club breathe again. Now that would be a cunning plan.Perhaps in time Dario Gradi and those charming people at Crewe Alexandra would be decent enough to furnish us with more details about the reasons he once supplied, in legal documents, for moving Barry Bennell out of the club.“I have only ever sacked one person at Crewe and that was Barry Bennell,” Gradi’s evidence from a civil hearing in 2004, never reported until last week, states. “I ultimately sacked him for failing to accept specific instructions regarding a coaching session on the pitch before a game.”Interesting, that one. Bennell, to recap, was the man they knew at Crewe and, before then, Manchester City as “the starmaker”. He was the talent-spotter who discovered or brought through, among others, David White, Gary Speed, Paul Lake, Andy Hinchcliffe, Ian Brightwell, Steve Redmond, Paul Warhurst, Paul Gerrard, Rob Jones, Danny Murphy and Mark Williams. And those are just the ones who went on to win international caps at the various age-levels, even before we get to David Brightwell, Roger Palmer, Gary Blissett and on and on. Just try to think of another man in the modern game who even comes close to such a prolific record – and how coveted that person would be.All of which makes it seem strange that Crewe would sack such a man because of a disagreement over a training session. Not that I would ever doubt Gradi’s evidence, of course, after reading all nine pages of what he had to say. But it certainly must have been serious bearing in mind Bennell was not even sacked after the time he dumped his players in the middle of nowhere to punish them for a poor performance.The story told to this newspaper is that the players were on their way back from a defeat against Manchester United’s youth team and made to get out of their minibus at Beeston Castle, ordered to run around it several times, then told to find their own way home and left to walk, or hitch, the 15 miles back to Crewe (in the days before mobile phones). According to the documents from 2004, a parent complained. Yet neither Gradi nor the chairman, John Bowler, deemed it a sackable offence.Instead, Bennell got the bullet for something that seems entirely more innocuous. What did he do in that training session, as the bibs‑and-cones man, that was so outrageous? What coaching instructions did he fail to carry out? Gradi, reflecting on the one sacking of his long career, does not elaborate. He does not even seem certain which game it involved, recalling that it was “against Liverpool, I think”, and there is nothing in all the other pages of evidence from various Crewe officials to explain it either. A genuine mystery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7164dd5e76fb467c2823b0560936112d06786833/0_184_5843_3506/master/5843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0286c0a4d8208a77acf62f22430e5d69","title":"treasured island a family adventure on the isle of man","story":"With everything from goat walking and gorge scrambling to sunsets, scallops and Viking kings, the Isle of Man is an outdoor playground, as Rhonda Carrier and family discoveredThe boys are buzzing, grinning from ear to ear I haven’t seen them so excited in ages. I must confess, the grownup half of our family has been dreading the idea of donning wetsuits and clambering through a chilly freshwater gorge. But as we progress upstream through the Isle of Man’s Ballaglass Glen, climbing up rocks and under waterfalls and whizzing down natural slides, we concede it’s one of the best things we’ve done together.I wasn’t expecting the Isle of Man to be such an outdoor playground, but there’s far more to do here than you can fit into a week’s holiday. We choose gorge scrambling because it’s completely new to us, but local firm Adventurous Experiences also runs sea kayaking and coasteering sorties around this green island that’s just a 2hr 45min ferry ride from Liverpool.Getting here is all part of the fun, taking in the sea air from the deck of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company’s ferry, watching the ports shrink and grow – or, if you’re my kids, watching movies in the cinema room.We pull into the seaside town of Douglas, just a 20-minute drive from our accommodation – Kionslieu Farm Cottages – where the owner, the charming Fiona, has organised a welcome basket of essentials. Arriving there, the kids are in heaven, barely stopping to check out our cosy converted stone barn when there are so many animals to meet, pet and help feed – from chickens and rabbits to goats and horses. They’re even more excited when Fiona invites us to take the goats out for a walk with her.Kionslieu’s location makes it the perfect choice for those exploring this tiny island – no point is more than a 40-minute drive from our cottage. One of the Isle of Man’s main attractions for us, though, is just a 10-minute cycle from the farm: the mountain bike trails of South Barrule Plantation. If you’ve travelled by ferry, you can bring your bikes for free, but if you don’t have your own, high-quality bikes can be pre-ordered and delivered to the farm, along with helmets, from Simpsons \u0026amp Pedal Power Cycles in nearby Peel.Perhaps the best thing about this hilly area, planted with conifers, is the mountain-biking skills zone. Here we have great fun – and all for free – on the brilliant wooden wall rides, jumps and drops. Then we swing by the popular Ape Mann Adventure Park for high-flying treetop rope courses.Other activities beckon snorkel safaris, horse riding, sea-fishing trips and stargazing are just some of the things you can do with the kids on the Isle of Man. But there’s history in spades too. We venture to the coast, 15 minutes north-west of Kionslieu, to explore the dramatic Peel Castle – originally constructed by the wonderfully named Viking king Magnus Barefoot. Here, we follow the spectacular walk around its ruined walls and steps down to the colourful scallop shells of Fenella beach.These scallops are one of the culinary highlights of the Isle of Man. One of the best and most family-friendly places to sample them is the Sound Cafe at the island’s south-west tip, just past the thatched crofters’ cottages of ridiculously scenic Cregneash.

Our proposals will help to tackle this problem by making it clear in law that victims cannot be prevented from speaking to the police.“Our proposals to change the law around NDAs and confidentiality clauses are just one step of many that we are taking to kickstart cultural change in the workplace. This includes encouraging more women at the top of business and requiring employers to publish gender pay data.”Many organisations, including government departments, use NDAs legitimately to protect confidential information.

Erdem SS19 went to town with it, mixing Victoriana with a 1980s look.There are three keys to success. Apply with a slightly damp brush in a painterly fashion – which is what makeup artist Val Garland did. It looks less contrived. Resist the urge to go more is more (disaster awaits). Keep everything else “barely there” – primed, dewy skin, a hint of lip colour and a natural-looking brow. You’ll appear fresh and modern, so no one will think you’re playing fancy dress.There is something about a dark, smoky eye that is so undeniably covetable. It is sensual, sexy and super cool. Well, in theory anyway… On me, the whole thing is lost in translation.Creating the perfect smoky eye is all to do with astute blending and, just like baking, it is a skill that completely evades me. Doesn’t matter how many ‘How to Get a Smoky Eye’ features I try to replicate, I still end up getting it wrong. Annoyingly, people assume beauty editors also moonlight as makeup artists. That’s like expecting war reporters to be great soldiers.Anyway, I stopped trying, and simply lived vicariously through others. Then I stumbled upon this glossy take on the smoky eye. It’s created specifically for the delicate eye area – it is quite literally easy on the eyes – and honestly, I get wow comments every time I wear it (which is very often).For anyone who has never been able to get on with the intricacies of eyeshadows, this pot of genius is a godsend. It is embarrassingly easy to apply – I literally use my finger to slather it across my lid, and I apply with a brush around my lower lash line. And that’s it: smoky eyes achieved in five seconds flat.Follow Funmi on Twitter @FunmiFetto This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Rihanna’s done it. Katy Perry, Rita Ora and Gwyneth Paltrow have been known to dabble and while there are no clinical studies to prove the benefits of intravenous vitamin therapy, the celebrity wellness trend appears to have gone fully mass market.In a gleaming west London clinic, with plump leather recliners and a TV tuned to Netflix, Yassine Bendiabdallah explains the benefits of his IV treatments. Customers, mostly wealthy and mostly women, visit him for courses of injections promising an array of anti-ageing, anti-stress, brain-boosting, energy-restoring properties. His most popular is the NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which costs £500 and can take up to three hours to administer. “It causes an uncomfortable tightening in your head and chest,” he explains, “but that’s normal”.“There is a significant relationship between the growth in vitamin supplements and injections,” said Tim Hart, a nutritionist at Third Space health club. “A lot of my clients spend hundreds on IV therapy because they believe it has an instant effect. But the reality is that a lot of the time it will be flushed out of the body – so they’re mostly paying for quite expensive urine.”She said vitamin drips were a waste of money: “If someone’s nutrient status is inadequate then a starting point should be improving the quality of diet rather than opting for alternative therapies that may be detrimental.”Fads that proliferate with influencers on Instagram tend to filter through to the mainstream, and it’s here where vitamin drip and supplement selfies have taken hold.“Most of the supplement market is bogus,” said Paul Clayton, a nutritional scientist and former adviser on the committee on the safety of medicines. “It’s not a good model when you have businesses selling products they don’t understand and cannot be proven to be effective in clinical trials. It has encouraged the development of a lot of products that have no other value than placebo – not to knock placebo, but I want more than hype and hope.”Clayton, however, works at the high end of the industry and stands by Lyma, pitched as “the world’s first super supplement” it is sold at £199 for a one-month supply. “It’s not the most rational combination of compounds, they could be more focused, but as a performance-related product, it has an effect on making you look and feel good.”But he seems perplexed that the product, which is popular with models and actors, might be considered essential. “If I was trying to make a public health initiative, this isn’t where I’d start,” he says. “I’m OK standing behind it because I know the science is good but it’s for people who have money to spend on looking and feeling good. I’m not who it’s designed for.”What would he recommend to anyone browsing an aisle of vitamins, keen to improve their physical wellbeing? “Stop smoking, take more exercise and eat lots of fruit and veg.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/481066ea4ceed05d223d6748d3ae7a60871ee450/0_174_5216_3129/master/5216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b23adafed5a2e09b0800eeaee3adb0fb","title":"moving onto solids and our home descends into a fetid swamp","story":"There’s puréed veg everywhere – except my son’s stomachDay 1. It’s well past time we fed our son solids so we prepare little pots of apple, pear and butternut squash purées. The boy appears intrigued at these artisan wares, so neatly prepared we take charming photos. After one repulsed bite, however, he deals us a glare that says, ‘Why are you doing this?’ Each subsequent morsel is greeted as if I’d squeezed the contents of my belly button on to a spoon.Day 4. Each session in his high chair is a loveless tour through a Greatest Hits of his most baffled and contemptuous faces. Still nothing being digested. Astonished and dismayed, he sits, covered in orange fluid, striking the miserable pose of a mid-90s light entertainment figure on Noel’s House Party, gunged within an inch of his life.Day 9. The novelty long since passed, our attempts to get food in his mouth now lack even the marginal advantage of surprise. Being pelted with half-solid foodstuffs has become a routine affront which marks us as permanently deranged. It’s hard to know what babies are thinking, but at lunchtime we have no such difficulty. Every grimace and jerk of his head and body is unmistakable shorthand for, ‘We’ve been through this and I’m not a fan.’ There is purée all over his skin and clothes but none in his mouth or stomach. The entire kitchen is stewing in a coarse patina of decaying mulch. We might not be getting the deposit back.Day 14. The hatred has not softened but has, conversely, made him wise. Some low animal cunning simmers in that furrowed brow, and he anticipates our strikes, batting away that small, stumpy spoon with the nonchalant brio of a taekwondo green-belt. The stains on the wall and ceiling are now permanent, and we dare not remove them in case they’ve become load-bearing.Day 17. Things my son has attempted to taste this week: our kitchen sponge, my big toe, every book he owns and a dog’s ear. Things he’s refused: anything recognisably edible.Day 20. We’ve abandoned homemade purées and find some success in the day-glo plastic pouches of pre-made supermarket mulch. For the first time, a reliably sustainable amount of matter is reaching his stomach. We’re so happy we don’t even mind the bits of drying butternut squash that now descend from the kitchen ceiling in a smelly orange snowfall.Day 21.

That isn’t a boast. That would be like boasting that he had a wool-knit cardigan. Or that he said that things were better in his day. Or never talked about the war. That would be like boasting about having had a grandad. But, oh man, I loved that shed. It was at the end of the garden, past the goal I had set up, past the beds of flowers I trampled with a ball, and it smelt of wood. Glorious wood.It was a workshop. Beyond the clanking of a triple lock on the door was a treasure trove of saws and nuts and bolts and screws and sanders and vices and chisels and bar clamps. Coils of wood shavings covered the floor. Tiny particles of ash hung in the sunlight shining through the little window. The air filled with a deep, fresh-cut scent. No wonder Jesus was a carpenter: the smell of wood is next to godliness.I was reminded of all this when I passed a furniture shop last week and saw a man in overalls sanding down a table in a small courtyard. Of course, I was never any good at cutting wood, or carving or sanding. I made a lot of “door wedges”, a lot of “spare Jenga blocks”. But I was humoured enough to have a go, and isn’t that one of the greatest gifts of grandparents?I get my hit these days by walking in forests. Roaming around the north and south forests of Hampstead Heath in London, where there are more than 800 trees. Some of the oaks are estimated to be at least 500 years old. There is Epping Forest, too. When I am back north, I go walking with a group of friends in the 2,400 acres of Delamere Forest, Cheshire, the largest forest in the county. It’s packed with deciduous trees and evergreens. Different types of wood smell differently: the fresh smell of a maple rounders bat is not the same as a willow cricket bat. The smell of an Edwardian secondhand mahogany desk changing the aroma of a room is its own singular kind of pleasure, separate from the sweet, mossy scent of wet wood after a downpour.Many people enjoy a good sniff of wood. Cedar is a popular ingredient in perfumes (I will always remember an episode of The Apprentice in which one team mixed cedarwood oil with the much more expensive sandalwood oil, blowing £700 from the off). And I don’t know anybody who doesn’t like the smell of Christmas trees or sitting rooms in National Trust properties. I’m not the only one who pines for pine, who goes weak for walnut."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44224c451072a433dcf7c6d9549f4cf578c68cd3/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303130233d725196accc0b4a17d383b2","title":"pyjamas the pub and harry potter my perfect cosy sunday","story":"For me, cosy Sunday mornings are a lazy affair of reading, drawing and playing board games in PJs. But, eventually, restlessness kicks inSnuggled up in bed, my son is squished between me and my partner, my daughter is curled up in a corner, having stolen my pillow, and our big black fluffy cat is purring and walking across the lot of us, searching for an empty spot to lie down in. For 10 whole minutes it’s a blissful, cosy start to the day. Nobody needs to rush to work or school, so we have rare time together to chat and laugh in the dim light of the morning. Then my son’s hungry stomach rumbles, the cat digs his claws into my partner and the magic is broken. It’s still only 6.30am. There’s no rest for the wicked – or parents it seems – so I take my moments of calm where I can.Making a big pot of porridge for the family breakfast feels like instant cosiness at very little cost. Stirring the oats with a wooden spoon is hypnotically soothing and the sound of it bubbling gently, mixed with the enticing smell of warm porridge, gets everyone round the table faster than you can say Goldilocks. Each of us has our own favourite topping – maple syrup, bananas, cinnamon, pumpkin seeds – and we start the day full, warm and happy.For us, cosy Sunday mornings are a lazy affair of reading, drawing and playing board games in our pyjamas. All the usual rules about being tidy and quiet go out the window and my eight-year-old’s Beanos, Michelle Obama’s autobiography and my 10-year-old’s latest Jacqueline Wilson book are strewn around as we compete noisily at Connect 4 and Cluedo. There are happy winners and defiant losers but spirits remain surprisingly high as we all take turns DJing from our Spotify playlists. The morning passes to an eclectic mix of The Greatest Showman, Little Mix and Christine and the Queens.Eventually, restlessness kicks in and we pile on our clothes, boots, hats, scarves and gloves and head outside for a boredom-beating walk. Within minutes the kids have, of course, pulled off their hats, scarves and gloves (they have that enviable childhood power of not feeling the cold), dropped the football they’re carrying and asked if we’re nearly there yet, but we’re all still feeling pretty content as we head for the nearest wide open space. For big walks and dog-watching we go to Hampstead Heath, for a stroll through a farmers’ market we choose Alexandra Palace, or for impressive den-building sticks we head to Highgate Wood. The dens usually start out as half-hearted lean-tos made from a bunch of weedy twigs, but once we all get involved and uncover hefty fallen branches, they transform into Grand Designs-style creations that should probably have planning permission.I’ve learnt the hard way that outdoor family peace depends on having food supplies available at all times. To make sure I don’t end up wasting money on overpriced snacks, I have a flask of hot chocolate and some apples handy in case there are any sudden meltdowns by the kids (or the adults).When the cold finally starts to bite and tiredness creeps up on us, we head off to meet our friends for a pub lunch. Is there anything cosier than walking into a welcoming pub with a roaring fire in the middle of winter? We’re not fans of a formal, heavy Sunday roast instead we’ll share a selection of starters and tuck into something spicy and light for our main course. The children are happy with anything as long as it involves chips. The adults chat and catch up over a bottle of malbec, while the kids muck around and play games on their phones together. It’s a stress-free chance to relax and recharge, then it’s all back to ours for coffee and cake. It’s just the best way to spend quality time with loved ones and fend off any thoughts of Monday’s back-to-work-and-school blues.In the evening, it’s the four of us again, back in our pyjamas and settled down for a movie. The heating’s down low to save on costs and our sofa becomes a nest of cushions and thick, comfy blankets as we get sucked into the world of Fantastic Beasts, Minions or The Incredibles and share a bowl of homemade popcorn.Bedtime for the children comes once they start yawning, and I’ll read them a chapter of Harry Potter or How to Train Your Dragon before tucking them into bed. The lights are low and our voices are quiet, but as we share the adventures of whichever story we’re reading I know that these tranquil moments of togetherness are the ones that will stay with me.Finally, I head for my room and pick something to read from the stack beside my bed. My phone is off, our home is quiet and the cat is back and purring by my feet. It’s the calmest of ends to the cosiest of days.Download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

We want to gather questions from readers and supporters who are experts in related fields, but also those who have personal experiences or reflections to share. In particular we’re looking for positive solutions-based ideas about how we can improve the situation.Lucy Siegle, MP Mary Creagh, and others will be discussing this issue in our next recording.

In the UK alone, it was worth £32 billion in 2017. According to consultants McKinsey, the global apparel, fashion and luxury industry outperformed all other market indexes in profitability between 2003 - 2013, “outstripping even high-growth sectors like technology and telecommunications”. It is believed one in six people on the planet work in the fashion supply chain, yet it remains one of the most polluting industries on the planet. In our next podcast, we want to ask: How can the fashion industry as a whole be held accountable, and what role can the government, and we as iniduals, play in improving this growing issue?The UN says that given the growth in global population, by 2050 the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. Huge numbers of brands still depend on vastly underpaid workers to make clothing meet consumer demand. In 2013’s Rana Plaza tragedy, a Bangladesh textile factory collapsed, killing 1,134 people, despite warnings over the safety of the structure. It transpired that the building housed five garment factories supplying global fashion brands.In addition to concerns over worker safety, the fashion industry has come under scrutiny for its impact on the environment. During just one washing cycle, a washing machine can leach up to 1000,000 microfibres into our waterways, rivers and oceans, and be consumed by fish, other marine life, and in turn, humans. And clothing is often not recycled – it is believed that Americans dispose of about 12.8m tons of textiles annually. In the UK every year, £140 million worth of used but still wearable clothing (350,000 tonnes) goes to landfill. From an environmental perspective, fast fashion is disastrous.The Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) is one example of how celebrities are using their influence to affect change. This pioneering organisation was founded by Livia Firth and Lucy Siegle in 2010, when Siegle challenged Firth to attend all her red carpet commitments in sustainable clothing. At first she wore ‘ethical’ designers, to the ceremonies, including Orsola de Castro, who designed a dress made out of textile waste for the 2010 Oscars. Now, the business has expanded and the pair work with some of the world’s most famous design houses to help them implement more environmentally responsible business practices.Other prototype solutions that are being trialled include: solar textiles, garments made using biological catalysts which are capable of ‘eating’ plastic, 3D printing for clothes, compostable clothes made from materials such as orange fibre and apple leather, and lab-grown leather. But can any of these offer the practical and long-term solution we need? Is it a case of changing our shopping habits, and buying more second-hand clothes? Or should we be aiming for shifts on a bigger scale? How can we put pressure on fashion houses to implement change? And which is the most promising of the scientific innovations in this area?We look forward to hearing from you!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

The group is likely to stick with its current name.It is understood that the group has received donations amounting to several hundreds of thousands of pounds from many hundreds of small donors, and is now actively seeking larger-scale financial backing that will allow it to fund central and regional offices and electoral campaigns.Members of the group are planning a series of regional meetings around the country in the next few weeks at which they hope to attract disaffected supporters of the existing main parties.Sources said that talks were under way with several other Labour MPs –and more Tories – who are unhappy and also considering defecting.The difficulties the group will face in maintaining momentum and building a profile were underlined last week when an amendment it put down calling for another Brexit referendum was not called by the Commons Speaker, John Bercow.The former Labour MP Luciana Berger, who quit Labour over its handling of antisemitism, was also not selected at prime minister’s questions by Bercow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88272ad46f88762dc55791361849e679ed1bbb3/385_193_3367_2020/master/3367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a28ba009d92f4963ea5c0aad217f8469","title":"brexit citizensassembly compromise","story":"Will of the people is a phrase politicians have embraced with gusto since the 2016 Brexit referendum. But one reason parliament remains gridlocked on the issue is that the referendum turned out to be a terrible way of establishing what voters actually wanted. It set the status quo against the vaguest possible formulation of leaving the EU – just “leave” – instead of a concrete proposal that would have allowed a proper debate about the trade-offs and provided a firm mandate.Theresa May is seeking to end the stalemate by running down the clock to force MPs to choose between her deal and no deal. Another option, which I strongly back, is a referendum on May’s deal. But at the moment not enough MPs back it.Might there be another way? In a documentary for Radio 4, I investigate whether a citizens’ assembly could act as a “circuit breaker” by tasking ordinary voters to come up with a compromise. Citizens’ assemblies bring together a group of people, selected to be representative of the country in terms of demographics, to take evidence from experts, deliberate, and develop recommendations on a big question. Impartial facilitators help structure discussion and ensure everyone gets a say.Calm deliberation on Brexit might sound like a stretch. But international evidence suggests ordinary people can do better than politicians at thrashing out a compromise on isive issues.Ireland held a citizens’ assembly in 2016 on abortion. One of just a handful of European countries to ban abortion in almost all circumstances, it had long been a contentious issue. Two-thirds of members voted in favour of abortion on demand in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Its deliberations were worlds away from a Facebook or Twitter debate. Louise Caldwell, who took part, told me that, with a couple of exceptions, you wouldn’t have known whether members were pro or anti. They were more focused on probing experts and considering the evidence. They asked to hear personal testimony from those affected, but also grappled with technical medical and legal evidence. People broadened their perspectives and some changed their minds.This is what’s so attractive about citizens’ assemblies: they enable people from different backgrounds and perspectives to find common ground. They undermine the patronising but fashionable idea we’ve become two cultural tribes who no longer know how to talk to each other. And in the right circumstances they can profoundly shift the national debate. Socially conservative politicians changed their minds. Campaign groups watched the deliberations, and they informed the referendum campaigns that followed.Could this approximation of democratic nirvana help us with Brexit? Before we get too excited, there are a couple of snags. Would MPs ever entrust people with this? UCL’s Constitution Unit ran a Brexit citizens’ assembly in 2017. It was representative of the country, with more leavers than remainers. In a soft Brexit versus no-deal trade-off, its members favoured staying in the single market and customs union, and seven in 10 thought free movement of people should continue if we made full use of the controls available.These recommendations hardly ever get referenced not just because it wasn’t convened by parliament, but because it’s not what many politicians want. Without buy-in from both prominent leavers and remainers, the recommendations of even an official assembly risk getting trashed by one side. Consensus on the need for an assembly is even more important when there’s a risk it could be seen as a cop-out. Australia’s Labor government was elected in 2007 promising action on climate change but faced significant opposition from business. It pledged to hold a citizens’ assembly in 2010, but it was almost universally ridiculed as an elaborate way to circumvent an election promise. The idea was dropped.But even if May’s deal gets through sooner rather than later, we face years of discussion – in other words, further political gridlock – about out future trading relationship with the EU. And so, whatever happens, politicians should let ordinary voters have a go to see if they can do any better.Sonia Sodha, chief leader writer of the Observer, is presenting Analysis: Deliberative Democracy on Radio 4 on Monday 4 March at 8.30pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80497d055542a7eecb621d55213979f7f53582d/0_55_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8df304d4642478dba1d2e654ff92527","title":"women politics democrats emerge america virginia","story":"The 2018 midterm elections saw a record number of women elected to Congress. Now, women are organising to make the ‘moment’ into a movementJust days after the most female freshman class in American history was sworn into the 116th Congress in January, the next wave of aspiring women candidates gathered in the basement of a university building in downtown Richmond, Virginia.Together over the next six months, these women will learn the fundamentals of running for office – how to build a campaign team, deliver a stump speech and raise money.The prospective candidates mostly lack political experience, but they have ambition – a trait that is celebrated at Emerge Virginia, part of the Emerge America national training program for Democratic women started in California in 2002. The non-profit aims to help women overcome the obstacles that have long kept the corridors of power overwhelmingly male.One of the new trainees in the Virginia program is Ivory Dean, a science policy fellow in Washington DC, who plans to start her career in local politics. But, with Washington in turmoil and a nation ided, she fully intends to one day run for president of the United States.“We need leaders now more than ever,” Dean said. “So I asked myself, why am I waiting for someone else to come along and be that leader?”The 2018 midterm elections saw the biggest jump in women elected to the House since the original “Year of the Woman” in 1992. The new Congressional class was the youngest and most erse in history, ushering in a wave of political firsts that include the first two Native American women and the first two Muslim women elected.“In politics there are these jolts to the system and something fundamental happens,” said Jennifer Lawless, a professor at the University of Virginia, who writes extensively about women in politics. “It’s likely that 2018 was that year.”Now the task for groups like Emerge, Emily’s List, She Should Run and VoteRunLead, which have seen record recruitment since Donald Trump’s election, is to make sure 2018 wasn’t just a “a fad, fancy, or a year”, in the words of the trailblazing senator Barbara Mikulski– and that progress towards equal political representation for women not only continues but accelerates.There’s optimism that the gains made in 2018 are a sign of lasting change.“The trail is being blazed on a daily basis by other women candidates,” said Julie Copeland, the executive director of Emerge Virginia. “I just don’t see any signs of that changing.”Sitting around the horseshoe table near Dean was Jenny High, a business consultant from Glen Allen, north-west of Richmond.She is eyeing an opening on the local school board. Laura Sellers, a counterintelligence analyst from Stafford and the only woman in the Emerge Virginia 2019 cohort to hold elected office – had just committed to challenging the Republican incumbent in Virginia’s senate district 28. Over the next several months of training, Copeland will help connect the trainees with party leaders, elected officials and the sprawling network of Emerge alumnae – many of whom are now positioned to help other women climb the ladder.In early 2017, Copeland received a text messagefrom Jennifer Boysko, an old friend and alumna of a previous Emerge Virginia program who was, at the time, a member of the Virginia house of delegates. Boysko told Copeland she had overheard in the chamber cloakroom that the incumbent from Virginia’s 56th district would not seek re-election in that year’s state races.Copeland immediately thought of two women in the current training program: Melissa Dart and Abigail Spanberger. Neither had ever run for office before but she believed they were ready. She learned that Spanberger was already considering a run for Congress, so Copeland encouraged Dart and she decided to give it a go.“This is what men have done since … forever,” Copeland said. “Now we finally have women on the inside who are helping to build that pipeline.”In June 2017, Dart won her primary. Though she ultimately lost to the Republican in the staunchly conservative district,Dart and many of her staffers put their efforts into Spanberger’s congressional campaign.In November 2018, Spanberger, a former spy, ousted conservative Republican David Brat in a coup for Democrats. Boysko, who started the chain, won a special election to take the state Senate seat left by Jennifer Wexton, who flipped the took her place on Capitol Hill as a rookie member alongside Spanberger and the rest of the record-setting female class.As for Dart, she will be on the ballot again this year, running for a seat on the Henrico county school board.“We learned in candidate training that if you’re not at the table you’re on the menu,” she said, explaining her decision to run again. “We are so done with the sidelines. It’s like un-ringing a bell. You can’t.”After the original Year of the Woman saw a wave of glass-ceiling-smashing and barrier-breaking women were elected to Congress in 1992, progress toward gender parity essentially plateaued.Not this time, says Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily’s List, the fundraising powerhouse that has helped to elect pro-choice women since 1985.“The history we made in 2018 wasn’t the end of our work, and it wasn’t the beginning – it was a culmination of decades of hard work by our organization and our movement, and a sign of much more to come in the years ahead,” she said. Debra Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, thinks the female-led activism and momentum generated by big gains for women in the Trump era are signs that 2018 was not an outlier – but neither was it “mission accomplished”.“The reality is that yes, this was a very good year for women,” Walsh said. “We had a record number of women running, but we need to see more, because we know that when women run they win at the same rate as men do.”In 2020, more women are running for president than ever before. But after the defeat of Hillary Clinton, the first ever female nominee of a major party, some Democrats are wary of a woman leading the party’s ticket.Spanberger, the newly elected Virginia congresswoman, is baffled by this analysis. Before 2018, the voters of Virginia’s 7th district had never elected a woman – or a Democrat – to the seat.“There was a lot of nail-biting about what sort of candidates can win in competitive districts,” Spanberger told the . “One of the lessons we learned in 2018 is that no matter what has historically been the case we cannot judge what voters want because we’ve now been proven wrong multiple times.”As the afternoon waned on the first day of Emerge Virginia’s candidate training, communication coach Courtney Knapp asked for a show of hands of those who had ever been told they were “too” emotional, “too” abrasive, or “too” ambitious. One by one, hands went up.“Welcome to the too club,” Knapp said. “Now take away the too and all of these are great attributes.”The exercise sparked an animated conversation about how to run authentically in the face of stereotypes, double standards and gender bias.Listening to her classmates,High, of Glen Allen, smiled and clasped her hands together.“The class of 2019 is going to have the most women come out as elected officials,” she said, her voice booming over the buzz. There was a pause and then a burst of applause."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94078443f409cdefe176b7e804fc64d0eaab52ef/0_17_5209_3125/master/5209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=651e2ac556c5518767ccb33d623bb78d","title":"raise legal smoking age to 21 say mps","story":"Smokers will be banned from buying cigarettes until they are 21 as part of measures to improve public health being considered by the government.An influential cross-party group of MPs has proposed raising the minimum smoking age and introducing a levy on big tobacco companies to fund measures to encourage people to quit and to prevent youngsters taking up the habit.The parliamentary group on smoking and health, backed by 17 health charities and medical organisations, also wants to tighten the rules on showing smoking on TV and in films.“Smoking remains the leading cause of premature death and health inequalities,” said Tory MP Bob Blackman, chair of the group. “Ratcheting up tobacco regulation further and faster is essential to achieve the government’s vision for prevention, to increase healthy life expectancy while reducing inequalities between the richest and poorest in society.”The group, which was instrumental in introducing plain packaging and banning smoking in public places, believes it is pushing at an open door.Hancock has said the government is prepared to introduce new legislation to curb smoking rates. “Smoking remains one of the biggest causes of years of life lost in Britain and other countries,” said David Halpern, who heads the government’s behavioural insight team or “nudge” unit. “The good news is that we have learned a great deal about how to help smokers quit. Pushing forward on this agenda is one of our single best bets to extend life expectancy in the UK, particularly among disadvantaged communities.”The group’s submission to the government’s green paper is backed by Action on Smoking and Health, and 16 other health and welfare organisations, including the British Medical Association, Cancer Research UK, the Royal College of Physicians and the British Heart Foundation. It also calls for the collection and publication of tobacco manufacturers’ sales and marketing data, to monitor the evolving behaviour of the industry, and inserts for cigarette packs with messages encouraging people to quit. There would also be increased funding for education campaigns on social and mass media.Baroness Finlay, a vice-chair of the group, said action was needed because “smoking rates among young people have now started to flatline and the inequalities gap is widening”.Raising the age limit at which people can buy cigarettes to 21 would put the UK on a par with only a few countries and cities in the world, including Honduras, Kuwait and New York City. But it is the introduction of a levy, now said to be under serious consideration by ministers, that could prove the most alarming to the tobacco industry.Under the new proposal, each tobacco manufacturer would effectively have to pay an annual fee based on the volume of smoked cigarettes it sold in the UK, potentially raising hundreds of millions of pounds. But the tobacco industry has fought hard to resist successive governments from introducing legislation that would reduce its profits.Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said: “Legislation to strictly regulate smoking used to be considered controversial and extreme by all mainstream political parties but governments now have confidence that tough tobacco regulation both delivers results, and, crucially, has widespread cross-party and public support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/280cbf84e4eb19c2d091fe488875d96a854a4f31/0_210_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80a2829e05776223e5d9327fed47028d","title":"cheltenham festival paisley park andrew gemmell stayers hurdle","story":"It seems unlikely that many of the owners who gather at next week’s Cheltenham Festival will be sharing stories of their time on a picket line in South Yorkshire during the miners’ strike. But one of them at least will be able to do so, thanks to the presence of Andrew Gemmell, whose Paisley Park is widely fancied to win the Stayers Hurdle on Thursday week.His history as a trade union official is just one of the ways in which Gemmell differs from your stereotypical owner but he is a match for anyone in his enthusiasm for racing and sport in general. Blind since birth, he latched on to radio commentaries as a reliable source of entertainment while he was a boy in the 1960s and that passion has lasted so well that in recent years he has circled the globe on his way to Kentucky Derbies, Melbourne Cups, cricket Tests and tennis finals.Gemmell has also bought himself little slices of the action from time to time. If you have heard of an ownership syndicate in horse racing, he has been in it, from Million In Mind through Favourites Racing to Highclere and others, and he has had shares in some talented animals that way. Things have gone less well when he has struck out on his own a handful of not-very-flashy animals have carried his own blue, pink and maroon colours.But then came Paisley Park, the handsome, athletic bay who bolted up by 12 lengths in his January prep race at Cheltenham. His is a story to make any owner groan with envy at Gemmell, who gave a budget of £100,000 to the trainer Emma Lavelle and asked her to find a promising young animal. When owners do that, they can hardly be surprised that the final bill often comes to £100,000, but the canny Lavelle shelled out just £60,000 in 2015 for Paisley Park and he has already won that back three times.Unbeaten in four races this winter, the horse returns to Cheltenham as one of the hottest favourites for next week. Bookmakers will give you no bigger than 7-4 about him and, despite himself, Gemmell is starting to anticipate what it would be like to own a Festival winner, almost half a century after he first attended the race-meeting to witness The Dikler win the Gold Cup.“I’m feeling really nervous,” he confided over lunch in a north London pub last week. “You’re excited to have a horse in a big race but when you’ve got the favourite, it puts extra pressure on you. I’m really optimistic but I’m also bracing myself for disappointment.”He last experienced this kind of tension in 2015, when he bought into the Ascot Gold Cup winner Trip To Paris and accompanied him to Australia, where the horse ran second in the Caulfield Cup and fourth in the Melbourne Cup. For most of the buildup to the Flemington race, Gemmell was the only syndicate member in the country and so found himself telling his story again and again to media outlets, just as he is once more doing back home.To be in this position again is a great thrill for the 66-year-old who, as a teenager, persuaded the school handyman to place his bets. It was an intoxicating time for a young racing fan, Arkle beating Mill House at Cheltenham every spring while Lester battled Scobie around Epsom each June. Right Tack in the Guineas of 1969 was a notable early success for Gemmell. Four years later, he did not immediately warm to Red Rum, having obtained 20-1 about Crisp, famously collared by the great horse in the Grand National’s final strides.Work intervened but Gemmell found ways of keeping in touch with racing while serving in the social services department of Westminster city council, where, if a race was particularly important, he would sometimes risk listening to the commentary by phone. “How long are you going to be, Andrew?” he recalls his boss asking. “About four furlongs,” he replied.He became a shop steward and Nalgo official and remembers clashing with Shirley Porter, “when she was selling the cemeteries cheap”. His union branch was twinned with an NUM branch near Doncaster, explaining his brief involvement in the miner’s strike.An inheritance has since allowed Gemmell to make his entry into racing as an owner, though he was beginning to think of pulling his horns in before Paisley Park started winning large dollops of prize money. His betting has also helped top up funds from time to time.“I study the form as much as I can. I’ve got friends who read stuff to me. I watch a lot on the television and take in as much as I can. I try my best to keep up to speed with everything. I’ve got one friend who rings me on Saturdays with all the Racing Post news.”When Paisley Park is running next week, Gemmell will base himself in the paddock, where he can hear the commentary and a handful of close friends can keep him updated by watching the big screen. “The horse is extremely well, touch wood. Everything’s gone right this year, so we can’t really complain, win or lose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9a2a4b7ca6aa97c6fc6398fafc64d1a1f3bb82a/0_0_3584_4637/master/3584.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c27d5fad7ada8a46ffba8c74eb3ac4ea 480w","title":"tip a great beach cafe or bar in europe for a chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Good food and drink can set a beach venue apart from the rest, especially if there’s a cool view.

We pick 10 with beautiful views from a new guide, Wild Ruins BCOn the slopes around the modern-day cairn on Dunkery Beacon are the remains of at least five bronze age cairns, from 2000-1600BC. They were burial sites topped with stone but, after a few thousand years, not all are in good shape. The largest and most visible is on the north side, a large mound, 22 metres across. It may have been the closest place to the gods, so a fitting place to enter the afterlife. Some visitors climb from Dunkery Bridge car park, just over half a mile away others prefer the three-mile route from the east, along Macmillan Way from Wootton Courtenay. It’s the highest point in Somerset, and the views are wonderful.Near Dorchester, this is one of the most iconic hillforts in England: at 47 acres – the size of more than 50 football pitches – it is also our largest, and may even be the biggest in Europe. It was originally the site of a causewayed enclosure, a ritualistic tribal meeting ground in the neolithic period (4000 to 2500BC). The site was put to use again in around 600BC as a small hillfort, which was later expanded to the vast site we see today. People lived and worked here, making textiles and working metal. Their roundhouses were built in rows, much like our modern streets. It is a beautiful site to visit, with stunning views across the Dorset countryside. Although the largest, it is not the only hillfort in Dorset: there is the tree-covered Weatherby Castle to the north-east, the tumbling remains of Flower’s Barrow on the coast and Woolsbarrow hidden away in Wareham ForestThe 17th-century diarist John Evelyn said the view from this hillfort atop Herefordshire Beacon was “one of the godliest vistas in England” and it is still regularly cited as one of Britain’s best views. It certainly is stunning, and it is not hard to see why iron-age Britons chose to build here, in the second century BC. The tiers of ramparts, built up throughout the latter iron age, stretch for more than half a mile and enclose an area of 13 hectares (32 acres). At the height of its occupation, there could have been as many as 120 hut circles on the site, housing a substantial population. The nearest parking is opposite the Malvern Hills Hotel. An easy walk to the south is a second hillfort owned by the National Trust, known as Midsummer Hill.Nearly a third of the neolithic stone axes found in Britain are made of Langdale hornstone, or greenstone, found near the summits of Pike of Stickle (pictured) and Harrison Stickle, two of the Langdale Pikes – a difficult place to get to. Broadcaster Neil Oliver says the site of the Langdale axe factory, in the Lake District, might have been as important as the axes themselves. Such was the industry on this site that rejected axes can still be found to this day on the scree slope east of the summit of Pike of Stickle. For those willing and able to brave this treacherous place, a manmade cave can be found around 50-100 metres down the scree slope. It is possible this was a Neolithic construction, built for the axe carvers to retreat into when the weather turned on the mountainside. It’s best reached from New Dungeon Ghyll car park.On top of Arbory Hill are the well-preserved concentric banks of a multi-rampart fort, with extensive views over Clydesdale. Today, the railway line and the M74 take advantage of this opening in the hills, but it would have also been an important route for the Romans, with the remains of their road visible as a scar in the landscape. It is even probable that they in turn built over an existing iron age trackway or trade route. The fort may have supported a small population, as remains of a timber-framed house and a rectangular stone foundation have been found in the inner circle. For a bird’s-eye view of the fort, continue up neighbouring Tewsgill Hill. It’s a 45-minute walk from a layby on Station Road, Abington.This hill fort (not to be confused with the vitrified fort of the same name in Forgandenny) is a stone’s throw from Edinburgh, on the north-eastern end of the Pentland Hills at Easter Howgate, looking down to the Glencorse reservoir. During the middle of the first millennium BC, the fort would have had a large wooden gateway guarding the entrance, of the kind later built for timber colonial forts in the American wild west. Later in the fort’s history, two more earth ramparts were built, and it is thought that the earth house was constructed after the Roman occupation. The Votadini, who constructed this fort, also commanded the one on the extinct volcano of Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh. Park at Castle Knowle car park, near Glencorse.A stone crown sits atop a remote Welsh hill in an area with very few signs of habitation. Far below, a steam train chugs through the valley, but here there is only the sound of the wind through the stones. A local guide poetically translates the name as “fortress of waves on the hill”, but it could also mean “hill of the throne with the flag”. Neither Victorian treasure hunters nor 1930s army target practice even dented the majesty of this isolated bronze age cairn. The stones would have once stood upright, but they have slipped outwards, giving it its current crown shape. Today it is little more than a mass of stones, but the 1920s Inventory of the Ancient Monuments of Wales describes the remains of a burial chamber eight feet by five, with a two-foot stone resembling the gables of the house.

Her days typically begin at 5am, don’t end until 11pm, and are filled with shuttling her nine-year-old son to school, helping him with his homework, preparing meals and running an online clothing business.“It’s hard to find time even to sleep for a few minutes in a chair,” she says, sitting in a McDonald’s while her son plays a game on a phone, the detritus of a Happy Meal in front of him.Most tiring is the constant worry over whether she is doing enough to help him get ahead. He goes to music lessons, taekwondo classes and extra English tutoring. She spends the first week of every summer and winter break helping him prepare for the next term. Sometimes her son’s workload is so heavy that Xu does his assignments for him, using her left hand to make her writing more childlike.“There are too many children and the competition is too high. If you don’t do well in school you can’t get into a good university, and then maybe you can’t get a good job in the future,” she says. She is visibly anxious when discussing the prospect of a second child, something that until three years ago would have been forbidden under Chinese law. “If we were to have another child, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have the energy for them,” Xu says.Faced with a population that is shrinking and ageing, Chinese policymakers are attempting to engineer a baby boom after more than three decades of a Malthusian family planning regime better-known as the one-child policy. Central policy planners have loosened restrictions on family sizes, and now all married couples can have two children. There is talk of the limits being dropped altogether, and amid aggressive propaganda drives, local officials are experimenting with subsidies and incentives for parents.But these efforts appear to be too little too late. Birthrates have fallen and are likely to continue to drop as parents like Xu decide against having more children. More young women are pushing back against state propaganda and family pressure, while improving education standards and income levels have delayed marriage and childbirth. Moreover, decades of the one-child policy have made single-child households the norm, experts say.“China should have stopped the policy 28 years ago. Now it’s too late,” says Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and a longtime critic of the family planning policies.Demographers warn that China’s population will begin to shrink in the next decade, potentially derailing the world’s second-largest economy, with a far-reaching global impact. China’s birthrate last year was at its lowest since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949, with 15.23 million births, dramatically lower than the 21-23 million officials had expected.By 2050 as much as a third of the country’s population will be made up of people over the age of 60, putting severe strain on state services and the children who bear the brunt of caring for elderly relatives.Nowhere is this trend more obvious than in China’s rust belt, the north-eastern region better-known as Dongbei which has the lowest birthrates in the country, the result of strict enforcement of family planning limits and the region’s early development. For residents in Shenyang, the largest city in Dongbei, in central Liaoning province, it’s obvious why few families are willing to have more children – the economy.Rich in resources such as iron ore and coal, Dongbei was at the heart of the country’s heavy industry between the 1950s and 1970s. During the reform era, industries moved southward to the coastal regions, and the state-run companies that employed most Dongbei workers have struggled, causing a mass exodus to other parts of China.“Shanghai, Guangzhou, all these cities are moving forward, but Shenyang has stayed in place. All the high-rises don’t change anything,” says Zhang Yang, 36, who works in purchasing for a local state-owned company. “Few people are having babies because the economy is so bad.”During Dongbei’s heyday, Shenyang was the region’s economic hub, with blocks of factories lining its main street. Now those buildings have been replaced by high-rise apartments, banks and hotels while the factories have been relocated to a suburb outside the city. The new economic zone, the new home for these factories, is quiet.Workers in grey jumpsuits walk along the road just before noon. A sign on a taxi calls on Shenyang residents “to fight” for the rejuvenation of their city. Neighbourhoods in the old industrial sector are being torn down to make way for new buildings.The birthrate here is especially low, at 8.79 per 1,000 women, compared with the national average of 12.43 in 2017. The city is ageing quickly – a quarter of residents were above the age of 60 in 2017, and local population experts believe the city will soon overtake Shanghai to have China’s oldest populace.Dongbei’s struggling economy is the main reason Zhang and his wife have decided not to have another child. He has not had a wage increase in three years. When his son goes to kindergarten in a few years, he expects about half of his income will go toward his schooling and extra classes and activities.His hope is that his son will go to university in the south of China and pursue a career and life there. “It’s not that I’m worried about Liaoning’s future. I have no hope for it at all,” Zhang says.Birthrates in Dongbei, home to about 109 million people, have fallen steeply. The average number of children per woman was 0.9 in 2000 and 0.56 in 2015, according to Yi. That means the next generation will be a quarter of the size of the last one.Last summer, Liaoning released a Population Development Plan, vowing to raise the province’s birthrate by “working hard to create good public opinion about having two children”. Officials promised to explore subsidies for families with two children, encourage employers to offer more services for families, and support women returning to work after giving birth.While parents in Shenyang say they have noticed an increase in nursing facilities at shopping centres and other public spaces, they have yet to see any substantial support from the government. “For all these years, there haven’t been any policies to help. Government pledges like these are like thunder without raindrops. This is like lying to a little child,” Zhang says.Dongbei offers an example of what is to come for the rest of the country. As an early industrial hub, the province urbanised quickly, with incomes and education levels several years ahead of the national average – factors that act as natural constraints on the birthrate, according to experts. As other parts of the country go through similar stages of urbanisation and economic growth, they are going through comparable declines.“This is not just Dongbei but the whole country. You know what they say in economics: development is the best birth control,” says Song Limin of the Population Research Institute at Liaoning University.Researchers believe the national rate of births could fall further. Last year’s low rate surprised many. Liang Jianzhang, a professor of economics at Peking University, says he and his colleagues had expected births to peak in 2017 and begin falling after 2018.“That peak apparently arrived in 2016, with births dropping ever since … What we can expect now is that the number of newborns will continue to shrink rapidly in 2019 and beyond,” he wrote in an editorial in January.“It can be said with certainty that even though 2018 saw a low number of births, that number will not be surpassed for the next 100 years. China will never see more than 15 million newborns in the future,” he predicted.Local governments across China are struggling to reverse the declines with subsidies, propaganda initiatives and new regulations on wokplace leave. In Xiantao, Hubei province, hospitals have offered to cover the costs of childbirth as well as give a 500 yuan (£60) subsidy for the first child and another 700 for the second. In Changsha, in southern China, an advertising campaign last year listed “1,001 reasons to have a baby”. Between 2016 and 2017, almost all provinces extended maternity leave.Some worry that such measures will turn coercive, with the authorities deploying an extensive family planning apparatus to encourage births. Officials once restricted population size through heavy fines, forced abortions and sterilisations.“There is a danger that the government sees that what it has tried so far has failed, and it has to become more coercive. There’s a long history in population planning of extreme coercion. There is no question that the government could adopt coercive measures,” says Leta Hong Fincher, author of Betraying Big Brother: The Feminist Awakening in China.Critics say that less invasive but still punitive measures would probably emerge gradually at local level under the guise of other causes such as preventing sex-selective abortions. Several provinces have banned abortions after 14 weeks, and Jiangxi province in the south requires the signature of three medical professionals before the procedure can be performed. More provinces have put in place obstacles to getting orces, including a test or mandated cooling-off period.Government language has alarmed people. Last year an article in the state-run People’s Daily said: “The birth of a baby is not only a matter of the family itself but also a state affair.” In August, an economics professor from Nanjing University wrote an editorial proposing a “birth fund” that citizens contribute to, then cash in when they have children. Those who don’t have children would get the money when they retire.One internet user wrote: “When you don’t want children, you force people to get sterilised. When you want more, you urge us to give birth. What do you think I am?”For now efforts have focused on cajoling women into have more children for the good of the country. The All China Women’s Federation, a government-affiliated organisation, has been running a “beautiful families” campaign, praising women who serve as primary caretakers of their parents and children.“The party state sees the declining population as a real problem, and it’s women’s duty to respond to that,” says Jane Golley, an associate professor at Australian National University, who focuses on the Chinese economy and labour economics. “It’s a new era of control over women’s reproductive choices.”Yet more women are resisting government and societal pressure, and officials are waking up to their concerns. China’s education and human resources ministries have ordered employers to stop asking female applicants about their marital status and plans for children, a common practice.Ye Liu, a sociologist and lecturer in international development at King’s College London, has been interviewing Chinese women in their late 30s. When the two-child policy was introduced in 2016, most of her respondents were in what should have been the “second spring” of their careers, with the raising of their first child already behind them, with seniority and more bargaining power at work. Many were devastated rather than overjoyed by the new policy.Public resentment is one reason why policymakers did not stop the policy sooner. According to Yi Fuxian, the Wisconsin academic, China could have completely scrapped population controls in 1980 and growth would have moderated naturally. But family planners relied on overinflated school enrolment and overreported births by hospitals, iniduals and local governments. “Why did we follow such a wrong policy for so long? The Chinese government doesn’t want to admit it’s wrong. It says the policy was right but now is the time to change. If it just says the policy was wrong, the public will become angry,” he says.Living in a city with some of the lowest birthrates, Shenyang residents appear surprisingly focused on children. Groups of parents and grandparents tote small children around shopping centres filled with playgrounds and stores advertising toys and educational games. Parents describe the range of activities they can choose from: sensory classes for babies, baby swimming classes, taekwondo, Chinese calligraphy, English tutoring or drawing.The Dunnan True Love Centre in central Shenyang offers high-end convalescence for mothers recuperating after childbirth, a Chinese tradition known as “sitting the month”.This is part of a focus on “quality over quantity”, where families invest all their resources into one child, says Wang Libo, an expert on population at Shenyang Normal University. Of the 500 clients the centre received last year, only three have had a second child, as far as they know. But they expect business to be brisk this year: the year of the pig in the Chinese calendar is associated with luck and wealth and thus an auspicious year to be born.For many families, the pressure to help their child compete is the main reason for having just the one. Xu sends her son to extra tutoring and lessons but worries that he is under too much pressure. She has read articles about children, pushed too hard by their parents, who have killed themselves or run away from home. She tries to find a place in his schedule for some free time, and buys him all the comics and books that he wants. Still, when he performs a little worse on a test or assignment, she grows anxious again. “You can’t help but wonder: what if I pushed him to study for just 10 more minutes?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23c881f600deb2466a0602c2f15428cf98f79fe1/0_70_2977_1787/master/2977.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1cb549f8a0e8b5d7ef52c8c950b12e0","title":"sudan bashir shuffling power may be first steps change","story":"Bashir has declared state of emergency and promoted ally to head off internal party revoltStreet protesters in Sudan pressing for a change of leader and regime achieved a remarkable turnaround last week – but not the sort they were hoping for.President Omar al-Bashir, who seized power in a coup 30 years ago and has clung on tenaciously since, unexpectedly stood down as head of the ruling National Congress party (NCP). But rather than open the door to reform, as protesters demanded, Bashir gave power to a close ally – who, like him, has been charged by the international criminal court (ICC) with war crimes in Darfur.Ahmad Harun, former governor of North Kordofan state, would serve as acting party leader, an NCP statement said. Harun was appointed deputy leader last week, after Bashir declared a state of emergency.The move by Bashir – who remains president – may have been tactical, analysts say, designed to defuse tensions within the ruling party between its Islamist wing and senior military figures representing the security establishment.Perhaps he had no choice. The state of emergency declaration, Bashir’s simultaneous dismissal of his government, and his replacement of all 18 state governors with loyalists, could have been necessitated by a threatened internal party putsch, the International Crisis Group (ICG) thinktank suggested.It is also possible Bashir’s decision to step back marks the beginning of the end for one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders. Like Algeria’s 81-year-old president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika – also the target of big weekend demonstrations – Bashir, 75, is a long-time fixture who seems to have outstayed his welcome.Bashir has battled international ostracism and western sanctions since being accused by the ICC of overseeing a genocide in Darfur in the early 2000s that killed an estimated 300,000 people. In a  interview in his Khartoum palace in 2011, he denied the charges.The decades-long war that ended with South Sudan’s independence in 2011 also weakened Bashir’s leadership and deprived Khartoum of vital oil revenues. NCP mismanagement and corruption have helped bring Sudan’s economy to its knees.New generations of Sudanese, including doctors, engineers and younger party members frustrated by multiple governance failures, have plainly run out of patience, as have impoverished urban workers. Hence the persistent anti-Bashir protests in many town and cities, the biggest since 2013.The latest round of demonstrations began in December, sparked by a sharp rise in the price of bread. But unrest quickly took on a political complexion, with demands for Bashir’s resignation and an end to NCP hegemony.Despite vicious and uncoordinated attempts by the security forces to halt the protests – Human Rights Watch says more than 50 people have died – and a half-hearted offer of dialogue by Bashir, demonstrations continued at the weekend. So far, however, the protesters lack leaders or clear objectives, let alone a plan for a post-Bashir era.Opposition is focused, in part, on proposed constitutional changes that would allow Bashir to stand for re-election in 2020. These have now been deferred. But Bashir could yet run again – if he obtains NCP backing – and has meanwhile placed the entire country under de facto martial law.As in 2011, when emergencies were declared in several provinces to quell unrest, this entails additional army deployments, roadblocks to control civilian population movement, arbitrary arrests and seizures, media censorship and bans on anti-regime political groups. Security forces can and do act with impunity.It is unlikely the promotion of Harun, who may hope to become Bashir’s heir apparent, will bring radical change. Like his mentor, he holds uncompromising views on the challenges facing the country.Interviewed in 2008, Harun said he was innocent of crimes committed in Darfur when he was a minister of state. He claimed the allegations and Sudan’s problems were the product of an international conspiracy, and the ICC was an integral part of it.“It is another phase of international colonisation. It targets mainly the Africans,” he said. “The main aim of the white people in Africa at that time, the British and the Europeans, was to disseminate their culture and their traditions … Now there is a new imperial era, but this time it is led by the United States and supported by the Europeans.”Harun’s suspicious outlook, shared by many in Sudan, underscores the difficulties western countries face in trying to induce Bashir to halt the violence, allow a transitional government of national unity and, perhaps, bow out peacefully.That responsibility may fall to Sudan’s African partners, and Middle Eastern allies such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Turkey. So far there is no sign they will intervene."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ef67d7b5c76f0fd0c86b5b8b7bc5dd19a5e1c42/7_0_4987_2993/master/4987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=750aca4c8d61761d7db03982a8e74c65","title":"us and south korea scrap big military exercises to ease tensions with north","story":"Operations involving thousands of troops have always infuriated PyongyangThe US and South Korea have said they will end their annual large-scale joint military exercises as Washington pursues efforts to improve ties with North Korea.The decision comes days after the conclusion of Donald Trump’s second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, which ended without a formal agreement but with both sides suggesting they would keep talking.The US president has ruled out withdrawing any of the 28,500 US forces based in South Korea to defend it from its nuclear-armed neighbour, which invaded in 1950.Any such drawdown would face strong pushback from the US Congress and Japan, whose conservative government is deeply wary of North Korea’s intentions.But Trump has complained repeatedly over the cost of the military drills, which Pyongyang has always condemned as provocative rehearsals for invasion.During a phone call on Saturday between South Korean defence minister Jeong Kyeong-doo and his US counterpart Patrick Shanahan, “both sides decided to conclude the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle series of exercises, according to a Pentagon statement.Foal Eagle is the biggest of the regular joint exercises held by the allies, and has always infuriated Pyongyang.In the past, it has involved 200,000 South Korean forces and some 30,000 US soldiers.It is accompanied by Key Resolve, a computer-simulated war game conducted by military commanders which usually begins in March and runs for about 10 days.The two allies will instead carry out “adjusted outside manoeuvre trainings and united command exercises to continue firm military readiness”, Seoul’s defence ministry said Sunday.The decision was reached to support ongoing diplomatic efforts for North Korea’s denuclearisation and ease military tensions with the North, it added.Opponents of scrapping the drills have warned that it could impact the combat readiness of the combined US and South Korean forces and hand the North a strategic advantage on the ided peninsula.“Suspending or downgrading the US-South Korean drills may hurt the readiness of the two militaries, but I don’t think it’s going to be a serious security threat to South Korea,” Ahn Chan-il, the president of the World Institute for North Korea Studies in Seoul, told AFP.“The South’s conventional forces outclass the North’s, and given the current situation (with the US and the existing sanctions), it’s highly unlikely that Pyongyang will do anything with its nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future,” he added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3809666.1551458972!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fintan o toole the day the donald became forever the don","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Cohen listens as he finishes a day of testimony to the House Oversight  Committee  in Washington on Wednesday.

What has become of the agencies who should protect life from this? Is everything spent?”He added that “if I were there I would rip those nets down. Do it.”A mystery activist has now removed some of the netting, with the developers claiming whoever vandalised the mesh is responsible for any birds becoming trapped.Campaigners are angry that the netting was installed before North Lincolnshire Council has ruled on whether the development should even go ahead.Councillor Paul McCartan, of Winterton Town Council, said the developers carried out the work so if the application is approved later this month they can begin construction without delay.“This shows a high level of arrogance because before a final decision has even been made they have gone in thinking they are going to win and consequently put up the netting,” he said.“It’s an example of developers riding roughshod over local communities.”He added that the site earmarked for development was inhabited by endangered bats and hedgehogs. The issue has been reported to the RSPCA and RSPB.A spokesman for Partner Construction said the netting was installed by ecologists to ensure birds and other wildlife were not harmed.“Were the scheme to be approved in the next few weeks, it is probable that birds would have begun nesting in the hedge, delaying the project to deliver much needed affordable housing.“So, rather than rip out the hedge, which was an option, we took the environmentally responsible decision to net it.This means, that if the scheme does not receive approval the hedge can be returned to its natural use. Meanwhile there are plenty of other places nearby which are suitable for nesting.“We commissioned properly qualified and experienced ecologists to carry out the work on our behalf. They have assured us and provided photographic evidence there were no birds in the hedgerow after it was netted and that the cover was left in a secure condition, preventing birds from gaining access.“Regrettably, we’ve now seen evidence, through images shared on social media, that the netting has been tampered with and damaged. It has been cut, opened and then closed again with pull ties. Whoever did this is responsible for distress caused to any birds which may have subsequently got inside and become trapped.”More than 200 letters against the application for the homes to be built just south of Winterton have been lodged with the local authority. The application was submitted in September for 40 homes, including 25 affordable properties.Please review our commenting policyShamima Begum\u0026#39s husband says he wants to live in Holland with wife and newborn sonComment: We\u0026#39re teaching our children to be self-soothing sissiesComment: Despite what Corbynistas say, when it comes to tax we\u0026#39re more of a Sweden than a SingaporeComment: I knew Brexit would be a shambles, but I never could have predicted this messTanking economy, Belt and Road unraveling and Huawei: Why China\u0026#39s Xi Jinping faces his toughest year yetComment: Organ donation is a precious act - don\u0026#39t let it become an expected oneUK weather: Storm Freya to batter Britain with 80mph winds House of Lords spent thousands on NDAs for former staff who made allegations of sexual harassment and workplace bullyingUS and South Korea scrap major military exercises to ease tensions with North HS2 plans to sign sweetheart wind farm deals would breach procurement rules, Tory peer warnsComment: British governments have lied about the EU for decades.

south korea scrap major military exercises ease tensions","story":"U.S. Army soldiers from the 25th Infantry Division\u0026#39s 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team and a South Korean Army soldier participate in a demonstration of the combined arms live-fire exercise during the annual joint military exercise Foal EagleThe US and South Korea announced on Sunday an end to their annual large-scale military exercises in support of diplomatic efforts to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme.The decision comes days after the conclusion of US President Donald Trump’s second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, which ended without a formal agreement but with both sides suggesting they would keep talking.There are close to 30,000 US troops stationed in South Korea, and their annual drills with tens of thousands of South Korean soldiers have been a perennial target of North Korean fury – with Pyongyang condemning the manoeuvres as provocative rehearsals for invasion.While Mr Trump has ruled out withdrawing the troops, he has repeatedly complained about the cost of the exercises, describing them at a press conference in Hanoi as very, very expensive.During a Saturday phone call between South Korean Defence Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo and his US counterpart Patrick Shanahan, both sides decided to conclude the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle series of exercises, according to a Pentagon statement.Foal Eagle is the biggest of the regular joint exercises held by the allies.In the past, it has involved 200,000 South Korean forces and some 30,000 US soldiers.It is accompanied by Key Resolve, a computer-simulated war game conducted by military commanders which usually begins in March and runs for about 10 days.The two allies will instead carry out adjusted outside manoeuvre trainings and united command exercises to continue firm military readiness, Seoul’s defence ministry said Sunday.The decision was reached to support ongoing diplomatic efforts for North Korea’s denuclearisation and ease military tensions with the North, it added.South Korea’s foreign ministry said that Lee Do-hoon, Seoul’s chief nuclear envoy, will leave for Washington to hold talks with his US counterpart Stephen Biegun.Lee will fly sometime this week, ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk told AFP.Lee and Biegun are expected to discuss the Hanoi summit, which failed to build on the vaguely-worded commitment to denuclearise the Korean peninsula signed by Kim and Trump during their meeting in Singapore last year.Opponents of scrapping the drills have warned that it could impact the combat readiness of the combined US and South Korean forces and hand the North a strategic advantage on the ided peninsula, but most analysts said such concerns were exaggerated.Suspending or downgrading the US-South Korean drills may hurt the readiness of the two militaries, but I don’t think it’s going to be a serious security threat to South Korea, Ahn Chan-il, the president of the World Institute for North Korea Studies in Seoul, told AFP.U.S. Army\u0026#39s Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters fly during a combined arms live-fire exercise during the annual joint military exercise Foal EagleThe South’s conventional forces outclass the North’s, and given the current situation (with the US and the existing sanctions), it’s highly unlikely that Pyongyang will do anything with its nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future, he added.Retired General Vincent Brooks, a former commander of US forces in South Korea who helped organise Trump’s first meeting with Kim in Singapore, said last year that any end to joint training would not hinder the Pentagon’s combat-readiness on the peninsula.Perhaps we’ve been told for now to put our sword back into its sheath, but we have not been told to forget how to use it, he said.Washington has sought to end long-running tensions on the peninsula and encourage North Korea to scrap its nuclear programme.Since the Singapore summit, the US and Seoul have scaled back or scrapped several joint military drills, and US bombers are no longer flying over South Korea.Not downgrading or suspending the drills at this point ... would mean the involved countries are not serious about reaching a denuclearisation accord, said University of North Korean Studies professor Yang Moo-jin.Please review our commenting

Buffy Sainte-Marie, Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche wrote it for the Richard Gere movie An Officer and A Gentleman. It was sung as a duet after Jennifer Warnes suggested a collaboration with Joe Cocker. Warnes had been a fan of the late Cocker since her teenage years and said she cried out with joy when he accepted the invitation to work with her. Their version was a worldwide hit and also won a Golden Globe and a Grammy.In Swing Time, Fred Astaire sings the gorgeous ballad “The Way You Look Tonight” to Ginger Rogers while she is washing her hair. The sentimental lyrics were written by the brilliant songwriter Dorothy Fields, whose credits include “A Fine Romance” and “The Sunny Side of the Street”. The song, with music composed by Jerome Kern, was up against some terrific competition in 1936 – beating “Pennies from Heaven” and “I’ve Got You Under My Skin” to an award in its third year. Billie Holiday, with jazz maestro Teddy Wilson on piano, had a hit with “The Way You Look Tonight” that year and the song has since been recorded by hundreds of best-selling singers, including Frank Sinatra. “The Way You Look Tonight” is popular, romantic songwriting at its very best.Sammy Fain’s formal love ballads epitomised the style of movie music in the 1950s. Fain won the Academy award for best song twice – for “Secret Love”, from the 1953 Doris Day movie Calamity Jane and, two years later, with the title song for Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing. Fain, a trained pianist, started out as song promoter in the 1920s and he was pragmatic about delivering the song studio bosses wanted for this William Holden movie. Fain and lyricist Paul Francis Webster constantly tinkered with the words in “Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing” to keep 20th Century-Fox happy. The song, performed by The Four Aces on the soundtrack, has remained a favourite of crooners, from Sinatra to Barry Manilow. The song has also been referenced in numerous modern films, including Grease and Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.410 7) “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” (The Lion King 1994)In songwriting terms, it was essentially Elton John v Randy Newman in 1994. Newman was nominated for “Make Up Your Mind” for The Paper and John for three songs from The Lion King (his other nominations were for the songs “The Circle of Life” and “Hakuna Matata”). “Can You Feel the Love Tonight”, co-written with Tim Rice, was a popular winner and the single sold 11 million copies. Canadian Céline Dion’s power ballad “My Heart Will Go On”, the theme song to James Cameron’s hit film Titanic, has been bought more than 20 million times. “My Heart Will Go On” is the romantic ballad playing as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet embrace at the front of the ill-fated liner that crashed into a iceberg. Dion showed great technical skill coping with the tricky modulations of a song written by James Horner and Will Jennings, while the poignant tin-whistle playing is courtesy of Andrea Corr.Top Gun was virtually completed when Tom Whitlock came up with the lyrics to “Take My Breath Away” as he was driving home from work and mulling on a melody Giorgio Moroder had composed. The agreed they had something good and made a demo to play for director Tony Scott. He called back Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis to shoot some new love scenes to go with the new song. “If you see those scenes, you\u0027ll notice that they are lit differently and there are those gauzy curtains blowing around,” Whitlock told rediscoverthe80s “All of that was to disguise that some months had gone by and the actors didn\u0027t look exactly the same.”710 4) “I Just Called to Say I Love You” (The Woman in Red, 1984)In 1984, another year of popular movie title songs (“Ghostbusters” and “Footloose” were in the running), the Oscar went to Stevie Wonder’s “I Just Called to Say I Love You”. Wonder said that he had the late John Lennon in mind for a song he claimed he had first thought of in 1976. “I had the melody and lyric for the chorus, and I imagined in my mind when hearing the chords that The Beatles were singing with me. And that idea and feeling is what inspired me to use the vocoder.” The song was written for the movie The Woman in Red, a mediocre comedy starring Gene Wilder. In 2018, singer-songwriter John Prine recorded a slow, stripped-down version of the song for Spotify Singles, in which he brings out the essential charm of a ballad some find too saccharine. Wonder’s winner was a particular favourite of the writer Maya Angelou810 3) “Moon River” (Breakfast at Tiffany’s, 1961)In Blake Edwards’s film of the Truman Capote novel Breakfast at Tiffany’s, there is a scene in which the love interest Audrey Hepburn sits on the fire escape at a New York apartment and accompanies herself on guitar singing “Moon River”. The scene is charming and the waif-like Hepburn, staying in tune and doing her best with a singing voice that was thin and limited in range, delivers a moving version of a song written for her by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer.The film noir Captain Carey, U.S.A, a tale of revenge set in the aftermath of the Second World War that starred Alan Ladd, is regarded now as a dated dud. Its theme tune “Mona Lisa”, sung by Ukrainian jazz trumpeter and bandleader Charlie Spivak, is the surviving glory of the film, however. It became a global hit when it was covered in 1950 by Nat King Cole. Ray Evans wrote the poignant lyrics – “Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa? Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?” – and realised the song, comparing a lover to the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, would work as a showcase for Cole’s warm baritone voice. Cole’s splendid version was at No.1 for eight weeks. In the year it won, incidentally, “Mona Lisa” beat the Disney novelty song “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” from Cinderella.1010  1) “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” (The Wizard of Oz, 1939)Although “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” is not a straightforward love song, it is a ballad about hope and loving humanity itself, a song that co-writer Yip Harburg called an attempt to “create a rainbow world”, where the dreams you dare to dream really do come true. It was the song Ariana Grande picked to perform at the ‘One Love Manchester’ concert in 2017 for the victims of the terrorist attack. Remarkably, this 20th-century classic, whose melody was composed by Harold Arlen, was almost cut from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, because MGM were worried that the opening Kansas sequence was too long. Sixteen-year-old Judy Garland’s sublime version, orchestrated by Murray Cutter, wowed cinema-goers and the decision to leave it in was vindicated. Lady Gaga sings a brief section of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” in the Oscar-nominated movie A Star is Born.110 10) “Up Where We Belong (An Officer and A Gentleman, 1982)1982 was a year of blockbuster movie songs and “Up Where We Belong” pipped “Eye of the Tiger” to Oscars glory.

Lady Gaga sings a brief section of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” in the Oscar-nominated movie A Star is Born.In the 1850s, he began composing symphonic poems and worked as the conductor of the Gothenburg Philharmonic in Sweden. Over the next decade, Smetana returned to Prague, where his first opera,\u0026nbspBraniboři v Čechách (The Brandenburgers in Bohemia), opened in 1866.A second opera titled\u0026nbspProdaná\u0026nbspNevěsta (The Bartered Bride) followed that same year, bringing success to the composer.Smetana lost his hearing in 1874 as a result of illness (syphilis, per the Encyclopaedia Britannica) but kept working.Between 1874 and 1879, he wrote a series of six tone poems titled\u0026nbspMá Vlast (My Country), which remain known by many to this day.Vltava\u0026nbsp(The Moldau)\u0026nbspembodies Smetana’s love of his hometown and echoes the flow of the\u0026nbspVltava river, also known by its German name Moldau.\u0026nbspTowards the end of his life, Smetana entered a mental health facility in Prague, where he died on 12 May, 1884.In addition to his operas and symphonic poems, Smetana is also celebrated for his highly regarded piano compositions.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are concerns that a hard Brexit could lead to long delays and disruption, with potential for prices to jump and shortages of certain foods. \u0026nbsp“Consumers may see some changes in what is available every week through the year with more space for offers where retailers can respond quickly to opportunities and deliver surprise,” researchers warned.Meanwhile, while retailers have traditionally had very strong rules related to the size, shape and colour of fresh produce items many companies are now changing these rules.“As Brexit draws near, retailers will be rejecting less than ever. Ultimately, this means many shoppers will need to spend extra time learning how to pick their own,” Kantar said. Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.“Overall, this may help retailers accelerate the war on packaging and plastics, on food waste, and on obesity. The only downside is that shopping will take just a little bit longer than before.”Ray Gaul and Fraser McKevitt, who wrote the report, said: “The decision to leave the EU has affected consumers in different ways, but it’s apparent that ongoing uncertainty is already having a definite impact on purchasing trends and behaviours. From a supplier’s perspective, there is little doubt amongst retailers, producers and farmers that Brexit will result in a significant disruption to the UK’s food supply, including unharvested produce and empty supermarket shelves.”British shoppers have also begun to display “several recessionary behaviours” in the run-up to Brexit, according to the research. Consumers are beginning to follow buying patterns last observed during the post-financial crisis recession: the long-term trend of choosing foods for health reasons has “plateaued”, while the number of lunch boxes taken to work by adults has risen. Overall out-of-home food and drink growth has also slowed, reversing the boom of recent years. Brexit is the last straw for young people – so give us a Final SayEU net migration drops to 10-year low ahead of BrexitWhat happens to UK citizens living in the EU under a no-deal Brexit?I’ve resigned my position in the Tory party over Brexit- here’s whyWhile it is difficult to make\u0026nbspdefinitive forecasts about the grocery landscape due to the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit, Kantar said: “The sector faces medium-term challenges around sourcing adequate levels of staff, particularly in London and potentially also in Northern Ireland. “This will disproportionately affect grocery retailers with large portions of their estate in London but may yet be relieved to some extent if UK immigration remains open to EU nationals and even expands to allow easier employment of overseas nationals hailing from beyond the EU.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Levels of snacking have\u0026nbspincreased. More people are taking lunch boxes into work, rather than buying from sandwich shops or the canteen, because it’s cheaper. The eating out boom of recent years has slowed dramatically.\u0026nbspIt appears that the ‘we’ll be alright if we just keep calm and carry on’ propaganda is being taken with a pinch of salt.\u0026nbspEurotunnel settles Brexit ferry contract dispute for £33mLiam Fox mocked for spending £107,000 on Brexit podcastUK supermarkets lowering standards ahead of Brexit, study showsNo wonder. Kantar makes the point that, according to the Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs, in 1988 domestic foods accounted for 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of all of what was consumed in Britain. Today, that figure has fallen to 50 per cent, or half.\u0026nbspMuch of the new consumption has arrived from the European Union, from where 62 per cent of all free foods are imported. In the absence of a deal, or a Brexit delay, in less than a month from now the smooth, uninterrupted flow of that food Britain enjoys through its membership of the single market will come to a juddering halt.\u0026nbspThat’s a big problem because while UK consumers may say they like the idea of buying locally, their buying habits speak otherwise. For example, just 41 per cent of the strawberries bought in Britain are consumed during their June, July and August season. The remainder is imported out of season, some from Europe or North Africa, some from further afield.\u0026nbspRetailers have done their best to respond. Range reviews have been conducted. We don’t tend to notice, but they regularly change through the year. They are changing now in ways they don’t usually change. Imported ranges have, for example, been simplified. Tesco has stated that it didn’t return fridges it rented during Christmas. It and Lidl have said that they’ll be hiring extra customs officials to get their produce fast tracked. Investments have been made in software and logistics planning.\u0026nbspMoney has also been spent on beefing up security too. One of the more specious arguments against a second referendum is it would cause social unrest. A no deal would all but guarantee it. It would brutally expose the lies told by Britain’s politicians.\u0026nbspIt would be remiss of me not to note that there will be some positives, and they may persist if Britain avoids the looming cliff edge. They include supermarkets becoming less likely to reject ‘wonky’ or odd shaped veg (although that was already in train) and their efforts persuade shoppers to eat seasonally. Packaging may reduce, and the top to bottom reviews some retailers have conducted of their businesses will serve them well whatever.\u0026nbspHowever, as a palliative these are rather like taking a paracetamol to deal with the after effects of major surgery.Kantar’s report is a superlative piece of work. Its authors, Fraser McKevitt and Ray Gaul, are to be commended.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.But reading it is faintly surreal. The things they highlight in their report - things that are happening right now - wouldn\u0027t have just been dismissed as ‘Project Fear’ during the EU referendum. They would have been laughed out of town. So Remain didn\u0027t mention them.\u0026nbspThe report further serves to\u0026nbspdemonstrate\u0026nbspthe fallacy of the no dealers simplistic case. Project reality is now fast approaching fast and it\u0027s\u0026nbspeven colder than Tesco’s Fridges. Unless MPs find the courage to act, it will bite hard.

Overnight, it robbed him of his confidence and his work as a commercial tyre fitter. He became housebound, unable even to make a cup of tea, and so depressed that one evening he found himself on a bridge near his home in Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, Wales, contemplating suicide.\u0026nbspThat was four years ago. Now Mr Ricketts is helping other people suffering from disabilities and loneliness with the Llanelli Visually Impaired Bowls Club. The bowls club has flourished since Mr Ricketts founded it in 2016. This year, they are raising money to attend a national championship in Weston-Super-Mare.\u0026nbspMr Ricketts is also working with the local Men’s Sheds\u0026nbspcharity and\u0026nbspStreet Buddies, a volunteer scheme for residents to get involved in the community. For some of this work, he is paid in time credits, a form of community currency that can be exchanged for tickets to concerts and access to parks and leisure centres.“It’s given me a real boost,” he says. “It’s a way to pay people for help without using money and it makes me feel really good, because I’m giving something back.”What is Venezuela’s new currency system?The stock exchange for goods and skills in GlasgowTime credits in the UK are issued by Tempo (formerly known as Spice). The charity was founded in 2008 at the the Wales Institute for Community Currencies. In their original form, time credits were an experiment to help rebuild\u0026nbspthe ex-mining communities of south Wales.Time credits offer an alternative way to reward work that is traditionally unpaid at a time when local authorities are relying on communities to step in and provide care for the lonely and vulnerable. They should never replace paid work, but time credits\u0026nbspmight give meaning or value to an exchange with a person with disabilities, mental health or addiction issues who could struggle to take part in the monetary economy.\u0026nbspIn times of crisis, such as in Argentina at the turn of the millennium or during the Greek financial crisis, barter economies and community currencies can facilitate exchanges between people when the monetary economy fails. \u0026nbspSome 50,000 people have since earned 700,000 time credits since 2008. Mr Ricketts says the scheme has huge potential in areas of low income by helping community groups give back to volunteers. Families awarded time credits can use the scheme to take advantage of daytrips and leisure activities that might otherwise be beyond their reach.\u0026nbsp“I have seen the potential of them for families with low incomes,” he says. He has been known to give some of his own time credits to people when he sees them counting the pennies to buy a cup of tea.\u0026nbspMr Ricketts always keeps some time credits in his pockets. Given his condition, that can cause confusion. “They look and feel like the new plastic fivers,” he says. “Because I can’t see I have been known to try and pay for a pint with time credits in the pub.”Similar schemes around the UK encourage people to swap their time or labour for time in kind. In Hull, the HullCoin rewards people for getting involved in community action with a digital currency that can be used to get discounts with local businesses. Many cities also have a time-banking network co-ordinated by Timebanking UK. Time-banking is rooted in the idea that every person has something to contribute to their community, regardless of their circumstances.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

He says time credits are a way to enable people like Stephen Ricketts to take a role in their community by recognising the efforts that go into volunteering. The scheme also gets new people into volunteering. Half of people earning time credits have have volunteered before.“People volunteer for its own sake and that’s fine,” Mr Merrill says. “But we know that time credits bring people into volunteering who wouldn’t already do it.”\u0026nbspMr Ricketts says he uses time credits at bowls to thank personal assistants for extra jobs, like making a round of tea, putting out biscuits for the players, or cleaning up afterwards. “After a bit of time, I found out the assistants had children and they were taking them swimming, so when they wanted to take their family out to a leisure part or a theatre, I gave them the time credits to cover it,” he says.Volunteers can currently spend their time credits golfing at Pembrey Park in Wales, learning to paddleboard in Essex, or on hair and beauty treatments at participating salons. They can also be exchanged for short courses at some college and classes to learn how to act or how to cook healthier meals.What really forces currency markets and exchange rates to change?Simon, whose last name is withheld, earned his first time credits with the Haringey Project, which helps people with mental health problems or substance misuse. He earned credits volunteering with gardening when he lived in St Mungo’s Hostel for two years. With the credits he earned, he took his mother on outings to Tower Bridge, Keat’s House and Kensington Palace.\u0026nbsp“I’ve taken my mum to places she’s never been to before,” he says. “I went on lots of trips with time credits this August, it was the best August of my whole life.”Tempo is now looking at harnessing technology to bring time credits to more people. Mr Merrill says time credits could become ever more important in the UK during tightened economic circumstances. “Time credits enables people to address needs in their own communities,” he says. “If they can help unlock capacity and create connections that weren’t there before, those are good things.We’ll tell you what’s true.

There are concerns that a hard Brexit could lead to long delays and disruption, with potential for prices to jump and shortages of certain foods. \u0026nbsp“Consumers may see some changes in what is available every week through the year with more space for offers where retailers can respond quickly to opportunities and deliver surprise,” researchers warned.Meanwhile, while retailers have traditionally had very strong rules related to the size, shape and colour of fresh produce items many companies are now changing these rules.“As Brexit draws near, retailers will be rejecting less than ever. Ultimately, this means many shoppers will need to spend extra time learning how to pick their own,” Kantar said. Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.“Overall, this may help retailers accelerate the war on packaging and plastics, on food waste, and on obesity. The only downside is that shopping will take just a little bit longer than before.”Ray Gaul and Fraser McKevitt, who wrote the report, said: “The decision to leave the EU has affected consumers in different ways, but it’s apparent that ongoing uncertainty is already having a definite impact on purchasing trends and behaviours. From a supplier’s perspective, there is little doubt amongst retailers, producers and farmers that Brexit will result in a significant disruption to the UK’s food supply, including unharvested produce and empty supermarket shelves.”British shoppers have also begun to display “several recessionary behaviours” in the run-up to Brexit, according to the research. Consumers are beginning to follow buying patterns last observed during the post-financial crisis recession: the long-term trend of choosing foods for health reasons has “plateaued”, while the number of lunch boxes taken to work by adults has risen. Overall out-of-home food and drink growth has also slowed, reversing the boom of recent years.

He told me he had once picked up a distressed woman from a nightclub, late at night, and she told him she had just been sexually assaulted by a north African immigrant.After taking a few moments to digest this, I asked the obvious question: “But what’s that got to do with Brexit?” He had barely begun answering before he accidentally drove through a red light, triggering a camera flash. This was going to cost him.\u0026nbspFor an Australian, getting to understand Brexit has been a process of getting to understand the English. I had a slight advantage on some of my compatriots. I was born in England, though my family moved to seek sun, sand and work after the winter of discontent in 1978-79 when I was a child.\u0026nbspI retain enough Englishness (and English relatives) to appreciate the lingering distrust of the continent and its people, the instinctive rejection of the post-war plan for all Europe to join in an ode to joy and brotherhood.

Australia is one of the world’s biggest fans of trade deals. As a self-aware “middle power”, we know that we prosper through alliances. We have few empire romances to fall back on (though we have the Commonwealth\u0026nbspmore of that later). We instinctively seek to draw ourselves closer to our neighbours, friends and trading partners through deals and forums.\u0026nbspFarage (AFPGetty)The sight of a country deliberately throwing away a close, mutually beneficial partnership, wilfully damaging its economy and influence on a point of cultural principle, was a surprise.From the start there was an immediate interest from our readers – reflected in the below-the-article arguments and in article click-throughs. I soon found myself writing seemingly endless updates, analysis pieces and weekend news reads on this technical, political spasm on the other side of the world.In the pre-Trump era Brexit was the international focus for a global trend: the rise of nationalism, the disillusionment with globalism, the fear of “uncontrolled”\u0026nbspmigration.\u0026nbspThese factors have been playing out in Australia too, though with different timing and emphasis.\u0026nbspWe managed to make it through the financial crisis more or less unscathed, so the economic triggers for Brexit were alien to us, or at least less relatable.As tensions rise with China, Brexit seems more dangerous than ever Australian salaries are high and public services pretty robust. But our housing availabilityaffordability bubble is as bad as Britain’s, with similar knock-on effects for quality of life.\u0026nbspOur migration “crisis”\u0026nbspcame in 2001, with a surge in the numbers of asylum seekers trying to reach Australia by boat. Our then centrist, populist prime minister John Howard seized the moment to proclaim: “We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.”It was a resonant phrase. Like the best political slogans it was impossible to argue with, defending controversial politics with impenetrable rhetoric.\u0026nbspWhen Australians heard the Brexiteer slogan “take back control”\u0026nbspwe immediately recognised what was going on.Australia hopes to be the first cab off the rank for a post-Brexit free trade deal. We’ve a lot of recent experience in getting them done fastDavid Cameron could have taken a leaf from Howard’s playbook. When Howard was confronted with an irresistible push for a referendum in the late Nineties (on Australia becoming a republic, which Howard strongly opposed), he responded with a process ingeniously designed to undermine it: first, a national convention to agree on a model that was inevitably going to be a compromise nobody liked, then a vote in which half the people who wanted a republic would vote against it because it wasn’t the republic they had imagined. Sadly, Howard didn’t offer this advice or Cameron didn’t seek it.So the campaign began. As a foreign correspondent I rarely had to report the daily tennis match. This avoided much of the problem faced by domestic media: the failure of “he said, she said”\u0026nbspjournalism when confronted with daily exaggerations and concoctions from campaigners, and the rejection of expertise.\u0026nbspInstead, my editors wanted to know what was driving public opinion. Not quite a forecast of the result, but understanding of, whichever way it fell, why it had fallen that way.My initial theory was that it would shake out much like the 2014 Scottish referendum. It was to be nationalistic passion and vague promises of future benefits, up against a well-organised steamrolling campaign of warnings about the inevitable costs and risks.Farage says he would rather \u0027go on holiday\u0027 than vote in a second Brexit referendumThe sight of a country deliberately throwing away a close, mutually beneficial partnership, wilfully damaging its economy and influence on a point of cultural principle, was a surpriseBut then I met an insightful\u0026nbspBrussels thinktank chief, whose depressing logic completely changed my mind.\u0026nbspFabian Zuleeg told me the above theory was “plausible… but not one I believe in”. He asked the simple question: “Who’s going to campaign against Brexit?”Business would be reticent, worried about spooking shareholders. Much of the media were scathingly Eurosceptic. Trade unions were never really on board with the EU. Labour was ided. Cameron was on the nose with voters and had for years (like many of his colleagues) used the EU and immigration as a political punch bag. On the other side were figures like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage: stump speakers with mass appeal. I’d met Farage. I understood why he was political catnip.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite frightening,” the thinktank chief said. “If you look at the general attitudes towards migration (in the UK) it’s intensely negative and I think this is going to drive a lot of this agenda.”For an Australian to lecture the UK on political self-harm is, of course, the height of hypocrisy. We’ve changed prime ministers six times in the past 11 years, only twice as the result of an election, and we’re quite likely to do it again in 2019. And if any country is going to sympathise with a nation torn by an endless debate over migration, it’s Australia.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the referendum, though, then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull channelled the mood of much of our country: bemused tolerance.\u0026nbsp“If the British people, in their wisdom, decide to stay in the European Union then we would welcome that,” he said a month or so ahead of the vote.\u0026nbspTheresa May to meet opposition leaders as Labour snubs offer of talks More than 170 business leaders urge May to back second referendumCorbyn will do no better than May when it comes to BrexitThere was self-interest too, Turnbull said. Australian businesses like to base in the UK and take advantage of access to the EU.\u0026nbspAnd Australia as a member of the Five Eyes group, sharing intelligence with the UK, felt from a security point of view it was “an unalloyed plus for Britain to remain in the EU”.Then came the vote.\u0026nbsp“We respect the wishes of the British people,” Turnbull said afterwards. Rather optimistically, he added: “I have no doubt that in due course, the British government will negotiate a satisfactory departure from the European Union.”Privately, he held a different view. After being deposed, at a private speech in November 2018, Turnbull said what he really thought.\u0026nbspBrexit was a “catastrophe”, he said – a decision “not even understood by the government, let alone by the people. It was absolutely uninformed consent.”Nevertheless, a significant faction of conservative Australian politics\u0026nbsp(including the then high commissioner in London) threw itself\u0026nbspenthusiastically behind Brexit.\u0026nbspSince the vote, then, our official attitude has essentially been:\u0026nbsp“Ok, what’s in it for us?”\u0026nbspMost obviously, there’s a trade deal. Australia hopes to be the first cab off the rank for a post-Brexit free trade deal. We’ve a lot of recent experience in getting them done fast.\u0026nbspWe’re a relatively minor trading partner for the UK (compared with, say, the US), so there’s less at stake and the UK can use us as a kind of training ground before it takes on the ruthless brainboxes from Washington DC. And there’s the Commonwealth link. Brexiteers imagined Commonwealth ties as a\u0026nbspbasis for post-Brexit UK’s international identity.\u0026nbspAustralia is happy to play along with this, especially as Brexiteers seem to think the Commonwealth consists entirely of Australia, New Zealand and Canada.And, finally, it feels like a historical revenge served cold. When the UK joined the EU it triggered a dramatic change in UK-AU trade.\u0026nbspWe lost a market, and it forced us to refocus on our region. In a way it was a favour: Australia prospered hugely from its growing ties to the developing economies to our north.\u0026nbsp But some (especially the older, more Anglophile corner of conservative politics) have never forgotten this slight. When Britain comes begging for post-Brexit favours, it will be a sweet moment indeed.Nick Miller has been the Europe correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, based in London, since 2013We’ll tell you what’s true.

Actually, it’s a two-man show: most of the landscape paintings in this exhibition are by David Hockney, but they’re juxtaposed with landscapes by one of his great artistic heroes: Vincent van Gogh.“He’s one of the great, great draughtsmen of all time,”Hockney, fielding questions from a crowd of journalists, who’ve flown in from all around the world. “The drawings are fantastic – he could see space very clearly.” And the paintings are something else. “Van Gogh is telling us that there’s a marvellous world in your own back garden. You just have to look at it – really look. I think that’s his message. It’s thrilling if you really look.”Hockney is wearing a natty flat cap and a lime green cardigan – he’s always been a stylish dresser. He seems cheerful and contented – he’s always been comfortable in his own skin. However he looks older and frailer than he did a few years ago, and he talks a lot more slowly. This should come as no surprise – he is 81, after all – but somehow it’s still a shock. With his boyish good looks, he was the Peter Pan of Pop Art. Even in late middle age, he seemed a lot younger than his years. Now he finally looks his age, but we should be thankful he’s still alive and still painting. If Van Gogh had lived as long as Hockney, he would have still been alive in the 1930s.“I’ve been deeply influenced by Van Gogh – it’s very visible in this show,” he says. “Van Gogh, to me, is a contemporary artist. Any artist that speaks to you is a contemporary artist. Brueghel is a contemporary artist to me.” Another big influence in his life has been Van Gogh’s letters to his brother Theo. “They’re marvellous,” he says. “If it had been 10 years later he might have been on the phone and the letters wouldn’t exist.”Hockney’s first encounter with Van Gogh was back in 1955, when he was a student at Bradford School of Art. The art school arranged a trip to a Van Gogh exhibition in Manchester, and Hockney was blown away by the energy, the vitality, the joie de vivre of his paintings. “I was 16 years old and I’d just started at the art school,” he recalls. “I thought, ‘Well, he’s quite a rich artist, because he could use two whole tubes of blue to paint the sky’. Not even teachers at the art school could afford that!”Created with Sketch.David Hockney\u0027s first brushes with genius Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hockney (right) at the Walker Art Gallery with Sir John Moores in 1967‘Cold Water About to Hit the Prince’ (1969)‘Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool’ (1966)Hockney’s entry form for the 1967 John Moores Painting Prize‘Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness’ (1965)Hockney (right) at the Walker Art Gallery with Sir John Moores in 1967‘Cold Water About to Hit the Prince’ (1969)‘Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool’ (1966)Hockney’s entry form for the 1967 John Moores Painting Prize‘Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness’ (1965)It was the colour that moved him most of all. “I’d never seen paintings like that before – at the art school everybody just painted grey pictures of Bradford. There was not much colour at all. At first I thought he’d probably exaggerated some colour, but now I don’t think so.” Sixty-four years later, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world’s largest collection of Van Gogh’s work, has had the bright idea of juxtaposing a large array of Hockney’s Yorkshire landscape paintings with a smaller selection of Van Gogh’s landscapes, painted in the 1880s in the south of France. Hockney is flattered by this association. “Van Gogh is a terrific inspiration.”Of course there are some similarities between Van Gogh’s woods and wheat fields and Hockney’s, but this show isn’t about narrow comparisons, of style or subject matter. It’s about their shared love of light. Above all, it’s about their lust for life. They’re both artists who adore the natural world, and paint it compulsively. “They’re just so joyful,” he says, of Van Gogh’s landscapes. You could say the same of his. Fittingly, the show is called The Joy of Nature.As Hockney says, it’s a far better title than Dave and Vince. It’s ironic that such joyful paintings were made by a man who chose to kill himself, but that paradox is part of what makes Van Gogh so compelling. “He was joyful when he painted – I know that, because that’s what he loved.”‘Kilham to Langtoft II’, 27 July 2005, oil on canvas (David Hockney)This exhibition also represents a kind of renaissance, for Hockney’s landscape paintings, like Van Gogh’s, were cut short by a tragic, self-inflicted death. In March 2013, one of Hockney’s assistants, Dominic Elliott, died from drinking toilet cleaner in Hockney’s home in Bridlington, the Yorkshire seaside town where Hockney had been living intermittently since the early Noughties. Hockney was entirely blameless, but he’d been asleep in the house when it happened, and the shock was immense. He sold the house and moved back to Los Angeles, his adopted home for the past 30 years. For several months, he was unable to paint at all.In July 2013 Hockney sent a picture to his friend and curator Edith Devaney. It was a portrait of his close friend and studio manager, Jean-Pierre Goncalves de Lima, sitting in Hockney’s LA studio, his head buried in his hands. Straight away, Devaney spotted the similarity with Van Gogh’s Old Man in Sorrow. This wasn’t just a portrait, Hockney told her – it was also a sort of self-portrait.This portrait led to many more, and the result was his 2016 exhibition, 82 Portraits and One Still Life, at London’s Royal Academy, curated by Devaney. After the trauma of Elliot’s sudden death, Van Gogh helped to bring Hockney back into painting. And now Van Gogh has brought his Yorkshire landscapes, cruelly curtailed by that tragic accident, back to life.Van Gogh is telling us that there’s a marvellous world in your own back garden. You just have to look at it – really look. I think that’s his message. It’s thrilling if you really lookThe selection was mainly made by the Van Gogh Museum, but Hockney did ask them to include The Road to York through Sledmere, which he painted a decade earlier, as homage to his friend Jonathan Silver. Silver revived Salts Mill in Saltaire, Yorkshire, as a cultural centre (and as a museum of Hockney’s work). He died of pancreatic cancer in 1997, aged just 48. When Silver was very ill, Hockney spent a lot of time with him.He asked Silver if there was anything he could do for him. Silver asked him to paint east Yorkshire – a subtler landscape than West Yorkshire, where Hockney was born and raised. “That picture was painted when Jonathan Silver was dying, and I was driving constantly from Bridlington to Saltaire, and I always went through Sledmere,” remembers Hockney. “It’s always been on my wall.”English landscape paintings are often muted, a blur of browns and greys. Hockney’s English landscapes are glowing – bursting with bright colours and brilliant light. “I’d lived in California for 30 years. It’s bound to have an effect. But I don’t think I exaggerated the colour that much – no, I don’t think so. I think it’s there, but you have to look – hard. Colour is a very fugitive thing.”As he says, we all see colour differently. Some people see it more intensely. Hockney’s intense vision makes us look closer and the world look brighter. “When you’re looking at the world, there’s so much to see.”David Hockney was born in Bradford in 1937, the fourth of five children. During the war his father Kenneth was a conscientious objector, which meant that when he lost his job, as a clerk, he wasn’t eligible for national assistance. He subsequently scratched a living renovating old prams. David drew from an early age, in chalk on the kitchen floor and in pencil in his brothers’ comics.In 1947 he won a scholarship to Bradford Grammar School. He didn’t shine at school, which was just as well. If he’d been top of the class his teachers might have pushed him into a more respectable occupation. “He should realise that ability in and enthusiasm for art alone is not enough to make a career for him,” wrote his teacher on his school report.Fortunately for Hockney, and the rest of us, he paid no attention to his teachers. He went to Bradford College of Art, which gave him a solid foundation in skills like life drawing, then on to the Royal College of Art, in London, where he found his voice. He came out as gay – a brave move in an era when homosexuality was still illegal – and his work blossomed. He made his first visit to America, and returned with his hair dyed blonde, after seeing a TV ad for Clairol which claimed that “blondes have more fun”.By the time Hockney left the Royal College he was already represented by a Bond Street gallery. He moved into a two-room flat in London’s Notting Hill, still a rundown area back then. He slept in one room and used the other room as his studio. His immense talent was bolstered by his insatiable appetite for hard work. GET UP AND WORK IMMEDIATELY was painted in big block capitals on the chest of drawers at the foot of his bed.His first solo show in 1963 earned him enough money to spend a year in America. As he told his friend Henry Geldzahler, he never felt lonely over there. He spent some time in New York but he was drawn to Los Angeles, where he’s lived, off and on, ever since.“Southern California has a marvellous clarity in the light. That’s why Hollywood is there. I always loved the place. I never got bored of it.” The sun-drenched pictures he painted there would have been inconceivable in Britain. “In a cold place like Bradford you hardly see anybody without their clothes on,” he once remarked.Hockney painting ‘May Blossom on the Roman Road’, 2009 (Jean-Pierre Goncalves de Lima)Then as now, LA is commonly derided by snobbish Brits (and New Yorkers) as a spiritual desert, devoid of culture, but Hockney saw a vivid, lively cityscape that no one else had painted, a city with “the only architecture in the world that makes you smile”. He took to calling himself an “English Los Angeleno”. He vowed to become the “Pirinesi of LA”.His LA paintings made his name, in Britain and America, particularly his swimming pool pictures like A Bigger Splash and Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which last year became the most expensive painting by a living artist when it sold at Christie’s in New York for $90m (£68m).David Hockney interview: \u0027I thought I was a peripheral artist, really\u0027“The auction prices for my work have nothing to do with me – I ignore it,” he says, emphatically. “I think people have forgotten Oscar Wilde’s remark, ‘The only person who likes all kinds of art is an auctioneer’.”He’s worked in all kinds of media, from film and photography to set design. He’s embraced every new innovation, from fax machines to smartphones. His iPad paintings were groundbreaking, proving that this new medium could be a new way to make great art.“The first things I did were lots of sunrises from a window, and I realised that with the iPad I could draw without moving from my bed. I didn’t have to get up to get water, or a brush, or pencils, and I could draw in the dark, because of the back light, so I started drawing just before the dawn.” He painted dozens of pictures of the sun rising, on his iPad, through the same bedroom window. “Every day was different, different colours. No two sunrises are the same.”Woldgate’, 2008, oil on 2 canvases (David Hockney)Yet despite his love of hi-tech, he’ll always be remembered as a painter, and a traditional painter at that. “Modern art generally ignores skills and crafts,” he once said, in an interview with Art Monthly. When abstract art was all the rage he flew the flag for figuration. When conceptual art was all the rage he flew the flag for fine art.“There’s a lot of the boring old northern art schoolmaster in what he says about representation versus abstraction,” wrote Tim Hilton, in . But as a new generation of artists rediscover draughtsmanship, it seems Hockney has been proved right.Despite his conventional views on art, he’s no reactionary fuddy-duddy. He was a tireless advocate for gay rights, long before such causes became chic. His friend Henry Geldzahler once wrote down a list of his faults and failings: stubborn hard of hearing unintentionally rude suffers fools gladly generous to a fault. It’s notable that several of these faults are actually virtues.It’s hard to find an artist who’s so universally admired. And after all these years, his hunger for experience remains. “On Saturday I’m going off to Normandy to paint the arrival of spring,” he says. “I can’t think of anything better than watching the spring happen in Normandy in 2019.”Hockney – Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature is at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (vangoghmuseum.nl) until 26 MayWe’ll tell you what’s true.

AI is everywhere, its proponents claim – if it\u0027s not somewhere already, then it\u0027s about to be.And the latest place it has arrived is perhaps the most personal yet: in your mouth. Oral B\u0027s latest toothbrush hopes to bring the power of AI and machine learning to your teeth, using artificial intelligence to coach you into brushing your teeth better.It\u0027s not the first toothbrush to use technology usually preserved for mobile phones and other gadgets to make sure your brushing is as effective as possible. But Oral-B thinks it is the smartest, and the brush has a fitting name: the Genius X.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe toothbrush was revealed in Barcelona this week at Mobile World Congress, an event usually focused on phones. This year, many of the exhibitions focused on foldable handsets and 5G.Oral-B staked its claim not only on the basis of its smart toothbrush but also its general vision of the future of healthcare and its connection to dental hygiene. That vision included a full-scale smart mirror, which could be controlled by people\u0027s hand movements and showed information about the day to come and the overall health of the person using it.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightOral-B does already have a toothbrush that relies on some smart features: the Genius. That too operates as a brushing coach as well as a brush itself, watching how you clean your teeth and encouraging you to avoid bad habits and ensure your entire mouth is brushed.Scientists developing toothbrush to diagnose deadly heart problemsTo know where it is, the toothbrush uses built-in sensors that build on a host of experimental work to understand how people brush. The company put huge numbers of people in front of a camera and asked them to brush, feeding that information into an algorithm that allows the toothbrush to know where it is, no matter which of the widely varying ways of brushing their teeth that people use.But it does so using your phone\u0027s camera, meaning that you have to stick a special holder\u0026nbspto your mirror and then stick your phone inside. When it\u0027s there, it can watch the brush as it moves around in your mouth, monitoring where exactly you are brushing and where needs extra work.That is a rather complicated process that requires a fairly complicated process just to brush your teeth, and might not always work if the phone doesn\u0027t have the right view. Instead, the Genius removes some of that: it just needs to be within Bluetooth distance of your phone, and then will relay information that is displayed on your handset.In the app – which was available to use at MWC, in a booth that let visitors brush their teeth – all of that information is displayed. Brushers are given a score, which factors in whether they press too hard and how long they brush for as well as how effective and complete their coverage was.Over time, people are encouraged to improve that score by better brushing their teeth. Those scores can be viewed historically through the app, which also keeps data on things such as how often your gums bleed.The Genius X is due to be released later this year and pricing has not yet been announced.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Due to a lack of knowledge about the past climate of Mars, scientists\u0026nbspcan not tell whether it came from\u0026nbspgroundwater, precipitation,\u0026nbspmelting glaciers or something unheard of.There is no liquid water on the surface of mars today, though plenty of similar ex-water features\u0026nbsphave been discovered in recent years, suggesting Mars once had a far wetter and warmer climate.Each discovery raises further questions about the planet\u0027s past atmosphere and\u0026nbspscientists ultimately want to know whether or not it would have been suitable for life.Next year the ESA in collaboration with Russia’s space program Roscomos will launch the ExoMars mission with the primary goal to “address the question of whether life has ever existed on Mars.Here The Independent has collated images\u0026nbspfrom recently discovered evidence of water on Mars in the gallery above.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Ms Wong made the discovery after coming across\u0026nbspthe words “Hide Tweet” in the app’s code, which Twitter later confirmed to be the new feature.“Thanks to Jane and @MattNavarra for starting the conversation about this feature we are developing. We wanted to provide a little more context on it,” Twitter’s senior product manager Yasmeen Haq\u0026nbspwrote on Twitter.“We often hear from heavy Tweeters that they want to be able to protect their conversations. People who start interesting conversations on Twitter are really important to us, and we want to empower them to make the conversations they start as healthy as possible by giving them some control.”Twitter is secretly keeping hold of deleted DMsTwitter is ‘thinking about’ a new edit featureMs Haq\u0026nbspexplained how Twitter categorises\u0026nbspconversations as an ecosystem containing\u0026nbspfour different groups: Authors, repliers, the audience and the platform. “We try to balance the experience across all four groups, and we are continuously exploring ways to shift the balance without overcorrecting.”She added: “We think the transparency of the hidden replies would allow the community to notice and call out situations where people use the feature to hide content they disagree with.“We think this can balance the product experience between the original Tweeter and the audience.”Twitter said it planned\u0026nbspto start testing the new Hide Tweet feature publicly “in the coming months”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I felt like I was there again... And I wanted to die. I wanted to die.”Paul Douglas had been in Colnbrook removal centre for a matter of days when he was ordered to pack up to get on a charter flight. The words set him into panic mode. He locked his door and began to cut his wrists. All he could see was the vision of his aunt getting shot dead in the street 20 years before – after she too was deported back to Jamaica.The officers eventually broke into the 30-year-old’s cell and found him unconscious in a pool of blood. Instead of being driven to the flight on 4 February, he was rushed to hospital where he got 22 stitches. After several days, he was discharged and taken straight back to detention – where he is still subject to removal.Paul was just nine when he witnessed his aunt’s murder. With neither of his parents around, she had been his main carer until she was forced to flee to England after becoming a target of the gang warfare that dominated their local area. But the Home Office refused her asylum claim and sent her back – and days after returning she was shot dead.Dozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since WindrushGrowing up in a Kingston neighbourhood with one of the highest crime rates on the island, death was nothing new to Paul. “On the way to school I’d see dead bodies,” he recalls.\u0026nbsp“You’d hear gunshots\u0026nbspbut you became immune to it. When you’re living in and around it, you find a way. I learned to close my eyes and pretend I was in a better place.”But the murder\u0026nbspof his aunt\u0026nbspwas the wakeup call for his relatives –\u0026nbspand when their home was shot at weeks after the murder, they decided to place Paul on a flight destined for the UK.Despite the painful memories, Paul quickly settled into life in London\u0026nbspand began to flourish, excelling academically and seizing on opportunities to learn. He achieved good grades in his GCSEs and was planning to study engineering at college.At the age of 16, though, he was wrenched back to the violence and death he witnessed in his formative years. An altercation with another teenager that began at school – which Paul says he had not wanted to take part in – escalated into a street fight between two groups. During the fracas, a 16-year-old was fatally stabbed.The judge acknowledged Paul did not strike the fatal blow, but the jury decided he and two other boys were jointly responsible. Paul was sentenced to 12 years in jail for “joint enterprise”.“We went from aspiring young boys\u0026nbspto black boys in a gang,” he says. “There was a lot of talk of gang culture during the trial. That was the last thing I wanted.“Coming from such a violent place, I always used to say when I was growing up that I never wanted to be like the people I grew up around. I tried so hard. I never engaged in violence. Up until this point I had never been arrested. I was trying to get somewhere in my life.”Despite the devastation and anger that came with knowing he would be spending the rest of his youth and much of his early adulthood in jail, Paul’s empathy for the victim’s family helped him come to terms with his fate.“Regardless of the situation, someone lost their life,” he says. “I had to think about the boy’s family – a mum, a dad, sisters, brothers. They were suffering. I had to put myself in their position to understand. In this situation there were no winners.”He decided to try to take a positive approach to prison, continuing\u0026nbsphis education behind bars\u0026nbspas well as successfully engaging\u0026nbspin rehabilitation programmes and acting as\u0026nbspa mentor for younger inmates.“There was a lot of emotion. At the time I was young. You just see your future disappear. I knew I wouldn’t be able to experience a lot of things that young people my age did.\u0026nbspI was angry at the system, but I found that that got me nowhere. I couldn’t argue against it. You have to learn to just get on with it.”ColnbrookFourteen years on, after completing his sentence with a glowing report from the parole board, Paul was\u0026nbspsetting up a home to share with his pregnant\u0026nbspgirlfriend, Chanel\u0026nbspGebon,\u0026nbspin time for the birth of their first child.But his\u0026nbsplong-awaited freedom was\u0026nbspcut short when he was detained by the Home Office for the first time on the day he was supposed to be attending his unborn daughter’s ultrasound scan. He was taken to Colnbrook, where he was later told he was to be deported to Jamaica.Chanel, 28, who is a British national, says losing\u0026nbspPaul just before\u0026nbspgiving birth\u0026nbsppushed her into a “dark place”. A week or so after he was\u0026nbspdetained, she went into labour.“It was something we’d always been talking about, how the birth would be. We were really looking forward to the moment,” she\u0026nbspsays. “But I had to do it all without him – just hearing his voice on the end of the phone. It was horrible.“Everything we had planned was positive. Paul\u0026nbspisn’t someone who would want to hurt or upset anyone at all. From the moment he came out, he’s been supportive to so many people. He’s done his time. He’s a lot more mature now – he has goals. Everyone deserves a second chance.”Her words are echoed by\u0026nbspSonya Russo, director of offender behaviour programme Plan B, who worked with Paul during his jail term until the present day, and\u0026nbspwas on the phone to him while he was self-harming in his cell after hearing about\u0026nbspthe charter flight. She\u0026nbspsays the 30-year-old is an “absolute asset” to the community.“Paul has turned things around and survived a 12-year sentence,” Sonya adds. “He has a big impact in the work we do, because he’s obviously relatable to the boys that we teach. What’s happening to him is just awful. Especially his current condition.”Volunteering with the\u0026nbspcharity, Paul has supported young men who have been released from jail, helped them settle\u0026nbspback into the community, and\u0026nbspadvised prison governors about the best way\u0026nbspof teaching inmates – as well as working\u0026nbspwith child victims of the\u0026nbspGrenfell\u0026nbspTower fire.“We’ve got a full-time job for him as soon as we’re allowed to employ him,” says Sonya.\u0026nbsp“He\u0026nbspsettled into a new life after prison and then boom, he’s back in these conditions again – it’s like he’s gone full circle. Since he was a small child he’s had it rough, and he’s losing hope that he’s ever going to be OK.”Home secretary urged to apologise over ‘serious crime’ deportee claimsDespite initial claims by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, that\u0026nbspdeportees were all guilty of “very serious crimes” such as murder and rape, Paul was among a minority of them who had actually been convicted of such an offence.\u0026nbspBut even in his case the\u0026nbspfacts point to a more complex story. The 30-year-old is reduced to tears when he talks about his threat of deportation.“Everything was good. I was finally getting the opportunity to almost live my life. To be suddenly picked up like this and be in this position, I’m mindblown,” says Paul. “I got released by a High Court judge. The judge deemed me not a risk to the public. I walked out of prison with my bags on my back.“Working with young offenders\u0026nbspmade me feel some kind of purpose. I changed some kids’ lives dramatically after speaking to them.\u0026nbspBut they\u0026nbspjust look at what’s on paper. They say they need to protect the public because this person is very dangerous, but they don’t look at the facts. No one wants\u0026nbspto listen.”Harking back to his aunt’s murder,\u0026nbspwhich came flooding back to him when immigration officers came to put him on a flight back to Jamaica, leading him to cut his wrists,\u0026nbspPaul says openly:\u0026nbsp“That wasn’t self-harm. I wanted to kill myself.“The Home Office was told my aunty was at risk of death, but they removed her and allowed it to happen. Now I am in the same position, showing them all the records and everything. It’s like there are\u0026nbspno lessons learned.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“Mr Douglas has no legal right to remain in the UK and has been convicted of murder.“The law requires that we seek to deport foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK. This ensures we keep the public safe.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

There would have to be an extension that would be called ‘motivated’ or ‘technical’.Asked if an extension to Article 50 was the only option if a Brexit deal is to be finalised,\u0026nbsphe answered: “Yes, you could\u0026nbspsay that.”Mr Barnier said the EU would most likely agree to such an extension, but that member states\u0026nbspwould need to be convinced\u0026nbspthere was a good reason for it.\u0026nbspHe said: “The hypothetical duration would depend on what they want it for. I know there is the idea of ​​an extension without conditions, but you have to know\u0026nbspthat an extension would serve to fix a problem, not to delay the solution.“In my opinion, do not postpone the problem for three or six months, do not risk prolonging the general uncertainty of Europe beyond the elections, but it will be for the heads of state to respond.”Ms May’s hopes of securing the Commons’ backing for her deal rest on obtaining\u0026nbspfresh concessions from the EU on the backstop – the main source of opposition from Tory Brexiteers.Grayling faces parliamentary inquiries amid fresh calls to resignStephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, and Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, have been locked in talks with Brussels in a bid to secure legally binding guarantees that the backstop, which would see the UK enter into a customs union with the EU if a trade deal cannot be agreed, would be temporary.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Barnier said Brussels was open to giving further assurances that this is the case.\u0026nbspHe said: “We know that there are misgivings in Britain that the backstop could keep Britain forever connected to the EU.“This is not the case. And we are ready to give further guarantees, assurances and clarifications that the backstop should only be temporary.”He announced that the EU is considering providing the new guarantees in a\u0026nbspjoint\u0026nbspinterpretative document –\u0026nbspan add-on to the withdrawal agreement – saying this could enshrine assurances made in a letter from Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, in January.\u0026nbspMr Barnier said: “Guarantees, assurances, can be given in a document,\u0026nbspperhaps next to the treaty, not in the political declaration.“We can imagine an interpretative document, where there are elements such as those already in the letter from Tusk and Juncker. That was a letter from two presidents of two institutions. If the document is agreed with the United Kingdom, it would be much stronger.”However, he insisted that any new concessions will\u0026nbspnot include either a time limit on the backstop or a unilateral exit mechanism for the UK – a key demand of many Tory\u0026nbspEurosceptics.\u0026nbspHe said:\u0026nbsp“There cannot be a temporality clause, as it is impossible for there to be a unilateral withdrawal from it. The backstop must be and remain credible.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Efforts are under way to redraft the motion to find a form of words that MPs from across the party can support.\u0026nbspBut writing for The Independent, two of the three\u0026nbspLabour MP representatives on the party’s National Executive Committee said it was “compatible with Labour Party policy”.Margaret Beckett, a former deputy Labour leader, and George Howarth said the plan “is the most credible way forward” and “offers a sensible compromise”.Mr Corbyn is facing a battle to convince many of his MPs to back Labour’s new policy, with dozens in Leave-supporting\u0026nbspareas\u0026nbspthreatening to rebel and vote against any second referendum.His efforts are likely to be boosted by the new poll, which found that Labour voters in northern and midlands seats want another referendum so they can vote against Ms May’s proposed Brexit deal.Fifty-four\u0026nbspper cent are opposed to the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement, compared to just 14 per cent who support it. Fifty-two\u0026nbspper cent say they want their MP to vote against the plan when it comes back before parliament.If a referendum were held on the deal, 16 per cent say they would vote to leave the EU on the terms of Ms\u0026nbspMay’s plan, while 69 per cent would want to remain in the EU.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSupport for a fresh public poll also reflects concerns about the impact of EU withdrawal, and particularly a no-deal Brexit, the survey found.Seventy-five per cent of Labour voters said they would feel either “concerned” or “scared” if Britain left the EU without a withdrawal agreement.Keir StarmerThey are almost as pessimistic about the consequences of EU exit even if a deal is agreed.Sixty-nine per cent thought\u0026nbspBrexit would damage the economy,\u0026nbsp59 per cent said the NHS would get worse and 52 per cent thought\u0026nbsptaxes will rise. Fifty-eight per cent said leaving the bloc would result in a worse standard of living for them and their family, while\u0026nbsp64 per cent thought it would make the next generation worse off than the current one.Mr Corbyn will\u0026nbsphope that his pivot to support a fresh referendum will increase his party’s performance in the polls. Worryingly for the Labour leader, the YouGov survey found that only 58 per cent of people\u0026nbspwho backed his party at the 2017 election say they would definitely do so next time around – equating to just 2,830 of the 5,000 voters polled.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But the case got a fresh look under Donald Trump.\u0026nbspSteve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said the Justice Department probably indicted Mr\u0026nbspAssange last year to stay within the 10-year statute of limitations on unlawful possession or publication of national defence information, and is now working to add charges.“There’s nothing else that would make sense,” he said.\u0026nbsp“The heart of the controversy is, there’s never been a successful prosecution” for publishing classified information, Mr Vladeck said. “There has always been the spectre of a First Amendment defence.”\u0026nbspPeter Zeidenberg, a national security defence attorney, said he cannot see grounds for Ms Manning to refuse the subpoena.Julian Assange rejects UK-Ecuador deal allowing him to leave embassyManafort ‘met with Assange in months before Wikileaks released emails’Julian Assange has been charged in US, prosecutors accidentally reveal“She’s already been prosecuted, she’s been convicted, she served a sentence,” he said. “She has no Fifth Amendment privilege over self-incrimination. If she doesn’t testify then she’ll be held in contempt.”\u0026nbspMs Manning appears to be the latest inidual subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury investigating Mr\u0026nbspAssange in the Eastern District of Virginia.Last July, computer expert David House, who befriended Ms Manning in 2010 at a hacker space in Boston he founded, testified for 90 minutes before the grand jury.In an interview, Mr House said he met the WikiLeaks founder in January 2011 while Mr Assange was under house arrest at Ellingham Hall, a manor house 120 miles northeast of London.Mr Assange was fighting an extradition request by Sweden, where he faced an inquiry into allegations of sexual assault.Mr Assange asked Mr House to help run political operations for WikiLeaks in the United States. “Specifically, he wanted me to help achieve favourable press for Chelsea Manning,” he said.Mr House, who testified in exchange for immunity, said the grand jury was interested in his relationship with Mr\u0026nbspAssange.“They wanted full insight into WikiLeaks, what its goals were and why I was associated with it,” he said.“They wanted explanations of why certain things occurred and how they occurred... It was all related to disclosures around the war logs.”The grand jury seemed interested in whether Mr\u0026nbspAssange had solicited Ms Manning to hack on WikiLeaks’ behalf, but did not press “very hard” on that, he said.During her trial, Ms Manning testified that she acted on her own to send documents to WikiLeaks and no one associated with WikiLeaks pressured her into giving more information.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Destroyed and deserted buildings are seen at the scene of ongoing fighting between Somali soldiers and al-Shabab fighters in Mogadishu, Somalia.

The Kumbh Mela is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at Sangam that dates back to at least medieval times. Pilgrims bathe in the river believing it cleanses them of their sins and ends their process of reincarnation.

Some of her Facebook Live videos have received\u0026nbspas many as 2,000 views. She said she wears pyjamas because she says good night to them at the end of the video, and she wants to be “true to what I\u0027m saying”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEach Tucked-in Tuesday begins with a roll call of sorts, as Dr George gives a shout-out to the students who have signed on and pop up on her screen. She has to be careful she pronounces every name correctly.“They\u0027ll come in the next day and tell me, \u0027You\u0027re saying my name wrong,\u0027” she said.This is the most important lesson you can teach your childHer readings promote family time, she says, because parents watch along with students (she calls them scholars rather than students). It\u0027s also interactive because Dr George asks questions for the children to answer as she reads.When she read the book “Ladybug Girl”, she slid on enormous ladybug wings and cuddled a large stuffed ladybug. The evening she read “Madeline\u0027s Christmas,” she had on a Cookie Monster onesie with the hood up.There was a huge inflatable astronaut behind her last Tuesday as she read “Astronaut Handbook”. Dr George announces the reading grade level of each book, and her students can take an optional quiz about the book the following day as part of the school\u0027s reading comprehension curriculum.The evening she read “Ladybug Girl”, she came to a page where Ladybug Girl\u0027s brother says she can\u0027t play with him because she\u0027s too small. Dr George paused and looked into the camera.“How many of you have ever been told that you\u0027re too little to do something?” she asked. “I have three older sisters, and they used to tell me I was too little to do something.“But guess what?” she asked with a glint in her eye. “I did it anyway.”\u0026nbspHer audience laughed along with her.Dr George said 94 per cent of her students come from economically disadvantaged homes, and last year\u0027s literacy tests showed that an average of just 55 per cent of her third, fourth\u0026nbspand fifth-graders were reading on or above grade level.Created with Sketch. Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902)Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter’s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original.330 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003)Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional  ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn’t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 430 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan)The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature.530 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.130 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902)Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter’s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original.330 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003)Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional  ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn’t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 430 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan)The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature.530 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8.

He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.She said since she became principal this school year, students have made strides in literacy. “We\u0027ve already seen growth,” she said.Dr George said she has a deep understanding of growing up in an economically disadvantaged home. She and her five siblings grew up in a three-bedroom trailer in Louisiana.Her father, who worked at a crawfish farm, dropped out of school in fifth grade to care for his father. Her mother stopped school in 11th grade.“My mom and dad were great parents,” she said, adding that they emphasised education even though they did not have a lot of it themselves. “My mom was a really smart lady.”\u0026nbspShe said she gives positive feedback to her students, and has high expectations, but also knows the importance of meeting them where they are. For example, she said she does not\u0026nbspwant students to feel like they have let her down if they don\u0027t end up attending college.“I understand some of these kids will never go to college, but I don\u0027t want them to feel like they\u0027re not successful. Whatever you choose, just be good at it,” she said. “If you\u0027re a ditch digger, be the best ditch digger there is.”\u0026nbspIn addition to reading to them once a week, she also has twice-weekly dance parties at school and does home visits to give students kudos and to help them if they are off track.“Anything I can do to build relationships,” she said. “If a child feels loved they will try. There\u0027s no science about it.”\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

That would be a democratic disaster.Yes, this Government has made a catalogue of errors from triggering Article  with no plan, to letting Brussels decide the sequencing of Brexit talks.But at this stage, with the clock ticking towards midnight, there is no time for “coulda woulda shoulda” about what went wrong when.Sun readers knew all along that in a negotiation there’s always give and take.You can’t get everything you want.And although the Prime Minister’s deal has flaws, it’s actually far better than many critics will admit.Those same critics can also be wildly unrealistic about the actual alternatives on offer now.The most likely alternative is in fact a far softer Brexit, which leaves Britain with less not more control.ImagineDavid Cameron had won from Brussels a deal that took back control of immigration, let us set our rules covering the key services sector, and allowed us to scrap the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy.Let’s suppose it gave us control of our fishing waters, let us choose environmental and employment laws as long as we kept to certain general standards, and which got us out of the EU’s political project. He would have been a hero.Yet that is precisely what Theresa May has secured. Even in a worse-case scenario —we end up in the backstop — we will have achieved all those things and will get a veto over new EU directives.We wouldn’t have to pay a single penny of membership costs.I’m not pretending the deal is flawless. We need to improve it to know we can’t be trapped in the backstop forever, and to ensure the EU can’t impose dferent rules in Northern Ireland from the rest of our country.But it sometimes seems that the Prime Minister’s critics cannot see the wood for the trees.Eurosceptics used to say what we wanted was to turn off the tap of endless new European laws, to stop the ratchet where the answer to every question seemed to be “more Brussels”, and to go back to a trading relationship. That’s ­literally what this deal does.So why did her deal suffer such a ­historic defeat last month Some MPs have deeply held concerns, particularly about the backstop, that the Government is rightly trying to address. Some are pursuing perfection. Others — especially in the Labour Party — are just playing politics.But there’s also a group for whom the real issue is personal as well as the policy.They just don’t have faith in the Prime Minister. This is no big secret.More than a third of Tory MPs —  of them — voted against her leadership back in December. To get through that, Theresa May had to promise she wouldn’t lead the party into the next election. But now she may have to go further.I’ve heard senior backbenchers on all sides of the Conservative Party say that their concern about voting for the deal, is that it could mean the Prime Minister stays in place to negotiate our future relationship with the EU.They want someone  to take forward the next phase.If Theresa May manages to agree a deal — and I think she ultimately can — she will have achieved Mission Impossible.But to scrape that deal through the Commons she might, as Sun columnist James Forsyth has suggested, have to throw the kitchen sink at it by agreeing to step aside.Downing Street aides privately acknowledge that she doesn’t want to “go on and on”. They know she faces another inevitable and painful leadership challenge by the end of the year — they want to see her leave with her dignity intact.It’s likely Brussels will eventually give some reassurance on the backstop.This might not quite be the full ­open-heart surgery changes to the deal some want.But the test should be whether the legal position changes. If it does, then the deal deserves to pass.And then, come the end of March, we can stop endlessly re-running referendum arguments about whether we should or shouldn’t leave the EU.We can get on with arguing about what sort of country we want to be after Brexit.We can discuss what we want to do with our newly won ­freedoms.And as a country we can start to move on together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a shareholder in hundreds of ­companies, from Greggs and ­Wetherspoons through to Superdry and Moneysupermarket.The UK is already the third-largest destination for this Norwegian investment, and now they’re putting in more.It seems almost surprising, given the endless choruses of woe about Brexit and the pathetic state of our political class in Westminster. Who would want to bet on a country where the job of economic cheerleader is held by Philip Hammond, and the ­alternative is an out-and-out Marxist like John McDonnell The answer is that the Norwegians can see what we sometimes miss about our own country: The UK is a fantastic place to do business.Our legal system is respected around the world for its fairness and is viewed as a “gold standard” under which to sign contracts and do deals.Our corporate taxes are competitive, and are set to fall further. Our location and time zone help to make us a good bridge into markets around the world.Our language is spoken by billions of people, and is the chosen tongue of global business.Our culture is one that still prizes innovation and hard work, despite the best efforts of some Chancellors over the years.And most of all, our people — our greatest asset — are skilled and creative, as employers, inventors and workers alike.It doesn’t come naturally for us to blow our own trumpets and talk ourselves up, so sometimes it feels a bit awkward to ­consider the many things we have going for us.And we all love a good moan, to the degree that it’s essentially a national sport. But we should be careful that we don’t go too far and start to talk ­ourselves down.There’s a dference between being modest and acting like Eeyore with a hangover. Brexit in particular seems to have driven some people a bit loopy, so that you hear some who were once quite ­sensible now ranting about “destroying the country” or “falling off a clf edge”.To hear them, you would think we are a repellent disaster zone, about to slip beneath the waves never to be seen again, like Atlantis crossed with Towie.This is obviously ridiculous. Of course it’s possible that the process of leaving the EU will be dficult.Thanks to politicians who are still ­incapable of honouring their promises and agreeing a clear way forward, the uncertainty about our future ­relationship with our European neighbours has been allowed to drag on for far too long.But it isn’t Brussels, or even Westminster, that made this country wealthy and successful. It is an enterprising approach to le, combining imagination and hard work, that got us this far.Businesspeople and workers, not ­politicians, created the UK’s success.That won’t go away just because we aren’t paying Jean-Claude Juncker’s lunch expenses any more.And once we escape Brussels’ control, we will be free to be even more ­innovative and nimble in response to all the challenges and opportunities the modern age throws at us.The people entrusted with Norway’s £billion national wealth fund can see that. And they aren’t alone.In the latest available data, the UK was Europe’s top destination for foreign investment.Unlike the blowhards and scaremongers chucking out doom and gloom for ­retweets and laughs, these are serious investors, putting their money where their mouth is and betting that our country has a bright future.I know who I’d believe.Norway fund has holdings in:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will claim their rebellion against Theresa May — a cynical, calculated risk that she is too weak to sack them — was designed to make Brexiteers realise ­voting down her deal could kill Brexit.It may have done that. But it wasn’t lost on Brussels either. And it has severely weakened our hopes of getting the one thing Brexiteers and the DUP need.Cabinet Remainers are guilty both of rank disloyalty and short-sighted stupidity.FOR a shining example of Remoaner madness, witness the negativity to Norway’s huge investment in post-Brexit Britain.Its £billion wealth fund is increasing its UK holdings because, like Qatar, it is sure we will thrive outside the EU.To ex-Labour MP Chris Leslie, though, Norway is just hoovering up our assets on the cheap due to Brexit. Yet he would have been first to blame Brexit had Norway SOLD its UK investments.Some politicians have simply abandoned reason. Their Remainia is religious.THE BBC should be allowed nowhere near its new “BritBox” service.The supposed BBC ITV rival to ­Netflix will require a reported £-a-month subscription. Yet BBC shows are funded by licence-payers. Why should we pay more to see them again ITV’s involvement is fair enough. They’re a private firm. But the BBC loves acting like one, while enjoying a £billion annual bung from TV owners extracted via threat of a criminal record.Why should it be able to deploy that monstrous public subsidy against a brilliant private innovator like Netflix If it wants to compete as a subscription service, fine. But first scrap the licence fee.WE cannot recall a more woeful set of MPs.Yet, without even a vote on it, they will trouser another inflation-beating . per cent pay rise to almost £, a year.That’s  per cent up since .

But what will happenit doesn’t pass is truly appalling.If Mrs May’s deal hasn’t won a Commons vote by March , the Commons will vote on whether to proceed with No Deal.The Parliamentary arithmetic is such that No Deal will be defeated.The next day, Parliament will then vote on whether to request an extension from the EU. This vote will almost certainly pass.At this point, the UK would be in the weakest position it has ever been in this negotiation.Whether to grant an extension or not would be up to the EU and would require all  member states to agree.Any extension would almost certainly come with conditions.The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has already said it would have to be “justied by new choices by the British”.It would also be up to the EU to decide how long an extension to offer.If Parliament accepted the terms of the extension, then there would almost certainly be another effort by MPs to take control of the Brexit process.A cross-party group of MPs is already preparing to do this.If they succeed, Brexit would become softer still.Parliament would try to commit the UK to staying in a permanent customs union with the EU.Some MPs would even like to keep the UK in the single market as well, following EU rules on everything from financial services regulation to free movement.Others would use an extension to push for a second referendum.The only way to sidestep this scenario is for Mrs May’s deal to pass by the th.But given that it lost last time round by  votes — a record defeat for a Government bill — this is a hard ask.Mrs May’s plan for getting it through has been to get something on the backstop to reassure MPs that it won’t be permanent.Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, has been tasked with doing this.The key to getting the deal through is persuading the Tories’ confidence and supply partners, the DUP, to accept the deal.If they do, the Tory rebellion will reduce substantially.After all,the DUP are satisfied that the deal won’t end up splitting Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK — the principal criticism of the backstop — then it is hard for any Tory to object to it on these grounds.Along with the Government chief whip, Cox met the DUP on Wednesday night.The verdict of one senior DUP source after that meeting is that the Government is “not there yet” on getting enough for them to come on board.Some leading DUP figures think the move by Cabinet ministers to try to take No Deal off the table has made it less likely that Cox can get enough to satisfy them.“It’s tricky. Barnier isn’t yielding, the Irish aren’t yielding,” complains one Cabinet minister.At the moment there is little optimism in No about being able to hold a meaningful vote next week.That means the Government will have only one chance to turn round a -vote defeat.But Brexiteer MPs should remember that things will only get worseMrs May’s deal hasn’t passed by the evening of March .THE prospects of Mrs May’s deal passing depends on what the DUP and the European Research Group, the main Brexiteer bloc in the Tory Party, make of any changes Geoffrey Cox can secure to the backstop.The ERG has now set up a  of legal eagles to examine what Cox comes back with.The signicance of this group is twofold.First, the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds – a Cambridge-educated lawyer – is a member of it. This, as one former Cabinet minister tells me, shows “the symbiosis between the DUP and the ERG”.It means the DUP and the ERG are likely to take the same view of whatever Cox delivers. The second is that it provides a structure for examining any changes that Cox secures.Some in the ERG leadership were concerned that the veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash – also a lawyer – was determined to rubbish whatever Cox gets.They feared that an instant verdict from him could commit the group to opposing the deal come what may.But no one should think that the other lawyers in the group will be looking to give Cox’s work an easy ride.One leading Tory Brexiteer tells me: “If they unpack the stuffing of Cox’s codpiece and find it is a vainglorious appendage, then they’ll say so.”I understand that Cox is concentrating more on a clearer exit mechanism for the backstop than a time limit.But whether this will be enough to satisfy these lawyers remains to be seen. TOM WATSON’S group of Social Democratic Labour MPs is expected to have its first meeting next week.The question of what Watson, the party’s deputy leader, is up to with this group is preoccupying Labour insiders.One option is that he could use the group to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to adopt positions this group want him to.Labour’s electoral prospects cannot survive many more defections.If Watson regularly made clear thatCorbyn didn’t do X, Y or Z then this group might walk, he could change Labour’s approach in a host of areas.Fear of more defection is what explains why Labour is now moving towards backing a second referendum, and why Corbyn loyalist Chris Williamson has been suspended for saying the party is too apologetic about anti-Semitism.But by setting up this group, Watson also makes it easier for it to one day declare its independence from Corbyn’s leadership and stand on its own two feet as a new political party.The group will, over the coming months, work up the policies that any new party would need.IN private, Tories are eagerly speculating about the leadership contest they expect later this year.Allies of Boris Johnson had been confident that he would, eventually, secure the support of Amber Rudd.They didn’t expect the pair to run on a joint ticket.But they were hopeful that she would back himshe was knocked out in the early rounds of the contest.Securing the support of a Remainer from the One Nation wing of the party would have been a big boost to Boris’s campaign.It would have shown that – contrary to what his critics say – he COULD bring the two wings of the party together.But some of those close to him now fear that the Brexit dferences between them are too big to make such a pact possible.They worry that Rudd might now look for someone  to throw her support behind.One Boris backer tells me: “Amber is playing a very clever game.”If he had done that, Cameron would – probably – have won the referendum and would be coming towards the end of his second term as PM.In both recent negotiations with the EU, the UK has reduced its bargaining power by never properly preparing to walk away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s coming soon . . . and it’s going to be ruddy marvellous.I don’t think I’m giving too much away when I say there will be some big personalities trying to work as a team. And that’s always seriously entertaining.But also, the thing about The Apprentice is that none of the celebs realise when they sign up that it is probably the single most full-on thing they will ever do in their le.How do I know this  I was a ­contestant in  Lord Sugar’s aide.And when Lord Sugar asked meI would be on the Comic Relief show, I honestly thought: “How hard can it be ” How wrong I was.The girls asked me to be their project leader and we all quickly found out that you don’t know how much you will do for charity until you are part of an event raising money for Comic Relief. There is almost no limit.Also, it’s hard to do justice to the exhaustion. We were on the go from am until midnight. I was surviving on about two hours’ sleep a night.Probably my most vivid memory of the  show is cleaning two tonne of squid — what we misguidedly decided to serve at the fun fair we were organising. I was the only one who knew how to clean squid.Plus, as project manager I decided to take most of the rubbish jobs myself. And cleaning squid is very messy, as each one squirts ink.Just when I was pretty much ­covered in the stuff, I got a call from Trinny Woodall, who’d gone home to put her kids to bed.She said there was a party at PR guru Matthew Freud’s house and I had to join her to canvas the room for donations. While she turned up looking — and smelling — ine I had to rush there straight from the kitchen, stinking of fish.But boy was it worth it — we raised £million. Oh, and let the records show that £, of that was raised by the girls — with the help of some very generous friends.As well as bringing money to a brilliant cause, it’s highly entertaining viewing. And this year is going to be top notch, with some amazing players.The girls’ team consists of Amanda Holden, Ayda Williams, Kelly Hoppen, Rachel Johnson and Tameka Empson. The boys’ team is Omid Djalili, Richard Arnold, Russell Kane, Rylan Clark-Neal and Sam Allardyce. Their task is a ­cabaret-themed event.Sam Allardyce, former England football boss, was also my football manager at West Ham for several years and he was very, shall we say, authoritarian. But during this process he had on a hairnet and was making canapes — and, ahem, wore a bright neon dress with panache.I can reveal Claude Littner had a much better time than me overseeing the girls’ team. They were unbelievably dynamic, organised and focused.Meanwhile, the boys were all ­wandering around saying, ‘Er, what do we do ’ Believe me, it took all my willpower to hold my tongue and not try to get them organised.While the girls struggled to hold their ticket price, the boys stood firm and Simon Cowell put huge pressure on Ayda and Amanda with a surprise demand for the girls.But at the end of the day, one major donation to either team means anyone can win, organised or not.There is a jaw-dropping moment when one of the boys “entertains” the audience with balloons strategically placed to hide his, ahem, “three-piece suite” as Lord Sugar puts it. And when the balloons pop . . . you won’t believe what you have just witnessed.After the task, back in the boardroom, Claude was full of enthusiasm about how fantastic the girls were and what a brilliant time he’d had.I said nothing. When Rylan askedI had anything to say, I said: “Plenty — and none of it good.”They would have done anything for the charity. And I mean anything. I could hardly watch at one point. It really is laugh-out-loud funny.Boy is this show going to be worth the ten-year wait.Celebrity Apprentice for Comic Relief is on BBC on March  and .ONLY Elle Macpherson could manage to look a million dollars while wearing cosy winter warmers.She arrived as a special guest at Vienna Opera Ball in Austria wearing a grey knitted polo neck and white, wide-leg trousers – yet somehow managing to look the very definition of effortless chic.I am particularly envious because although I know I can brush up well, when left to my own devices my look is either bag lady or corporate stf.NEW figures showing how dramatically domestic violence has risen in London are truly sickening. There was an appalling  per cent increase in offences between  and .The sheer quantity is horric – in  there were , domestic abuse crimes recorded by the Met Police, compared with , in .These figures are for London but – obviously – it’s happening all over the country.I can’t help thinking thatit was revealed that , MEN had been attacked, assaulted and hurt by the women in their lives, more would be done to stop it.But what I really want to know is: Why are so many men intent on hurting women The good news is that Sadiq Khan, London mayor, announced an extra £million of funding for support services for domestic violence victims, saying cuts had left them at “breaking point”.Also, Clare’s Law means people will be able to check whether their partners have been domestic abusers.The legislation was named after Clare Wood, who was murdered and set on fire by her partner, who she did not know had previously served a three-year prison sentence for harassing another woman.These changes are positive.But isn’t it terrible that either thing is needed in the first place  Any domestic abuse whatsoever is shocking, tragic – and unnecessary. And we need hardline action to make it illegal.That involves stronger sentencing and an absolute zero-tolerance approach, until anyone guilty of it becomes a social outcast.She wants the cash to fund specic projects chosen by us – with more oversight to make sure the money is not squandered.I’ve got an even better idea. How about we don’t spend ANY money on foreign aid – except emergency disaster relief – and use it instead to fund our own hospitals, schools, housing and mental heath care NINE men were jailed in Bradford this week for a total of  years for grooming and sexually abusing vulnerable teenagers.A harrowing impact statement from one victim was read in court saying she was “nothing but a toy to play with”, which is vile.I want to know when we’re going to stop reading about these gangs of men who prey on and abuse young girls, ruining their lives.What is needed is prevention. Action must be taken in the care system to protect vulnerable young people and in society so people can speak out when they suspect someone is being groomed.Sentences should be stfer to make people think twice – eventheir moral compass is skewed – for fear of the consequences.This story makes me despair, though. What has happened to our community values to stop us looking after those who need it most HERE is your one-minute Brexit update for the week.There will be three key votes in Parliament.The first is a vote on Theresa May’s deal – her agreed terms for leaving the EU. It’s a “yes or no” question.We can only assume the answer will be no . . . again.Then the second vote – to leave Europe with No Deal.This is another “yes or no”. That, too, will surely be a no.So, MPs don’t want to leave with Theresa May’s deal and they don’t want to leave with No Deal.Then there will be another vote on delaying Brexit while they work out the terms on which we DO leave.That one could run for years and years.Blimey!MY heart goes out to the mother whose daughter’s stillbirth left her terried she would lose her two healthy sons. It really is a tragedy.And it must be unbearable for her that the NHS Trust admitted negligence.If she had a child who needed expensive care as a result of NHS negligence, it would make sense to sue the trust. But asking for £million compensation when the sad truth is all the money in the world won’t bring back her baby is a blow to an NHS already on its knees.In fact, its financial woes may even have contributed to the lack of care that caused this tragedy in the first place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are determined to create fairer workplaces and we recently announced the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation.“Alongside this, companies and business leaders must set an example and ensure a culture of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace comes to an end.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is thought he fled in a private plane after taking flying lessons.But now The Sun on Sunday can reveal he was granted taxpayers’ money to help fund his defence in his absence, a whopping £,. going to pay his solicitors bill and a further £,. for counsel to represent him at his trial.The case has echoes of speedboat killer Jack Shepherd. As The Sun revealed in December he got £, in taxpayer-funded legal aid despite skipping his trial and going on the run in Georgia.At the conclusion to Sovu’s trial at Blackfriars Crown Court last year Judge Rajeev Shetty said Sovu was one of the most ‘wanted men in the world’, adding: ‘He has shown breathtaking arrogance and put two fingers up to law and order.’The fraudster arrived in UK in  after completing a degree in Computer Programming and Electronics. He started a job at a software firm but was made redundant.Sovu led a gang of Romanians who built the skimmers and  ATM fronts from a shed in a back garden in Harwich Road, Colchester, Essex.The crooks used toy remote control cars to fool airport security when transporting the skimmers. By placing them inside the cars, they appeared as innocent wiring for the toys.The gang were finally stopped in  after British Transport Police officers identied suspects interfering with rail ticket machines.At Sovu’s trial prosecutors said the case involved ‘millions of pounds of fraud’ because the device ‘gives them access to your money and the banks money’.IT expert Nick Webber, who worked on the police investigation into Sovu, said: “He created thousands of these devices.“Each could hold , card details and the average bank account holds £, so he must have cost banks hundreds of millions and very likely billions of pounds.“He’s effectively the biggest bank robber in the world. He didn’t care who he sold the devices to or what they did with the money.“His skimmers went to organised crime groups and also probably funded terrorism. Card skimmers have previously been used by jihadis, people traffickers and arms dealers who supplied Middle Eastern terrorists.”Last night critics slammed the payment to Sovu - who is thought to have continued running his business in an industrial area in Shenzhen, mainland China, while living in Hong Kong.MP David Davies said: “I think I speak for all my former colleagues in the British Transport Police in saying how important it is that this man is brought to justice as quickly as possible“I am outraged that this inidual has taken £, in legal aid and has not even turned up to his own case.“He will presumably have vast assets from his criminal activities. Therefore it is vital that he is caught and stripped of his assets and his freedom as quickly as possible.”A Legal Aid Agency spokesman said: “We cannot comment on inidual cases but anyone found to have deliberately concealed or moved assets to qualy for legal aid will be ordered to pay back the money granted.“Victims are our priority and we must ensure that court cases continue to be able to proceed so that justice can be done.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than % of people who voted Labour in  and expressed a preference backed the move, according to a YouGov poll for the People’s Vote campaign.Some %, said the policy change to push for a new Brexit vote made them feel more favourably towards Labour, while % said it made them feel less so. The survey of , voters across the North, Yorkshire and Humber and the Midlands found that % would support staying in the EU, with % against. If it was a choice between Remain and backing Prime Minister Theresa Mays Withdrawal Agreement, the split would be % to % in favour of staying in the EU, according to the survey. Only % of those polled wanted their MP to back the Governments proposed terms for leaving the EU.   And more than two thirds, %, said it was more important to maintain frictionless free trade than control immigration, while % disagreed with the statement. Peter Kellner, former president of YouGov, said: The myth that Labour voters in the partys heartlands favour Brexit is just that - a myth. Those who voted Labour in  in the Midlands and North favoured Remain by two-to-one in , support Remain by three-to-one today and,given a referendum choice between Remain and Theresa Mays Withdrawal Agreement, back Remain by four-to-one. That explains why such big majorities of these Labour voters want a new public vote and approve of Labours new policy. This survey also suggests that Labours heartland supporters are less hostile to immigration than is commonly thought.

The HOP is to reluctantly accept Theresa May ’s new deal with Brussels.The SKIP is the transition to get a free trade deal in place while we are effectively still in the EU. And the JUMP is to finally cut all EU ties by December  at the latest. Tory Brexiteer Nigel Evans said: “Hop, skip and jump is not the clean break we all campaigned for. But now is the time for compromise to break the logjam.” Fellow Brexiteer and ex-Minister John Whittingdale added: “I want to leave on March . We have to compromise.”  Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Tory European Research Group, says he’d back the PM with backstop assurances. If Mrs May’s deal goes through, it would end moves to extend Article  or have a second referendum. Brexiteers now accept any Brexit delay risks it not happening at all.

But there was a big catch. His future in-laws insisted that he dress as a woman for the wedding. And Roy would have to keep up the pretence for months afterwards. This was because the British Sikh fshyamily didn’t want anyone to know their son was gay. Roy was so lovestruck he accepted the conditions and moved into their house in London. But he ended up trying to kill himself after nine months of abuse including shybeing ordered to wear a wig and high heels. Roy, now , met his future shyhusband when he was  at a family wedding. He recalled: “He started singing love songs to me and told me I had a beautul smile. Later he made a move and we kissed.” The pair started dating in secret as Roy was afraid his own Sikh family would disown himthey found out.   He said: “Two years later he asked me to marry him. I thought this was my very own fairytale love story.” Days later Roy received a call from his future mother-in-law. “We met up on our own,” he explained. “It was the first time I’d met her. “She said I was very good-looking and her son had chosen well. “But she told me that she comes from a big Indian family and there’s a lot of honour involved. “She saidI wanted to marry him I would have to dress as a woman on the wedding day. I would also need to pretend to be a woman for a while to convince the community her son isn’t gay.” He added: “I was gobsmacked. I thought, ‘How did that even come into her head ’ She had even brought a basket of women’s clothes and gold bracelets with her.” After agonising over the weird shyarrangement, Roy agreed. “I knew it was going to be dficult us being together as LGBTQ isn’t talked about in the Asian community,” he said. “I hadn’t even told my own family. But I just wanted to be with him and I would have done anything.”  Roy, who comes from Manchester, told his parents he was moving to London for work. In reality, he was living with his partner in his in-laws’ house in the capital and, as the big day drew nearer, he became ever more nervous. “Me and his mum would go shopping for the shywedding and she would tell me I was going to be her best friend. “Yet she never asked what I wanted. She chose everything. I couldn’t even pick the date. She just asked for money so I sold my brand new car and gave her pound, to pay for it all.” During the wedding at the family’s house, Roy nearly fainted from fear of being found out. “She told everyone in the community I was a widow and an orphan so I had no guests. I was forced to dress as a bride because they couldn’t accept a gay wedding. “This was supposed to be the best day of my le – it was the worst day of my le. “There were  people staring at me and only nine people knew the truth. “They all kept saying, ‘She’s so shybeautul’, and, ‘Does she have any sisters for our sons ’ “I was thinking, ‘Come on, you’re shypulling my leg here’. “My heart was beating so fast. I thought they were going to find out I was a man. But no one asked any questions. Luckily I was able to wear a veil for the majority of the ceremony.”   The next day Roy was told he would be called Lucky in future – and was not allowed to be seen without high-heels, full make-up and jewellery. “My mum-in-law started calling me her daughter-in-law,” he said. “There was a time when I came down in slippers, not really dressed. She said I needed to maintain myself at all times and never come down again like that. “I was so confused as it was just me and her in the house. “I kept thinking, ‘Does she not realise I’m a man and this is fake ’” Roy said she treated him “worse than Cinderella”, making him work  hours a day doing demeaning domestic chores. He was criticised for over-salting food and claimed he was once locked in a cupboard as a punishment. She also restricted his toilet breaks so that he would often wet himself. “I needed to be up at am to cook the breakfast. I had to cook all three meals a day. But I wasn’t allowed to eat. “She would tell me I was too fat and I wouldn’t pass as a woman.”  He became malnourished on just a bowl of Weetabix and a smoothie a day. Roy sought comfort in his husband, who he still loved, but says they barely had any time together. He recalled: “He didn’t see what was going on and we argued about it shyconstantly.” Then Roy’s partner started shycalling him his we, buying him lingerie and shyexpensive jewellery. Roy’s own parents found out his secret and disowned him when snaps of the wedding appeared on Facebook , exposing Roy as the bride pictured. His mum-in-law forced him to visit them dressed as Lucky. He said: “She wanted to sit down with my family and tell them what had shyhappened. They took it really badly and told me never to come home again.” Roy finally found the courage to leave his husband and in-laws after nine months. He said: “Sometimes I would look at myself in the shymirror and think, ‘Who is this person looking back at me ’ “I wanted to rip the clothes and wig off. I was dying inside. Roy eventually left with nowhere to go and ended up in a homeless shelter. At first he was relieved to be wearing men’s clothes again. But he added: “I felt out of place when I stopped dressing as a woman. I didn’t know who I was any more.” Four months later he tried to kill shyhimself after he found out his husband was set to marry a woman.  He said: “We would still have shyconversations on the phone and I would cry for him. But he told me he had to marry someone  – and he did it while he was still married to me. “Mine was a big lavish love story and it had turned into a nightmare. “I put my wedding outfit back on and I went down to the river and slashed my wrists. I felt like they made me his we so I was going to kill the we. I wanted to die in that way so they would have seen me die as his we.” A passer-by dragged Roy from the water and he was taken to a hospital, who called his parents. “They took me back home,” he said. “No matter what, when a parent sees a child in that state it makes them see they have to stand by you.” Now Roy performs in drag as ‘Miss Lucky’ in a bid to reclaim his identity. He said: “I wanted to take ownership of what happened. This is my way of shydoing that.” But the scars remain. He said: “I still can’t sleep. Sometimes I wake up screaming in the night and see her face. I shout ‘I’m not a woman.’ I never want this to happen to anyone .” Roy’s ex, who has not been named, said: “Me and my mum would like to apologise to Roy Lucky Singh.” "},{"url":null,"title":"puppy who helped brave owner","story":"NewsPuppy who helped brave owner recover after brain surgery to compete at CruftsEXCLUSIVE: Ella Gibbs begged for a white puppy just moments after waking from her op, six years ago - and was given Lulu by her mumShareCommentsByJessica Cripps:,  MAR NewsElla Gibbs and Lulu will be taking part in their first ever Crufts competition this year \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs brave Ella Gibbs faced shyemergency brain surgery she begged her mum Louise for a puppy – a little white one. Of course Louise said yes to her shydaughter, who was ten. Doctors said her mum could promise the child anything to keep her calm shybecause she won’t remember it after the shygruelling -hour operation. But the first thing Ella said when she came round was: “Mum, Dad, where’s my white puppy.” So Louise, , honoured her promise. Since then Ella and her shih-poo Lulu have formed such a tight bond that they are competing at Crufts this week. Even before they met, the puppy was helping Ella in hospital after surgery on a brain tumour following a seizure. Choosing her future pet’s name and planning for its arrival helped Ella cope with her shyintense month-long recovery.   Nine days after ing home to Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire, eight-week-old Lulu arrived. And the pair became the best of pals. Six years on, Ella and Lulu compete in agility trials and have qualied for their first Crufts competition. Louise recalled: “The surgical team said, ‘Keep her calm, you can promise shyher anything. She won’t remember shybecause we’ve given her stuff to help her through surgery.’ “We thought we would hear no more of it.” But Louise said afterwards Ella was shystruggling to string words together but laid there and asked her parents: “Where’s my white puppy ” Friends thought they were mad to grant Ella’s request so quickly but Louise has no regrets.  Louise said: “The first time Ella saw Lulu it was definitely meant to be. “I thought I can’t believe we’re recovering from this and shyintroducing a puppy into the house. “But it was the best thing we did shybecause Lulu just shybecame the focus of everything. “She would never be naughty or lick wounds – all the things that a puppy would normally do, Lulu didn’t. The puppy was part of Ella from the word go and even went with her when she shyed to school.” The family first tried out an agility trial session for dogs at a fair. It went well so Louise booked them in for a lesson, then more lessons. In only a year, Ella and her pet became competition ready. Ella lost her peripheral vision after the seizure but Lulu was in absolute sync with the teenager. Lulu, it seems, shyinstinctively adapted to stay in Ella’s sight, something her mum cannot explain. Ella, , said: “Lulu is definitely my best friend. It’s our first ever Crufts.”   She has no expectations of shysuccess but counts it as a victory that they are even competing in the world’s shypremier dog show – at Birmingham’s NEC from Thursday to next Sunday. She said: “We’re so excited. I feel like I need to try and get Lulu to do well. She’s a pretty little white fluffy dog but has the attitude of a St Bernard. She rules the roost.” Ella said her lack of peripheral vision is challenging, similar to a horse shywearing shyblinkers. In sports such as hockey she tends to run into people. Ella admitted: “I’m quite shyclumsy so I will walk into stuff or knock stuff over and I’ve just learned how to cope with that. “But Lulu is really good. I think she knows I have no peripheral vision shybecause she will always be on my leftshe’s running or she’ll get out of my way. “Lulu will always be calm and in the right place doing the right thing. “With Lulu it’s just natural.

The East of England Ambulance Trust told “knackered” staff they couldn’t take extended leave over the winter because of added pressures on the NHS. But its deputy chief executive, Lindsey Stafford-Scott, is now on a dream tour of Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. Last night one health union official branded trust executives hypocrites, adding: “It appears to be one rule for the bosses and another for dedicated frontline staff.” Paramedics were told they could take off no more than two weeks at a time to help relieve winter pressures on the service.   As well as being second in command at the trust, Ms Stafford-Scott earns pound, a year as its director of people and culture and head of HR. She has posted pictures of her holiday, to celebrate her wedding anniversary, online. Alongside one taken in Cambodia, she tweeted: “Visited the beautul Angkor Wat temples today. Breathtaking.” One trust insider fumed: “To be flaunting her trip on social media, when staff are absolutely knackered, is not very sensible. “It’s very dficult to get any leave at the moment. It smacks of double standards. When the going gets dficult they just swan off on their hols.” Rachel Harrison, of the GMB union, said: “There are serious questions for the trust to answer here about this apparent inconsistency, which leaves bosses wide open to the charge of hypocrisy. How can executives enforce holiday rules on others unless they are prepared to follow them too ”   Ex-LibDem health minister Norman Lamb said: “It beggars belief that she could think it’s approriate to do this. It’s complete abdication of leadership.” The holiday row is the latest to hit the trust which provides ambulances to East Anglia, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. Just days ago an NHS survey found it had one of the worst records in the country for staff retention and morale. And last week it emerged a tribunal had ruled the trust unfairly sacked a mechanic suffering mental health problems. Last night a trust spokesman said: “During the winter months...we ask frontline staff to limit their leave requests wherever possible, to support the welfare of all patient-facing colleagues and maintain our level of response to patients.” "},{"url":null,"title":"clubber sues 1m after needed","story":"NewsClubber sues for £m after he needed skull rebuilt after -stone bouncer performed body slam wrestling moveRory Davis suffered a brain haemorrhage in the attack and needed his head and face rebuilt with titanium platesShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JUN NewsGeorge Fessey slammed Rory Daviss body to the floor so hard, he was left with a brain haemorrhage \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA clubber who needed his skull rebuilt after a -stone bouncer performed a body slam wrestling move on him is suing for pound million. George Fessey slammed -year-old Rory Daviss body to the pavement after wading in on a dispute between Mr Davis and another doorman at the club. Mr Davis suffered a brain haemorrhage in the attack and needed his head and face rebuilt with titanium plates. He now suffers from headaches, hearing and memory problems, has to take anti-epileptic medicine and has persisting signicant disability due to the punishment his brain took, his lawyers say.Fessey, of Talbot Street, Swadlincote, was jailed for two years over the attack in January , after pleading guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm, reports the Derby. Now Mr Davis is suing Fessey and three businesses he says should be found indirectly liable for his criminal violence that night, at After Dark, in Mansfield, Notts, in December , In a writ lodged at Londons High Court, Mr Daviss barrister, Robert Smith, says that the then -year-old had been seeking to gain access to the premises and was rowing with another bouncer when suddenly and without warning Fessey intervened in the dispute. He picked Mr Davis up from behind, wrapping his arms around his waist and lting him off the ground to the maximum height which he was able to do. Thereafter Fessey rotated him around such that his head was to the ground. He then deliberately and forcefully drove and slammed Mr Davis into the ground head first, causing him to be rendered unconscious, suffering catastrophic injury, the barrister states.  Mr Davis injuries caused his brain to swell dramatically and surgeons were obliged to partially deconstruct his skull in order to save his le. The now -year-old, of Rotherham, West Yorks, who worked for a minicab business before the attack, is now at a very signicant disadvantage on the labour market due to the after effects of the attack, Mr Smith says.

It convinced me he was genuine.”  She now believes the fraudster had downloaded a film of the married star and muted it. “I thought ‘why is he interested in a orced granny from Ipswich ’ “But I told him I was there for him and started to call him ‘baby’. “We swapped pictures. He called me ‘honey’ and said I was beautul. “I told him, ‘I have not even met you and I love you’.” The crook said he had orphanages in the US, Turkey and Africa. Sharon offered to donate and sent pound by Western Union to dferent accounts, one in Nigeria. Then he told her of a film he was financing, The Desperate Adventure. One day he told her a movie vehicle had crashed and he needed , — pound, — towards a replacement camera from Turkey.  Sharon, who lives with her -year-old dad, got a pound, car loan from the Halax. Then she borrowed pound, from her -year-old uncle, telling him it was a start-up loan for her to work in the film world, and she sent the money to the Turkish account on January , believing ‘Kenny’s’ promise to pay her back. The fraudster then said his Turkish supplier needed more for shipping. Sharon took pound, from her credit card and transferred it last Tuesday. She says: “My oldest daughter had said, ‘Don’t do it” and my youngest one said it was a scam – but I had already sent the money.” Next day came her “lightbulb moment” — an unsolicited Facebook message from yet another ‘Kenny Johnson’. Sharon says: “I realised I was being targeted in exactly the same way.” She got back in touch with her scammer. Still calling her “honey”, he promised to pay the loans back. Devastated Sharon has reported the crime to police, but doubts she’ll ever see the cash again. “I feel terrible as I’ve let down myself and my family,” she says. “Now I want to warn other women about the fraudsters out there.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle faces plot buckingham","story":"NewsMeghan Markle faces plot from Buckingham Palaces men in grey says royal writerRoyal biographer Anna Pasternak claims these men in grey are plotting the Duchess of Sussexs downfallShareCommentsByElaine McCahillAssistant News Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsMeghan Markles is being targeted by Buckingham Palaces men in grey says a royal biographer \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle is facing a plot from Buckingham Palaces so-called men in grey who are planning her downfall, claims a royal writer.Anna Pasternak, a royal biographer, claims members of the royal court want to remove the Duchess of Sussex as a threat to the throne.

Louella, , died after Broughton failed to get help for her when she had a bad reaction to a party drug he gave her at a festival — and callously recorded her drawn-out death on his mobile while laughing. Ex-girlfriend Paulina Aberg, , came forward as his trial started, claiming he did the same to her. Speaking from Stockholm, Sweden, Paulina’s mum Maria, , said: “As soon as she saw what happened to Louella she was determined to help.   “She wanted to show Louella’s family that she stands by them. It was a tough decision but she’s an amazing girl to have done it.” Broughton, , got eight-and-a-half years for manslaughter. He gave yoga teacher Louella Class A hallucinogen C-P at Bestival in Dorset in  — then filmed her while laughing and giving “shout-outs” to his rap group. On Thursday, he was found guilty of “shocking and despicable negligence” in failing to get help. It was then revealed he had a track record of giving women large drugs doses and filming the results — as well as a “morbid” interest in images of death. Paulina flew from Sweden to be interviewed after coming forward to court officials and prosecutor William Mousley QC. She told police that just a month before Louella’s death, Broughton had given her drugs and then filmed her suffering.   Paulina, who met Broughton while working at a London fashion store, claimed “it affected her badly and she fell”. She said her head smashed into a sink, knocking her out cold. Paulina claimed Broughton then took a picture of her unconscious, which he later sent to her, and left her to call an ambulance herself. The prosecution argued the evidence showed a pattern of the rapper intoxicating women and recording the consequences for his own warped pleasure. Maria said Paulina was so disturbed by the similarities with Louella she contacted authorities. She said: “She had to look through the diary she kept at the time they were going out to see what he did and it was sad. She gave it to the police.” Maria admitted she had sent her daughter away on a “long vacation”, adding: “She is very upset. She’s had to take time off from uni.” Paulina’s music producer dad Ingemar said of Broughton: “I hope he rots in hell.” At Winchester crown court Louella’s dad, Holby City actor John Michie, said in a statement: “I go to bed every night with the trauma of the image of Louella, crying out to her mum and dad, her brother and sister to help her, but there was only one person who could have helped.

Last year the -year-old was the first foreigner in the Carnival’s  year history to lead the procession as the ‘muse abre alas’ - lead dancer - for her samba school at the world-famous carnival.

We’ve seen heroin, cocaine, cannabis and ketamine shydestroying lives, leaving scars. But the latest addiction quietly taking hold is dferent. Because it’s one that doctors are shyfeeding. And while everyone has been busy panicking about GPs shyoverprescribing antibiotics, no one has noticed how painkillers — opioids — are being churned out. I have taken painkillers for things like period pain and, more recently, muscle pain for Dancing on Ice. I do believe that sometimes you have to work through the pain for the body to heal properly. But when it affects quality of le, then we do need to turn to GPs. And to trust they know what is best for us.   This week on Loose Women, Janet Street-Porter opened up about being prescribed painkillers after a knee operation. She was given  dihydrocodeine tablets and could take up to eight a day. Plus she had the antidepressant amitriptyline, which gave her “dreadful anxiety dreams”. She said: “All this medication was meant to make me feel better but actually I felt tearful and stoned.” It took her weeks to scale it down.   An older relative of mine has arthritis and is in constant pain. I’d never taken much notice of what she was being prescribed, but I had noticed her never-ending trips to her GP and chemist for tablets. I always thought the doctor knew best and never shyquestioned it or asked how she felt. I now fear she could be well on her way to being addicted to painkillers. The US has been battling an opioid epidemic since the s. Last year, the city of Los Angeles even filed a lawsuit against shypharmaceutical firms for deceptive marketing and sale, accusing them of exaggerating the benefits of opioids and downplaying risks. We need to wake up to the fact that the problem is getting a grip here and devastating lives. Anyone on your street could be an addict. You don’t need to hang around dodgy bars or surf the dark net to get a fix. You just pop your repeat prescription in. Opioids have two effects — they relieve pain and make you euphoric. So you feel like you’re safe and on a fluffy cloud.   The trend for prescribing them is on the rise, especially in deprived areas. The number of deaths linked to one called fentanyl shot up by almost a third in the UK in a year. Fentanyl can be up to  times stronger than heroin. With an ageing population, and aches and pains getting worse, we could end up with a generation of shygeriatric junkies. But anyone can get hooked. Celebs including Prince, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Michael Jackson, Heath Ledger and Brittany Murphy died after being addicted to painkillers. Le can be painful and tough — and who wouldn’t want to make it better by popping a pill  Our GPs are trained to make patients feel better as quickly as possible, so in the time and system they operate in, painkillers are the easiest answer. But some studies even show that for long-term back pain, these drugs are no better than a placebo. So as painful as it might be, we need to deal with this problem now. And tell GPs to rein it in.

A shocking new study reveals that Britain’s Top  worst spots for under- drinking include no less than FIVE areas around the show’s Newcastle base.

Experts are now warning that reality TV shows like Geordie Shore, with alcohol in almost every scene, lead shychildren into dangerous behaviour. Data for the past three years from Public Health England shows South Tyneside is the worst place in the country for under-s needing hospital treatment for drinking too much, with almost  per , population hospitalised over three years.

Areas of London fare best in the study – Brent, Waltham Forest and Havering all have admission levels of less than  per ,. Dr Jo Cranwell from the University of Bath has specically researched Geordie Shore, which launched the TV careers of Vicky Pattison, Marnie Simpson and Charlotte Crosby. She says that in scenes with “real people who young viewers in particular relate to” viewers are exposed to “extreme levels of alcohol content including high levels of intoxication”. She adds: “This all suggests Geordie Shore might be a risk factor and could be exacerbating serious problems shyassociated with binge drinking.” She found that nearly  per cent of scenes throughout season  of the MTV show featured alcohol. Her fear is shared by Colin Shevill of North East alcohol awareness charity Balance. He said “This north-south burden of harm long pre-dates Geordie Shore, but it does highlight the way alcohol is glamorised in TV shows and through advertising. There is overwhelming evidence that exposure to alcohol marketing increases the risk.”  He also believes the government must push up the current “pocket money prices” of booze, as has already happened in Scotland. “It is still possible to buy a bottle of strong white cider with the same amount of alcohol as  shots of vodka for just pound. in England,” he said.

Brent Howze, the wildle biologist seen in the snaps, said: Apparently a lot of people think it’s fake, but I can assure you that it is not. I’m the one in the picture, and you can probably tell that I didn’t get too close to it. He told the Cordele Dispatch : It took a while to get it out of that ditch.It was bigger than we originally anticipated, and we had to use heavy equipment to move it. The expert said the alligator was more than  feet long, had a chest girth of more than  inches and weighed an astonishing  stone.   But sadly, the experts found the alligator had been shot in the stomach. They had to put the creature down as a result. Mr Howze reassured citizens in Georgia Lake Blackshear remains safe. He said he and his family still intends to swim in the water in the summer, a popular pastime in the area.

The gadgets provide a -degree street view scene and advice on how to deal with aggressive pets on their rounds. Self-defence training shows a postie dropping to one knee to protect herself and using her postbag as a shield. The move comes after a string of shyhorric attacks in which rogue pets have bitten off fingers, thumbs and even a nose. The new “dog byte” computer program urges posties to look for signs that a pet is present and not to take at face value assurances that an animal is harmless. It also asks users what advice they would give to a new postman. If they make the wrong choice the rookie is bitten. Royal Mail has tried the system nearly  times since November. No attacks have occurred in more than half the areas where the units have been tested.   James Barton, Royal Mail’s online learning manager, said: “Over the years, we’ve tried to do lots of things about this. “We’ve done big public awareness campaigns. We’ve done lots of videos, brochures, booklets, slogans, cards, shyposters – anything you can possibly think of.

Speaking at a tech conference in London, he added: “When a dog is about to attack you, everything goes into slow motion, you have a slight ‘oh dear’ shymoment and then you get bitten, there isn’t the chance to do anything.” Last year, Belfast posties suffered the highest number of dog attacks in Britain – .

Myself and a mate were looking for somewhere to watch the tennis and, by chance, we met up with Pat and a few other United fans,” he said. “We had a good bit of banter and we’ve kept in touch since.”The friendship with Pat and other United fans actually led to the formation of a unique supporters’ club, the BeeArabs, so when Steve was planning his latest charity bike ride, this seemed an obvious route to take.“We thought it would be a good idea to start at Tannadice and head for Grfin Park. I had actually planned it as a practice run before I cycle from London to Paris and back via Guernsey in the summer, but this might be an even bigger task.“That said, my biggest challenge could be surviving the weekend with Pat before I set off on the bike!”Once he’s on his way, Steve will complete the journey in stages and take in Brentford games at Middlesbrough and Sheffield United before arriving at Grfin Park just in time for the clash with West Brom later this month.And thanks to the support he’s already receiving, he hopes to pass a personal milestone with his fund- raising efforts.“I got into cycling a few years back and I’ve done a charity ride to Amsterdam to raise money. It’s a great way to stay fit and, by the time I’ve completed this journey, I should have raised around £, in all for a few charities, so that’s not bad.“I am loving the support I am getting from all in Dundee.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"a look back at the centenary celebrated in 1959","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Centenary Week was held in  in celebration of  years since the founding of our town.With the joining of the roads to Oban, Inveraray and Campbeltown making for a convenient settlement, a petition was signed by  householders # , people # to make the village of Lochgilphead a burgh.The elected commissioners had their first meeting on May , .The th anniversary celebrations included a long list of events # a parade led by Provost A.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14072284.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_130718SAUL_06JPG.jpg","title":"familys new hope 85000 raised","story":"NewsFamilys new hope as £, is raised to send son to America for cerebral palsy treatmentThe six-year-old will be heading to America after the huge sum of money was raised to fund his treatment.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR NewsSaul with brothers Clay and Mylo and mum and dad, Karen and Stuart \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family’s bid to help their son walk again is set for take-off. Little Saul Wylie will travel to America for le-changing treatment on his severe form of cerebral palsy. The six-year-old, who weighed just lb at birth, has made the waiting list for pioneering surgery. There has been a massive charity effort across Ayrshire to fund the trip, with pound, raised in little over six months.Mum Karen, , told the Ayrshire Post : “To achieve this so quickly is beyond our wildest dreams.“We set a target of two years to get the money but the community reaction has been incredible.” Saul, of Tarbolton, has to go to the States because his aggressive condition is not treated on the NHS. The brave kid lives with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, which affects his muscle tone and leaves him unable to walk unaided. Karen said: “Saul’s dream is to be able to stand by himself and take independent steps and maybe even one day walk around school with his friends. “Like every parent, we long for endless opportunities for our boy. “Saul is very happy and determined but we just want him to have the best opportunity at a better quality of le and to become as independent as possible.”  Medication, Botox, and even trampoline therapy have all been used to try and limit Saul’s pain. But his spot at St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri could be the ultimate answer. Karen said: “The operation is called selective dorsal rhizotomy, which will reduce Saul’s muscle stfness. “Added to intensive rehab, it will allow Saul to stand independently and potentially walk again. Unfortunately there is a waiting list for international patients so Saul’s surgery is not scheduled until . “But because we are in a position to go we have been put on their cancellation list and are keeping our fingers crossed.” Karen and husband Stuart have thrown themselves into a string of fundraising events with the ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign gathering momentum. Karen said: “We’ve done everything from coffee mornings to quiz nights and we can’t thank people enough for their response. “There have been skyes, race nights, sponsored cycles and I also did the Great Scottish Run. “People have taken Saul to their hearts and we’ve even had donations from as far afield as America, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. “Hopefully he now has the chance he deserves.” • An open ice skate for Saul will take place at Ayr Ice Rink on Sunday, April , from -pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugsCerebral palsyCharityAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14078982.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/0_Hibernian-v-Celtic-William-Hill-Scottish-Cup-Quarter-Final-Easter-Road.jpg","title":"hmv re opens three scottish","story":"NewsHMV re-opens three Scottish stores after successful negotiations with landlordsThe companys managing director confirmed the move was \"the best outcome for our staff and customers\".ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsGeneral view of HMV at Ayr Central\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMusic giant HMV has re-opened its shop in Ayr Central shopping centre.

South Ayrshire Council’s attempts to open a pound million market have been hit by more inactivity. Bosses claim they are now targeting a May opening date – almost two years later than scheduled. Officials this week admitted they had suffered “signicant delays” in their bid to reopen the former Clydesdale Bank and Suburbia Bar. An initial revival date of September  was promised when council chiefs began their transformation of the site.

Sleazy retired architect Ross McKay will also be kept under court supervision for the same period. McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour but he was found guilty after a trial last month. Sherf John Montgomery told McKay: “You have been convicted of conduct which, in my estimation, contains a substantial sexual element and a signicant sexual aspect by clandestinely taking photos of female schoolgirls wearing short skirts. “At  years of age you really should be able to control yourself more appropriately than you have done by indulging in this sort of behaviour.” Sherf Montgomery warned McKay: “I detect an air of defiance from you, both at your trial and in what you have told the author of your criminal justice social work report. “My advice to you is keep a low profile. Do not put yourself in a position where it can be construed you have the aim of self-gratication.” Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane successfully argued against the imposition of a stringent sex offender prevention order against her client. This was requested by depute fiscal Vicky McMillan, and would have kept McKay out of public parks and well away from schools.   Ms McBlane said: “He is first offender and there is little to suggest he presents a signicant risk to the public.” Sherf Montgomery reminded her: “He continues to deny responsiblility.” But Ms McBlane maintained: “He very much recognises the authority of the court and he has assured me of his commitment to any order you might impose.” McKay, of Ardlochan Terrace in Maidens, insisted at his trial that he had not taken the photos of Belmont Academy schoolgirls in mini skirts that were found on his phone. He also denied stopping his car in Peggieshill Road to take the images, although the court heard evidence of a vehicle with the same registration as McKay’s parked there. The offences took place in mid- and again in March .

Bernard Cotton was at Alloway Bowling Club when he collapsed and died on Thursday last week. He had been club champion on ious occasions, the last time in . But it was as manager of the Gaiety from  to  that Bernard made his biggest impact. He took over at a critical time when the theatre’s ownership passed from the Popplewell family to the Royal Burgh of Ayr. But Bernard was the perfect man for the job, having managed the Empire Theatre in his home town of Sunderland. There he had hosted shows featuring The Beatles and Hollywood legend Marlene Dietrich. “He even shared a McEwan’s Export with Marlene,” said son Sam, . “They didn’t have any champagne to give Marlene so she had what dad was drinking - only with ice.”. Bernard was no ordinary theatre manager and often directed big showpiece events like pantos and summer season shows. He quickly became respected by some of the biggest names on the Scottish scene. He booked acts like Jimmy Logan, Billy Connolly, Rikki Fulton, Jack Milroy and perennial Gaiety favourite Johnnie Beattie. Bernard also knew some of the biggest UK stars, bringing Ken Dodd, Barbara Windsor, Pat Phoenix and Lionel Blair to the Gaiety.  He did not shy away from tough decisions, booking the controversial erotic revue ‘Oh! Calcutta!’ in . He later recalled: “It brought much adverse publicity and even the poster was frowned upon - to such an extent that the management agreed to cover over the female posterior that was displayed upon it.” However, the show was a massive financial success with only two unsold seats in a week-long run. Sam remembers his dad sharing a story of a couple walking out of the show in high dudgeon. Bernard asked them why, as it had been advertised as an X-rated show. The shocked couple told him they thought they had booked to see ‘Oklahoma!’. Another of Bernard’s controversial - but highly successful - bookings was ‘The Rocky Horror Show’, which attracts enthusiastic fans who often dress in stockings, corsets and suspenders. For although Bernard principally ran a family theatre, he believed it should cater for all tastes. A post on the Gaiety Facebook page says: “We are deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Bernard Cotton, a much loved colleague, dedicated family man and friend to all. “Bernard was and is a Gaiety institution, from his own time managing our Old Lady to helping us shape her future. We simply couldn’t have done it without his support. “His guidance, golden nuggets from years gone by, witty humour and love for delivering high-quality theatre for all were second to none. He will be sorely missed by us all. “At this sad time we are thinking of his beloved we Vida and children Julia and Sam. “We wish them moments of peace and comfort as they remember a husband, father and friend who was so cherished. “He will forever be in our hearts and minds and will always have a place in his beloved theatre.”  Musician Martin Henderson commented: “Bernard was witty, professional and a family man, a privilege to have worked for many years in the Gaiety while Bernard and Vida were at the helm. “He ran a tight ship but embraced risky ventures like our annual mock panto, which needs no explanation to Gaiety staff. A sad loss to Scottish theatre and his family.” Journalist Alistair Nicol said: “I met Bernard when I was deputy editor of the Ayrshire Post in  and he was always helpful and a great inspiration to all around him in the entertainment world.” Bernard Cotton was a former president of the Rotary Club of Ayr He is survived by we Vida, a stalwart Gaiety volunteer who formerly ran the theatre’s costume department London-based daughter Julia, , a former dancer and Brighton-based son Sam.

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

So far,  volumes of Hoggrsquos work have been collected, and  have been published.The project started in the mid s and the estimated finishing date wonrsquot be till .The programme of events is still

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"dalintobers dazzling daffodils","story":"Since October, come rain or shine, they have been making forays into Craigowan Woods for a morning lesson outdoors.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Jonathan Ross is a big fan. Rab Christie and Iain ldquoNoddy DavidsonPick a hit comedy series over the past two decades ndash Rab C Nesbitt, Still Game, Burnistoun, Scot Squad, Gary: Tank Commander, Chewinrsquo The Fat, Limmyrsquos Show ndash and chances are their names are on the credits. Christie is managing director of The Comedy Unit and Davidson a producer director. Danny BhoyAs you read this Daniel Danni Chaudhry is about to begin a huge tour of Australia and New Zealand where he is, by all accounts, ldquohuge. You can understand why. Originally from Moffat, he is a likeable, adroit purveyor of observational comedy. James FinlaysonEmigrated to America in  and made a living in theatre before moving to Hollywood where he became the fth Beatle to Laurel and Hardy. No-one has ever done a double take head move better than the boy from Larbert. Una McLeanScottish acting royalty McLean, from Strathaven in South Lanarkshire, can turn her hand to comedy sketch shows, panto, serious theatre and film. She is currently appearing in BBC Scotland drama series River City. Her career began at the Byre Theatre in St Andrews in  and in , she starred in Scotlands first one-woman television show, Did You See Una  Chic MurrayThe Godfather of surrealist comedy  Probably. Murray also had a free range style that allowed for music hall gags \"kippers ndash fish that like a lot of sleep\" and the rather more philosophical. \"Get into yourself to get yourself out of your self. Then try to lose yourself.\" They driest delivery this side of Gobi desert milk run also helped him sell surreal jokes such as \"I drew a gun. He drew a gun. I drew another gun. Soon we were surrounded by lovely drawings of guns.\" Most modern comedians worship at the altar of Murrays memory. Sanjeev KohliFor years Kohli, who as a youngster worked in his familyrsquos convenience stores, was the comic king of the cornershop, delivering us laugh after belly-laugh from behind a counter, as Navid Harrid, the grey-bearded shop-owner in Still Game, or as Ramesh Manju in award-winning, cult radio comedy Fags, Mags  Bags. Now a regular on River City, hersquos left the shop behind, playing banker-turned-baker AJ, and recently appeared in the biopic Stan And Ollie. Ivor CutlerIt was George Melly who maybe summed up the late Ivor Cutler best: ldquoVery funny in a sinister sort of way. The Scottish poet, songwriter and humourist grew up in a Jewish family in Govan, appeared in The Beatles film Magical Mystery Tour and was a favourite of John Peelrsquos. Proof that England doesnrsquot have a monopoly on eccentricity. Jerry SadowitzFew comedians dare take their stand-up to the places Sadowitz has been known to go, probably for good reason. The humour is as black as the trademark top hat, the material wince-inducingly controversial and the live shows chaotic and aggressive, meaning TV appearances have been rare . Despite this, the Glaswegian remains one of the most influential ndash and isive ndash stand-ups of the last  years. Bruce MortonBruce Morton did the best comedy show ever. March  at the MacBob in Stirling when he was touring Blood Below the Window, his autobiographical one-man show, which was hilar , but had a sucker punch of hurt at the heart of it. Apart from his dalliance with Channel  , Morton has always been too marginal a figure for his talent. But no one is better at hearing the comic music of the Scots tongue. Dorothy PaulThe undisputed Queen of Scottish comedy, the Dennistoun woman is as funny as she is loved by Glaswegians who love to be taken down memory lane to a world of jeely pieces and fumbles and the dancin. Paul convinced as an excellent actress in the likes of The Steamie, and more recently Still Game, but it was her live touring shows that revealed her glorious skills of holding an audience in the palm of her hand. Robert Florence and Iain ConnellThe duo behind sketch show Burnistoun brought us characters such as Jolly Boy John, Biscuity Boyle and Quality Polis, as well as co-writing the sitcom Legit which starred Clare Grogan, Jordan Young and Raymond Mearns. Florence will front topical satire series, The State of It, on the new BBC Scotland channel.Iain Connell: Work In Progress, Blackfriars Basement, March  and  Robert Florence is Biscuity Boyle: My Bastart Le - One Last Time!, Oran Mor, March  and  Ronni AnconaOne of the best impressionists of her generation, Ancona, who grew up in Troon, is also an accomplished stand-up and an impressive actor. But itrsquos her uncanny ability to capture everyone from Nigella Lawson to Audrey Hepburn, Victoria Beckham to Ruby Wax, Renee Zellweger to Jenner Saunders that continues to amuse. Scotland The WhatThe talented triumvirate of Buff Hardie, Stephen Robertson and George Donald ruled the North-eastin the s, s and early s with the now-neglected art of comedy revue. Dont miss the phone call to the Queen, inviting her to open Oldmeldrums sports day . Fern BradyFern Brady reached the finals of So You Think Youre Funny at the  Edinburgh Fringe and hasnt looked back since. The performer from Bathgate is bold, honest and at times startling ndash listen to her trashing of heterosexual marriages, or her take on Australias abortion laws ndash but never less than very funny. Whats not to like about a former journalist and stripper whos dryer than the inside of a sand lizardrsquos top lip and more blunt than the new Mary Poppins. Janet BrownThe Rutherglen-born actor and impressionist will always be best-known for her memorable impersonation of Margaret Thatcher at the height of her pomp, which cropped up throughout the s and s everywhere from Mike Yarwoodrsquos popular Saturday night show to Bond film For Your Eyes Only. Gerard KellyKelly, from Glasgow, was a panto favourite in the city and a talented serious actor, but his big break was as hapless bank worker and would-be author Willie Melvin in the BBC Scotland comedy City Lights. He was the lynchpin of a stellar cast . He died in  following a brain aneurysm. Jane McCarryShe steals the show as loveable busybody Isa Drennan on Still Game. As the hit BBC Scotland comedy bows out later this month, who wouldnrsquot love to see Isa and shopkeeper Navidget their own spin-off series  The campaign starts here. Robbie ColtraneColtranemade his name in the alternative comedy movement of the s before becoming a household name. He was brilliant as a criminal psychologist in Cracker he appeared in two Bond movies he was an outsize presence as Hagrid in the Harry Potter films. In the  C series National Treasure he was outstanding as Paul Finchley, an ageing comedian suddenly beset with allegations of historical rape and sexual assault. Richard WilsonIf you ever see Richard Wilson in the street, do not shout his catchphrase at him. In fact, donrsquot even think about the catchphrase. Yoursquore thinking about it now arenrsquot you  The thing is, Wilson was, and is, much more than catchphrase comedy. He once said that there was some of his dad in Victor Meldrew, star of One Foot in the Grave, and some of the writer David Renwick too, but the point is that, as he shakes his fist at idiocy, there is some of all of us in him. Arabella WeirShe coined the catchphrase \"Does my bum look big in this \" for The Fast Show, lit up our screens as long-suffering neighbour Beth in Two Doors Down and most recently had a star turn on comedy drama Pure as a mother whose OCD-suffering daughter is plagued by sexually explicit thoughts. Janey Godley and Ashley StorrieFrom Godleyrsquos ldquoTrump is a c*** sign held aloft as the US president visited his Ayrshire golf resort in  to Storriersquos hilarious parodies of Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and The Handmaidrsquos Tale becoming viral hits, this mother and daughter are fearlessly chipping away at comedyrsquos glass ceiling.

McHugh also starred in Channel rsquos Fresh Meat, written by Peep Show creators Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain. He has since moved on to straighter roles ndash hersquos currently in Channel  spy drama Traitors and Skyrsquos A Discovery Of Witches ndash but donrsquot think wersquove seen the last of Corporal McLintoch. Alan Cumming and Forbes MassonDrama school pals Cumming, from Aberfeldy, and Masson, from Falkirk, performed as musical double act and Kelvinside men Victor and Barry throughout the s and s, before finding success separately on stage and screen here and in the US. They briefly reunited in similar guise for the sarcastic, surreal cabin crew comedy The High Le alongside Siobhan Redmond. Stanley BaxterStanley Baxter once cleared the streets with his television specials that attracted m but the Glaswegian suffered all his le from anxiety and a need to be in control. As a result, Stanley, who lives in North London, offered up product sparingly, the world having the opportunity to see his Dietrich or his Coward only episodically. What he has created however is an incredible Bafta-winning legacy. LimmyIf you like your comedy surreal with a good dash of daft, Glaswegian Brian Limond has been the go-to purveyor for more than a decade. Arguably the first true UK comedian of the internet age, Limmy grew a loyal local online audience with his strangely loveable band of characters ndash who could forget former heroin addict Jacqueline McCafferty or frustrated adventure gameshow host Falconhoof  ndash but has found national recognition thanks to TV, live shows and two books.Limmy, Surprisingly Down to Earth, and Very Funny, Oran Mor, March , ,  and  Alastair SimYou have to be very serious to be good at comedy and Alastair Sim was very serious, particularly about his stage career. But itrsquos the films we love. Like A Christmas Carol. Is Simrsquos the greatest Scrooge  Probably. Or Laughter in Paradise in which hersquos a good man forced to go bad to inherit some moneyAnd The Belles of St Trinians of course in which he plays the headmistress Millicent Fritton. British comedy finds pretty much nothing funnier than a man in a dress but Alastair Sim did it best. Gregor Sharp and Simon CarlyleThe creators and writing partnership behind Two Doors Down which is hands-down one the funniest comedies to grace our TV screens in recent years with echoes of sitcom greats ndash from Abigails Party to The Royle Family ndash in its winning formula. More please. Gregor FisherThe ragtag Govan philosopher Rab C. Nesbitt was, as Fisher once noted, \"somebody who was forgotten, somebody from the so-called underbelly of society.\" Indeed he was, but Nesbitt managed to be one of the funniest comedy characters to emerge from Scotland, and one of the most poignant, too. He made us laugh but the laughs were sometimes uncomfortable ndash there were lots of acute social truths in them. Daniel SlossNetflix-approved and still not , Sloss has the armour-plated arrogance of youth. Sometimes that can come across as simply arrogance. But, as his latest show X, which tackles toxic masculinity, proves, he is ambitious for his comedy. He also has the stagecraft. In other words, hersquos good now, but how good is he going to be  years from now  Michelle GomezFrom unhinged staff liaison officer Sue White in Green Wing to murderous Missy in Doctor Who, Gomez brilliantly nails weirdly offbeat, deeply funny characters. The Glaswegian, also known for comic turns in The Book Group and Bad Education is currently appearing in the Netflix supernatural horror series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. The KrankiesThe Krankies in the top  best Scottish comedians of all time  Are we mad-dabi-dozi  Not really: remember that Janette and Ian Tough were masters of three neglected areas of comedy: the club circuit, which is where they first made their mark in the s comedy for children on Crackerjack and the likeand pantomime, which the Krankies have dominated in Scotland for years. And no, wersquore not defending the single they released. It was not fan-dabi-dozi. No-one danced all night. And it was not all right. Rory BremnerHeonce fooled Margaret Beckett, then a minister in a Labour cabinet minister, into thinking she was talking on the phone to the Chancellor Gordon Brown. She wasnt, of course: it was the mischievous Bremner, who had Browns distinctive burr down to a T. The spoof was a reminder of his formidable impersonation skills and his gt for political satire. The hit Channel  show, Bremner, Bird and Fortune, is much missed. Rikki FultonNotmany comedians can make us laugh merely by saying lsquohellorsquo. Watch, on YouTube, any of Rikki Fultonrsquos turns as Rev I.M. Jolly on the Hogmanay Scotch and Wry shows, and you see just that: the lights going up, and Rikki, with an almost audible sigh, uttering that ineffably melancholy lsquohellorsquo. Fulton had been one-half of Francie and Josie, had starred in iety and panto, and was a serious actor, too. The Rev I.M. Jolly became a Hogmanay must-see for many Scots. Ashley JensenJensenwas fetchingly eccentric as Ricky Gervaiss best friend, Maggie, in the Gervais Stephen Merchant-penned TV hit, Extras. She has gone on to refine her comedic and acting gts in TV and in film, including Ugly Betty and Agatha Raisin. The good news is that she can be seen alongside Gervais again in After Le, Rickys latest dark comedy, in which he plays a man struggling after the death of his we. It starts on Netflix on March . Ford Kiernan and Greg HemphillThe co-creators, writers and stars of Still Game and Chewinrsquo The Fat have more than earned their place among the upper echelons of Scottish comedyrsquos hall of fame, gting the nation an enduring lexicon that includes ldquoTwo pints, p**** ldquoThatrsquos plenty! ldquoYoursquove taken that too far and ldquoTake a drink!. Ronnie CorbettBoth venerated and under-ratedEdinburgh-born Corbett came for the fore during the satire boom of the s. But it was in the s and s that his star truly ascended, courtesy of his double act with Ronnie Barker and the programme they fronted, The Two Ronnies. Notionally he was the straight guy, but only notionally as subsequent generations of comics knew full well: David Walliams, Matt Lucas, Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais were among those who sought him out in his later years. Frankie BoyleDark and pessimistic humour. Close to the bone jokes. Brutal analogies. Boyle stokes controversy with his no-holds-barred subject matter. A rare family-newspaper-friendly sample: ldquoLas Vegas and Glasgow have a lot in common: theyrsquore the only two places in the world where you can pay for sex with chips. Kevin BridgesImpish, irreverent, clever, the natural successor to Connolly on the comedy stage ndashhe has the desire to keep going. Bridges manages to take seemingly ordinary le experience and turn it into something far less than ordinary. And he clearly has a head for political satire. \"Working in Poundstretcher for no wageshellipworking in a shop where everything is worth a quid except you. Elaine C SmithA bona fide national treasure, Elaine C Smithrsquos career to date has encompassed not just comedy but also singing, straight acting , journalism, political campaigning, even teaching, all delivered with the aplomb and brio of a natural raconteur who excels at everything she turns her hand to.Typically, however, she has a more self-effacing take on the motives behind her genre-defying years in the spotlight. The idea, she once said, is to ldquojust keep moving ndash yoursquoll be less of a target. Seriously, though, nobody is likely to be taking aim at the star, who turned  last year: the charisma oozing from her when shersquos in character is unforced, and off-stage shersquos as warm, personable, generous and defiantly un-starry as you would expecther to be.Smithrsquos list of achievements and associations runs the gamut from Ato, wellnot Z than at least as far as W, standing for Wildcat Theatre. Smith first encountered its politically-inspired progenitor, :, at the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow as an -year-old and, suitably inspired, performed regularly with Wildcat throughout the s, including in the original production of The Steamie. Among her other credits in serious acting roles are BBC One drama Two Thousand Acres Of Sky and Kay Mellorrsquos hit series The Syndicate.But itrsquos for her contribution to comedy that shersquos best known and in particular for the role filed under M: Mary Nesbitt, aka Mary Doll, aka the long-suffering spouse to Govan nersquoer-do-well Rab C Nesbitt, he of string vest and filthy gutties fame.Smith clocked up her first of many Rab C episodes when the show debuted with a one-off pilot episode in late , and she was still there in  for the New Yearrsquos Day Special which found Rab fighting the bedroom tax. As an integral part of the much loved and award-winning show, shersquos now firmly embedded in Scotlandrsquos cultural DNA.Nobody will ever hail Mary as a role model for Scottish women or a worthwhile advert for hands-off parenting, but as an iconic comic character therersquos no touching her, and itrsquos hard to see who  in the Scottish acting firmament could have done her justice.Away from the dysal world of the Nesbitt family Smithrsquos comic skills have been put to good use in pantomimeand in less nihilistic TV sitcoms such as City Lights, in which she starred alongside the great Gerard Kelly, and in current hit Two Doors Down .Importantly, Smith also developed her own one-woman show, first mounting it in the mid-s and blazing an inspiring trail for a generation of younger Scottish actresses and comics to follow. And follow they have, another reason Elaine C Smith sits so high on our Scotlandrsquos Funniest People list.An Audience with Elaine C Smith, Kings Theatre, March  Armando IannucciIn an era when fake news is both a reality and a slur to be flung at reputable media organisations by emotionally incontinent politicians, it often feels ascurrent affairs and the reporting off them have moved way beyond satire. Which may explain why Glasgow-born writer, producer, director and arch-satirist Armando Iannucci is heading into space for his next project ndash Avenue , a sci-fi comedy for HBO starring Hugh Laurie.Butthe next chapter in the Scotrsquos comic journey takes place off-planet he leaves behind a treasure trove of earth-bound gems and itrsquos on account of that three decade back catalogue that he ranks so highly in our Scotlandrsquos Funniest People list.Cerebral and opinionated, with a liking for the scabrous and possessed of the outsiderrsquos eye which is vital for satire, Iannucci cut his teeth at BBC Radio Scotland in the late s on the likes of Norsquo The Archie McPherson Show. But those same gnashers first left their mark on the wider cultural landscape when he co-created Steve Cooganrsquos Alan Partridge character for BBC Radio rsquos On The Hour in . In  Iannucci and On The Hour co-star Chris Morris took the show to television as news parody The Day Today but Coogan and Iannucci would continue the Partridge association across three more series following the inimitable Alan, surely one of British comedyrsquos greatest creations, from the highs of television stardom to the lows of a static caravan and a berth on Radio Norfolk.In , Channel  gave Iannucci his own self-titled show. Inexplicably, it ran for only one season but had it not then we may have missed out on the show that came next ndash The Thick Of It, a fly-on-the-wall style mockumentary which debuted in  and burrowed its way into the heart of the New Labour machine where it dispensed satirical headbutts to one and all. Many, though not all, of these were delivered by another inspired Iannucci creation, spin doctor and full-time sociopath Malcolm Tucker. He was played in the show by Peter Capaldi, another Glaswegian of Italian descent whose family were actually near-neighbours of the Iannuccis in Springburn.Of course with so much of the UKrsquos political and media landscape being influenced and affected by the United States, the endlessly ambitious Iannucci was never going to limit himself to these shores. In , he adapted The Thick Of It for cinema and dropped hapless British government minister Tom Hollander into Washingtonrsquos then un-drained political swamp where he was pitted against boorish American general James Gandolfini. The film was called In The Loop and it won Iannucci an Oscar nomination.Three years later he created Veep for HBO. Starring former Seinfeld stalwart Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the US Vice President it took the TTOI format and tweaked it to create a hilarious political comedy which did for le in the West Wing what TTOI had done for the fictitious Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship . Veep is now in its seventh and final season and the previous six were all nominated for Emmy Awards. To date it was won , including Outstanding Comedy Series for the last three years running.So, itrsquos space next for Armando Iannucci, a place where no-one can hear you scream . Butthe Scot remains true to form, donrsquot think you wonrsquot be doing exactly that. Billy ConnollyWHAT makes Billy Connolly not only the greatest comedian in the UK, but the world  Wersquove long attached superlatives to his name, long tried to wonder what makes the Glaswegian so funny. There are those who cite Sir Billyrsquos surrealist streak and highlight how the former shipyard worker was influenced by the great Chic Murray.But what is it about Connolly thatrsquos allowed him to become a global superstar, a comedian, actor, documentary film maker and half decent banjo player  What defines him INSECURITY: All the great comedians are blessed with tragic insecurity and Connolly is no exception. It instils constant searching, an analysis of the world around which they keep trying to make sense of, in the hope that along the way it can provide comedy gold. ldquoI think my securities far outweigh my insecurities, he said. ldquoI am not nearly as afraid of myself and my imagination as I used to be.But that wasnrsquot always the case at all. Recalling the seven year-old schoolboy who fell in a puddle and was laughed at, Connolly realised that being mocked was far better than being beaten by nuns, or the Aunt who looked after him, or his father who sexually abused him. He knew then that escape from perpetual misery involved making people laugh and actually enjoyed his puddle moment. But he also knewhe were to become a comedian he would have to cultivate a personality, to ldquomake myself look windswept and interesting.It took time however. The quest involved the teenager experimenting with several worlds, from libraries to the Scouts, to cycling clubs to a religious group with whom he would travel to houses and read the Rosary to those ldquowaiting to watch the Beverly Hillbillies.CAMPERY: Even during his years in the shipyards, Connolly was never reluctant to draw attention to himself, with outrageous footwear and outfits so far away from the regulation Burton The Tailor two-piece. Later on, this inveterate show-offrsquos stage outfits were never quite a threat to Elton,but he came close. No opportunity was ever missed to surprise, whether appearing in lurex, banana boots or deck chair jackets. The result provided a delicious incongruity the insecure clown on stage telling jokes about his grim childhood, yet doing so with a continuous flick of highlighted hair, or a swish of the silky poncho.HAIR: Connolly certainly put his hair to good use. He has always had a very good head of it, which allowed him to leave the shipyard aged . Anyone with less hair would never have dared to enter the milieu that was the Scottish folk scene in the Sixties. The folk scene was really a front however for his true intent to follow Jimmy Logan and Stanley Baxter onto the entertainment circuit, and make the world laugh. But the hair suggested dferent characters he could be the urban philosopher, he could be a hippie, before later taking on a grander power and nailing his audience with the Crucixion.AWARENESS OF REALITY: Connolly was shaped, moulded, battered and plated by the experience of working as a boilerman in the shipyards, from the ages of -. Yet, while that provided reams of raw material for a comedy act, Connolly hadnrsquot yet worked up the courage to make the leap. Indeed, it took a colleague in the yards who told him to leave and never come back, to see him go off and pursue the dream.Connolly, however, was clever enough to know he wasnrsquot ready to go it alone and for a while held the hands of Humblebumsrsquo musicians Tam Harvey and Gerry Rafferty. And he was aware, that when matched with Rafferty, he was out of his depth. ldquoIrsquove got a voice like a goose farting in a tunnel, he admitted. ldquoAnd Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge.BOLDNESS: Comedy, not folk music, was the future and success grew in Scotland with the release of his live albums. In , a taxi driver told Michael Parkinson how good the Big Yin was and he landed an invite. But how many comedians when offered the chance to appear on the biggest chat show in the land would tell a joke about we-murdering, sexual depravity and cheeky bicycle-parking  Connollyrsquos manager Frank Lynch figured this career was over before it really began. Wrong, Frank. So wrong.REFUSAL TO BE CONSTRAINED: If Billy Connolly once had to battle with an inferiority complex, being told he was useless by the aunt he lived with, he did a very good job of hiding it as his career rolled on. If anyone every bothered to tell him he could never become a playwright, he certainly didnrsquot listen.If anyone mentioned he couldnrsquot become a pop star, that too fell on deaf ears and he appeared on Top of The Pops several times with pastiches of Tammy Wynettersquos DIVORCE and the Village Peoplersquos In The Navy. .What was also apparent was Connolly wasnrsquot afraid to cause political upset, to create ide, at one time describing the newly devolved Scottish government as ldquoa pretendy wee parliament. The man who at one time owned homes in Aberdeenshire, New York and Malta, believed himself to be a citizen of the world. And somehow he got away with his critiques because, well, he was above it all.SOCIAL CHAMELEONISM: Connolly has been able to adapt to and fit in to a iety of worlds. His film career brought him into the orbit of the showbiz greats, the likes of Robin Williams and the Pythons, but far from feeling out of his depth, the Scot not only thrived but fed on his new source material. He discovered being Glaswegian could be a bonus. He made Glaswegians, for the first time, believe something very positive could come out of a housing scheme.WRITING: But itrsquos his comic writing that confirms the manrsquos genius. Aged , he moved to the Glasgow housing scheme, Drumchapel. He said later, ldquoDrumchapel is a housing estate just outside Glasgow. Well, itrsquos in Glasgow, but just outside civilisation. His similes are close to perfect. After appearing on the same bill as Elton John in the States in , the Scot was hit on the head with a pipe. ldquoThey made me feel as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit, he said later.HErsquoS A VARIETY ARTIST: While Connolly could come up with Chic Murray like aphorisms ndash ldquoMarriage is a great invention ndash but then so is the bicycle repair kit, or brilliant parodies such as the Crucixion, he has never been afraid to bend towards the Bernard Manning ldquoIf women are so bloody perfect at multi-tasking, how come they canrsquot have a headache and sex at the same time. Or how about: ldquoA biker goes to the doctor with hearing problems. lsquoCan you describe the symptoms to me rsquo lsquoYes. Homer is a fat yellow lazy b****** and Marge is a skinny bird with big blue hair!AND A PSYCHOLOGIST: Connolly offers big performance. No Rich Hall -side-of-mouth-jokes. He doesnrsquot just tell you a funny story. He throws it right onto your face. But he also understands and highlights the fragilities and complexities of the human condition, revealed with his line, \"Never trust a man, who when left alone with a tea cosey doesnt try it on.\" Even his throwaway comments ldquoBigotry is a hobby in Glasgow canrsquot fail to resonate.SELF-DEPRECATION: He can be in your face and seemingly confident but knows his limits and when to rein it in. Connolly, for example, points out he is usually killed off in the first  minutes of his movies. But he can act as he revealed in Queen Victoria biopic Mrs Brown, a perfect vehicle for his ability to switch from aggression to tenderness in the flick of an eyelid. But itrsquos also hard to see past his deliciously quixotic role in  dark comedy What We Did On Our Holiday.HErsquoS A SALESMAN: Connolly has sold Glasgow to the world. Okay, it wasnrsquot a shortbread tin version of his hometown, more a rusty Spam tin, with bits of stale meat still inside, but he never, ever failed to make it funny. Where Joycersquos Ulysses transformed the image of Dublin from a backwater to a metropolis, Connolly too has sold his hometown, its colour and vibrancy, its humour as dark as a boilermakerrsquos overalls.HErsquoS A FIGHTER: Billy Connolly offers up the black comedy line, ldquoIrsquove got Parkinsonrsquos Disease. And I wish tae f*** hersquod take it back. But at the same time Sir Billy is entirely aware of the impact hersquos had on so many people. And so he should be. \"Im very lucky in as much as I made a bit of a mark, and you think, well, I must have done something right.The Glasgow International Comedy Festival runs from March -.

It isnrsquot. Itrsquos pitched at an internal audience.In particular, itrsquos pitched at those many SNP members who are suspicious of the leadershiprsquos Growth Commission, the hair-shirt economic blueprint for an independent Scotland written by former MSP turned corporate lobbyist Andrew Wilson.A heresy against the  White Paper, the Commissionrsquos report recommended spending Decade One after a Yes vote driving down debt and keeping a tight grip on public spending. It also backed keeping the pound ndash at least for now.Ms Sturgeon declared herself delighted, the membership less so. Besides the whf of austerity, there was that plan to keep sterling and UK monetary policies. Former SNP MPs such as George Kerevan politely but firmly laid into it.After hosting a series of National Assemblies to hear the views of SNP members, Mr Brown will put a motion to Aprilrsquos conference backing most of the Commissionrsquos  recommendations, but with a more gung-ho line on currency.Writing for the home crowd in The National yesterday, Mr Brown said: ldquoWe will propose that it should now be party policy that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would establish an independent currency. So far, so clear. But then the fog descends.ldquoOf course, until that can be done safely and securely, our currency would continue to be the pound sterling. It must be done at the right time, in a way that affords necessary protection for our nationrsquos economy and for peoplersquos personal finances.ldquoThe aim of an SNP government would be to complete preparations in time for the newly independent Scottish Parliament, informed by assessments and information from the Central Bank, to take a decision on establishing a new currency by the end of its first term.ldquoThis will ensure that the use of sterling is not an open-ended commitment ndash an issue raised at the National Assemblies.The language is new. But at best, the leadership has moved from agnosticism on a new currency to a highly caveated inclination. Yet something that heavily caveated isnrsquot really a belief in anything. Itrsquos a fudge. Itrsquos also a muddle.For example, Mr Brown seems to suggest evidence and economics would count, but also that Holyrood would decide to back a currency on a set timetable regardless.A politically brave idea, as it would make the following election a referendum on whether to follow through with that decision.Mr Brown also reminds me of someone daydreaming about how theyrsquoll spend their lottery millions before theyrsquove even bought a ticket. It may be enjoyable, but therersquos the small matter of winning first. It was noticeable he didnrsquot offer a timetable on actually securing independence.The audience for this mush is clear from the last line, where he says activists at the partyrsquos National Assemblies didnrsquot like the idea of an open-ended commitment to sterling.They must be a conspiratorial lot. The Growth Commission never made an open-ended commitment to sterling. It said it should be used until something  made more sense, as did the SNP Governmentrsquos Fiscal Commission before the  referendum. Both said sterling was best initially because the UK and Scottish economies were so aligned.But both were open to a new currencythe economies erged. The Commission proposed six tests on credibility, markets, debt, trade, reserves , and public appetite. Explaining the process to voters before a referendum was an ldquoabsolutely necessity, it said. Both were also clear context was all. There was no dogmatism about having or not having a new Scottish currency. It all came down to the circumstances. They definitely did not say, lsquoLetrsquos do this in the first term of an independent parliament to keep the troops happy.rsquoBut it seems National Assembly-goers live in dread of an indefinite backstop on the currency, and want to put a time limit on it, whether itrsquos rational or not. How very ERG-like.I suspect that, behind the fudge, the SNP hierarchy is keeping faith with the Growth Commission, because it sees sense in it, while talking more warmly about a new currency to molly the members.This could backfire on several fronts. The members could see straight through it and get more disgruntled. It was interesting how much scepticism there was from senior SNP figures who want a new currency yesterday. The leadership is not trusted on this. Even vague talk of a new currency could become a giant bullseye for Unionists, who would use to it attack the SNP as reckless and flaky. The party has, after all, backed the euro, the pound, and now, sort of, a third currency.It does not seem driven by long-term national interest, but by short-term party management. The Tories have their Eurosceptics to placate, the SNP their sterling-sceptics.The key thing is whether it helps the cause. But who does this idea appeal to outside the  per cent Will a mystery currency move a single No voter to Yes  Did people reject independence because the last currency offer wasnrsquot radical enough  Did they object to their wages and pensions staying in sterling  Were they crying out to take a punt on a Scottish pound Mr Brown seems to think so. ldquoI believe this approach will maximize support for an independent Scotland, he wrote yesterday.

He wants to pitch himself as a potential First Minister and present his party as a united family to voters.Gary Smith, who leads a trade union that employed Leonard for more than  years, appears not to have been sent the harmony memo.CATCH UP: Smith blasts the state of Scottish LabourAccording to Smith, Scottish Labour has failed on Brexit and been weak on anti-Semitism. Damningly, he says Leonardrsquos strategy of ldquoriding on the coat-tails of Jeremy Corbyn wonrsquot work. In boxing terms, Smith has delivered a first-round knock-out.His analysis also happens to be shared by a growing body of opinion within Scottish Labour. I accept Leonard and Corbyn are close politically, but ideological similarities do not require a leader to surrender his autonomy and behave like a parrot.Brexit is his biggest failure. Leonard, much to the frustration of his MSPs and party members, has echoed Corbynrsquos Euroscepticism and opted to say as little as he can get away with on a second referendum. Both men want to strangle this option.Leonardrsquos hostility to a public vote is against the backdrop of over % of voters in Scotland supporting Remain in . Opinion polls show that backing for staying in the European Union has grown since the referendum. And yet, despite these facts, Leonard has bizarrely manoeuvred himself into the position of being the most pro-Brexit leader at Holyrood.His sleepy approach to the anti-Semitism row provides further evidence that his gut instinct is to defer to Corbyn. When the UK Labour leader resisted the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism last year, Leonardrsquos response should have been swt and decisive.ldquoThe party should sign up to the IHRA and all the associated examples, without hesitation. We must make amends with the Jewish community, the statement should have read.Leonard instead gave a feeble interview to the BBC during which he offered warm words to Jews, but nothing . Corbyn eventually performed a U-turn and, asby magic, so did Leonard. It is clear some of his supporters believe the anti-Semitism scandal has been exaggerated to damage the Corbyn project.As a result of his back-seat leadership, Leonardrsquos fortunes are now tied to the electoral performance of Corbyn. He has failed to exercise the autonomy many of his predecessors worked so hard to extract from the UK party. His team is effectively a satellite of the Leader of the Oppositionrsquos Office at Westminster.He may also regret trying to use Corbyn as his meal ticket to Bute House, as there is little evidence of a ldquoJC bounce in Scotland. As Smith pointed out, although Scottish Labour made gains at the last general election, the party only put on , votes compared with the previous poll. Around , of these were in Edinburgh South, where Ian Murray was explicitly anti-Corbyn.Two rows are brewing that will inevitably fuel Labour faction-fighting. On Holyrood selections, Leonard allies want him to use his majority on the partyrsquos Executive to hand-pick List candidates for next Scottish Parliament election. Such a move would be brutal, and could inject fresh blood into a jaded group of MSPs, but it would backfireit was used to install middle aged under-achievers from the trade union movement.The partyrsquos ldquoorganisational review, led by deputy leader Lesley Laird, is the other potential flashpoint. Scottish Labour Kremlinologists see it as an attempt to restrict the power of general secretary Brian Roy and his team. Insiders say UK Labour is already micro-managing Scottish Labour finances in an unprecedented way.Leonard is a nice man. He has a big heart and was a more authentic representative of Labour values than Anas Sarwar, who he defeated for the leadership. But he is flailing and his party is heading towards another thumping defeat.

For me, it started with my grandmother teaching me to read at the local library the summer before I went to primary school. She chose books by Geisel - beloved around the world under his pen name, Dr Seuss. Green Eggs and Ham, and The Cat in the Hat set me up for a lelong love affair with the written word.I taught my own children to read with Dr Seuss, and to this day my two daughters and I still read The Grinch together every Christmas Eve. Theyrsquore  and . They tell me theyrsquoll read the same books to their children, and I imagine in years to come those children reading Seuss to their own sons and daughters long after Irsquom gone.After I published my first novel, I began writing stories for my children, but I soon realised Irsquod never have the magic of Seuss - whorsquos been called the Milton, the Renoir, of childrenrsquos writing. So I began studying the le of Ted Geisel - I wanted to know what shaped this genius.Itrsquos a good time to tell his story: yesterday was Dr Seuss Day, when hersquos celebrated around the world, and Thursday is World Book Day - an excuse for children to dress up as their favourite literary characters. Unsurprisingly, the Cat in the Hat is one of the most ubiquitous outfits.Ted was a complex man, his soul could be as light as a childrsquos, yet his le - which charted the th century and took in many of its great themes such as war, wealth, race and changing social values - was often full of the pain of adulthood.He was born into a wealthy immigrant German family in the town of Springfield, Massachusetts, in , and named Theodore Seuss Geisel. Itrsquos thought Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, set his anarchic cartoon in a fictional Springfield in homage to Seuss. From the very beginning, Tedrsquos le was a mix of word-play and imagination. The brewery his father owned - Kalmbach and Geisel - was known locally as lsquoCome Back and Guzzlersquo, and his mother, from a family of bakers, sang weird nonsense songs to him about pies.His father helped run the local zoo, and encouraged Ted to draw the animals he saw there. Tedrsquos pictures were strange caricatures - with too many knuckles, or spindly legs. His first character came from one of these lsquozoo drawingsrsquo - a beast with ears nine foot long which he called a lsquowynnmphrsquo.His niece Peggy Owens - who was as close to Seuss as a daughter - said: lsquoHe never lost the ability to see things through the eyes of a child.rsquo That ability to retreat into a world of imagination became more important to Ted as he got older. When the First World War broke out, Ted found himself bullied by other children because of his German roots and with the coming of prohibition in peace time, the family brewery was closed.Ted was no great scholar but he excelled at English, and after school he went on to Dartmouth College. While there, he spent most of his time writing for the collegersquos magazine Jack-O-Lantern - which carried cartoons and comic stories. Classes forgotten, hersquod be found in the morning, sleeping at his editorial desk. His niece Peggy said: lsquoHe simply never stopped playing hookey from the real world.rsquoA run-in with the law over a gin party during prohibition saw him banned from the magazine. But Ted got round the punishment by writing under a nom de plume: Seuss. Phyllis Cerf Wagner - the actress, socialite and writer who married Tedrsquos publisher Bennet Cerf, and was instrumental in the shaping of the Seuss legend - said: lsquoHe took his motherrsquos maiden name, Seuss, as he was saving Geisel for when he wrote the great American novel.rsquoFor now, though, the dizzying heights of literature were to evade him. He went to Oxford University in the hope of becoming an English professor, but dropped out. He spent most of his time at Oxford doodling in his notebook - which brought him to the attention of a bright young American woman called Helen Palmer. Looking over his shoulder in a lecture, she saw one of his pictures - a flying cow - and told him he should become an illustrator. Not long after, they ed to America and married. Helen was less a muse and more a mentor - she encouraged and helped shape his work, and she brought order to his le.Ted was no party animal - he was shy, nervous in public, and liked the company of close friends not big groups, though he did love a vodka on the rocks and plenty of cigarettes - however, the strictures of adulthood were not for him. Without Helen, it was said, he wouldnrsquot have been able to balance a chequebook.Ted became a jobbing cartoonist and by now had added lsquoDrrsquo to his pen-name - an in-joke about the doctorate hersquod failed to get at Oxford. His big break came by chance. In the s, Flit was a popular brand of fly-spray. Ted drew a one-off cartoon for Judge magazine showing a medieval knight who canrsquot sleep because therersquos a dragon in his bedroom. The punch line reads: lsquoDarn it all, another dragon. And just after I sprayed the whole castle with Flit.rsquoHe was hired on the spot to do all Flitrsquos ads. lsquoThis became one of the most successful advertising campaigns in history,rsquo one of his biographers, Janet Pascal, says. Financially comfortable, Ted now turned his attention towards his lelong ambition: writing and illustrating childrenrsquos books.Ted was infamous in his family for exaggeration - he was always embellishing the truth . His first big success was more than a little autobiographical. The book lsquoAnd to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Streetrsquotells the story of a child out for a walk who imagines a fantastical adventure. A suburban afternoon becomes filled with make-believe giraffes, magicians, police - and a man with a ten foot beard.Initially, publishers turned the book down - it didnrsquot have a moral, they said - but finally it was bought and in  became a critical hit. Beatrix Potter was a fan, saying she adored lsquothe truthful simplicity of the untruthfulnessrsquo.Publicly, Tedrsquos le was on the up, but privately there was much sadness. His mother died before seeing his success, and his beloved sister Marnie drted into alcoholism and died whilst estranged from Ted. He and his we also learned they couldnrsquot have children. Ted would later invent an imaginary child lsquoChrysanthemum-Pearlrsquo and heartbreakingly dedicate a book to her. His friend and biographer Judith Morgan said: lsquoPart of his protection was to not allow himself to spend his le in grief, and perhaps thatrsquos why he found such joy in doing the outrageous books he did.rsquoHis next successful book, Horton Hatches The Egg, added the morality that Mulberry Street was seen to lack. It tells the story of an elephant, Horton, who finds an egg, abandoned by its mother, and sits on it in the hope of hatching it, in the face of threats and even the risk of being shot. lsquoShootyou must,rsquo says Horton, lsquoI wonrsquot run away. I meant what I said and I said what I meant, an elephant is faithful,  per cent.rsquoIt was a smash hit. Tedrsquos editor, Michael Frith, said: lsquoIn the hands of a gted preacher therersquos nothing more powerful than a great lesson.rsquoHorton appeared in . As war loomed, it would be seven years before Ted wrote another book. lsquoWhile Paris was being occupied by the clanking tanks of the Nazis,rsquo Ted said, lsquoI could no longer keep my mind on drawing pictures of Horton the elephant.rsquoToo old to fight, Ted enlisted and became a captain in one of the most remarkable propaganda outfits ever - the US armyrsquos First Motion Picture Unit. He worked with Mel Blanc , Chuck Jones , and Frank Caprachurning out films like Private Snafu - army slang for lsquoSituation Normal: All F****d Uprsquo - to boost the war effort.After the war, there was a social panic over the effect of TV on childrenrsquos literacy. Ted was challenged by his publisher to write a story for children learning to read using just  simple words. The limitations were tortuous but after a yearrsquos labour The Cat in the Hat was born - the story of a trickster cat who causes havoc in the lives of two young children.The book has been poured over by literary scholars. Itrsquos been subjected to Freudian analysisand to racial interpretations . To most, it simply captures the anarchy of childhood. Janet Schulman, an editor who worked closely with Ted, said: lsquoHe allowed a childrsquos imagination to guide him.rsquoTed was now re-writing the rules of how children learned to read. With Green Eggs and Ham, he reduced the number of words in the book to just  - making it a perfect primer - and was hailed as the saviour of childrenrsquos literacy, replacing stale Peter and Jane with the crazy Fox in Socks.Now the most important childrenrsquos author in the world, Tedrsquos stories became more political. The Sneetches savages American racism The Butter Battle Book mocks the Cold War The Lorax is an environmentalist fable. His politics often upset conservative America.In , after struggling with ill health, and depression over Tedrsquos affair with Audrey Stone Dimond, a friend of the family, Helen took her own le. Ted married Audrey less than a year later.Tedrsquos last book is one of his most loved - Oh, the Places Yoursquoll Go. Itrsquos Tedrsquos joyous take on le - his valediction to readers young and old. His agent, Jed Mattes, said it was lsquolike a wise grandfather sitting down and talking to a younger generationrsquo.In his last days, Ted, too unwell to make it to his bedroom, slept in his studio. He died in , just a few feet from his drawing board. After his death, the students of his old college, Dartmouth, recited his works for a full day, as a mark of respect to a man who had single-handedly shaped their childhood, and the collective childhood of us all."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  28 days to go and Westminster won   t even reject no deal  let alone back a People   s Vote","story":"I could give you a pious expression of naive hope.

Every country can benefit from graduates who have developed these attributes.Saudi Arabia, an oil rich dictatorship, was widely condemned last year over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The columnist was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was murdered and dismembered by a hit squad.One of the suspects is Dr Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy, a forensic pathologist who specialises in autopsies, and who allegedly used his skills to dismember Khashoggi.A number of media outlets, including the Herald, reported that he used to study at Glasgow University, prompting rector Aamer Anwar to urge the institution to ldquobreak all links with the Kingdom.Other than the Khashoggi scandal, a recent report by Amnesty International stated that Saudi Arabia ldquoseverely restricts freedom of expression, association and assembly. Its bombing of Yemen has also been condemned.The Herald on Sunday asked universities how much they had received in tuition fees - both undergraduate and postgraduate - from students from Saudi Arabia and other despotic regimes.Twelve institutions have taken in over poundm since  from Saudi students, with Glasgow University leading the way on pound.m.Glasgowrsquos website states: ldquoThe university has a long-established relationship with Saudi Arabia and we have been welcoming students here for many decades.In second place is Strathclyde University, which received over poundm from students from the same country.Strathclyde Universityrsquos website states: ldquoStrathclyde has a long history of welcoming students from Saudi Arabia.Edinburghs total stands at around pound.m. The same university accepted around poundm from a foundation created by Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, to establish an Islamic study centre.However, Scottish universities have received a far larger sum, nearly poundm, from Chinese students. Edinburgh benefited to the tune of poundm over three years, while Glasgow took in pound.m.According to the latest Amnesty report, China continues to draft new laws that present ldquoserious threats to human rights.The same report stated that the regime has strict controls on internet use, represses religious activities and attacks freedom of expression in Hong Kong.Ten universities received over poundm in fees from Russia-based students, with Edinburgh again topping the fee list.Vladimir Putinrsquos autocratic leadership has been marked by crackdowns on opposition politicians, as well as assassinations in the UK. Putin critics have long argued that regime-friendly oligarchs have spent their wealth in countries such as the UK.There is no suggestion that students should be blamed for the actions of their rules, but campaigners believe the amount of money involved raises wider questions.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: \"International students shouldnt be punished for the atrocities and abuses of their governments, nor should they be treated as a revenue stream for underfunded universities.ldquoHowever,the universities themselves are entering into official government partnerships or offering support to the regimes then questions need to be asked.ldquoThe Chinese, Russian and Saudi dictatorships all have utterly appalling human rights records, and Scottish universities should ensure they arent doing anything that could indicate support for them or legitimise them.\"MSP Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens education spokesperson said: ldquoThere is a massive dference between placing sanctions on those directly associated with a criminal regime and preventing all students from say Saudi Arabia from studying here.ldquoWhat we cannot allow is dependence on income from these students turning into institutional tolerance for oppressive regimes.

We didnrsquot succeed - thank god for that.At that time, the council had won an employment tribunal case saying that a job evaluation process it had completed a decade previously was sound. An appeals tribunal, however, had ruled that its practice of protecting bonuses that had previously been earned by male staff only was discriminatory.While the women were appealing the first decision and the council the second, Mr Cross said he would have been willing to draw a line under all proceedings to settle the payment protection part only.ldquoStatistically, therersquos only a % chance of overturning a tribunal decision so we knew there was a massive risk that we would lose the appeal - it was much more likely that we would lose than we would win, he said.ldquoWe thought we wouldnrsquot win until we got to the Supreme Court, although we didnrsquot even knowwe would get the possibility to get to the Supreme Court.ldquoWe didnrsquot know we would win at the Court of Session - that was the risk we were running - but it happened to be that we got a bench that clicked.After losing both appeals the council, which passed from Labour to minority SNP control in May , agreed to settle the claims, with the poundm deal being agreed this January after a year of negotiations. To help foot the bill the local authority, which will increase council tax by % this year, is mortgaging a portfolio of properties including the Riverside Museum and SEC Armadillo, with the annual cost of servicing that debt expected to run into tens of millions of pounds.Mr McAveety and Glasgow City Council both confirmed that the informal and unminuted meeting with Action  Equality took place, although they denied that the poundm figure had been discussed.ldquoThis did not happen, a council spokesman said. ldquoRepresentatives of ActionEquality restated their position that the council should stop defending equal-pay claims.ldquoHowever, officers are clear that no offer was made and that figure was not put to the council.Mr McAveety said that while he personally would have been in favour of negotiating an end to the dispute, his hands were tied by council officials who wanted to follow legal process.ldquoSenior officials said lsquothis is in the courts and therersquos been an employment tribunal ruling that has favoured the councilrsquo, he said.ldquoThe general discussion [at the meeting] was around the issue of the number of folk that Action  Equality were representing, an observation on the role of the trade unions and, from Stefan Crossrsquos point of view, that we should try to settle.ldquoIt was left to Robert Anderson and the chief executive [Annemarie OrsquoDonnell] to deal with and I never came back [to Action  Equality] because I thought there was no authorisation from the council.The eventual bill for the local authority is signicantly higher than Mr Crossrsquos original estimate because, in addition to the number of claimants more than doubling since June , it is compensating affected workers for having their jobs undervalued as well as for not being able to share in bonuses.The poundm figure covers the period from , when the discredited pay system was put in place, to either  or , with a further settlement expected to be negotiated to cover the period from that end point to when a new system is put in place.The new scheme is not expected to be implemented until  at the earliest, with , inidual jobs having to be assessed, compared and signed off by both the council and the womenrsquos union representatives first.The staff who are part of the claim are expected to start receiving their cash in the summer, with average payments in the region of pound,."},{"url":null,"title":"from-the-royal-mint-to-pure-minted-the-alphabet-of-scotland","story":"From the Angel of the North to Zebra crossings, the coins will be an A-Z of quintessential Britishness.The Loch Ness Monster will takes its place at ldquoL, which sparked a small debate in The Herald on Sunday offices over whether it should have appeared at ldquoN, for Nessie.So, in celebration of Nessie, Ron McKay has come up with his own list of quintessentially Scottish suggestions:A is for Arbroath, and the declaration of: Itrsquos what the home teamrsquos keeper exclaimed last month when his goal kick into a gale at Gayfield, on the lip of the North Sea, ended up as a corner for the other team with the ball eventually landing in Carnoustie.B is for Baw or Barsquo: Used as a prefix to a transportation receptacle, slang for male genitalia, and as a suffix for fit, and a game involving a leathern sphere wersquore notably bad at.

Ham is currently hogging American headlines due to an ongoing dispute with atheist pressure group the Freedom From Religion Foundation ndash who believe Ham is a bit of a swine. The FFRF promotes the separation of church and government ndash a rather bold endeavour in a state where Governor Matt Bevin recently declared ldquoThe Year of the Bible. Perhaps, understandably, FFRF mostly carry out their protests by way of the internet ndash you canrsquot shoot the head off an online petition, after all.The group is furious that pound million in state tax incentives have helped fund Hamrsquos creationist theme park, yet ndash to be fair ndash some state officials did try to stop these generous tax breaks after learning the hardcore creationist entrepreneur would only hire Christians. Fuelled by the stimulant of self-righteous indignation, however, Ham decided to sue the state in federal court ndash and brought home the bacon by winning his case. Impressed Kentucky politicians then saw fit to reward his indefatigable faith with another wee rebate check for . million. Praise the Lord, indeed.With the penny finally dropping that there may perhaps be some sympathetic fundamentalist mindsets on governmental boards, FFRF has now recalibrated its aim and taken direct action ndash sending letters to more than , public schools around Kentucky to highlight the mind-warping dangers of taking advantage of Hamrsquos offer of free class field trips to Ark Encounter.Certainly, the statue of a smiling diplodocus at the entrance is indicative of a wilfully ignorant and wildly subjective interpretation of the Earthrsquos four-and-a-half billion year history. Yet, where traditional theme parks such as Blackpool Pleasure Beach ultimately confirm there is no God, Ark Encounter solely exists to solidy belief in a ine creator and His miraculous six-day endeavour.A gay old timeARK Encounterrsquos piegravece de reacutesistance is, like it says on the tin, an ldquoaccurate -feet-long recreation of Noahrsquos Ark ndash complete with animatronic models of dinosaurs and humans living together in harmony, just like in The Flintstones. And Job :ndash,creationist Biblical interpretations of the word ldquobehemoth are to be believed.Yet, in a move not quite in the spirit of Christrsquos New Testament message of acceptance and love, all employees at the park are required to sign a ldquostatement of faith which explicitly prohibits them from employmenttheyrsquore ldquogay, bi, or a person who has attempted to alter gender by surgery or appearance.Itrsquos perhaps then no surprise that Ham also has a concurrent campaign to, ahem, ldquotake back the rainbow. Which was,we recall Sunday School storytime, first gted to the Earth by temperamental Old Testament tyrant Yahweh himself ndash in a plea for forgiveness after killing everyone in a pique of petulant fury at our so-called ldquosins, such as homosexuality and the like. Itrsquos certainly ironic that despite being heavily influenced by The Flintstones, Ham certainly wonrsquot ever tolerate a ldquogay old time.Jockrsquos on usSCOTS are, of course, children of the Enlightenment, sensibly secular of mind and progressively liberal enough to have earned a wee condescending chuckle at the backward beliefs of some of our American cousins.Despite all evidence to the contrary, however, many of us remain within the confines of this self-gratying bubble of ldquowharsquos like us  nonsense. The truth is, wersquore perhaps even more societally regressive than any dusty, confederate backwater in the American heartlands.In , MSP Alasdair Allan ndash who was the Minister for Learning, Science and Scotlandrsquos Languages ndash saw fit to officially respond to pressure from the militantly atheist Scottish Secular Society , boldly stating the obvious to his peers in Holyrood: ldquoGuidance provided by Education Scotland does not identy Creationism as a scientic principle. It should therefore not be taught as part of science lessons.And neither should enriching uranium yet no-onersquos banned that yet. So, perhaps with that in mind, Allan fell short of outlawing the teaching of a six-day creation period by a prankster transdimensional magician ndash adding a rather timorous postscript that any precedents of governmental intolerance would inevitably lead to ldquocalls for bans on other issues and the curriculum would risk becoming mired in legal arrangements.One wonders whether Allanrsquos a**e is still numb from such an awkward perch on the fence. His non-committal stance does, however, echo successive Scottish and UK governmentsrsquo deeply ingrained reluctance to condemn, or even recognise, the bleeding chasm of ision for which religious dogma is almost entirely responsible. Most folk free from the micro-management of thought caused by this ancient virus can clearly see its butterfly effect of societal paralysis, and on a micro scale, calcying the neurones of its host to protect itself against rival contagions ndash or any wildly idealistic notions of utopic unity and global harmony.That the sediment of fear and superstition remains the fundamental layer we build our communities and education system upon in  is bad enough, but the fact religionrsquos stagnated stench still clogs the corridors of power is surely the ultimate absurdity ndash with Scottish local authorities still being legally obliged to cower under the overriding authority of Tha Lawd on council education boards.Return of the JediITrsquoS a law that surely proves wersquore all either numbed within a collective hypnotic state or that reality truly is a simulation run by malevolent aliens ndash the absurd ruling that Scottish councils are still legally required to appoint three education committee members to represent a transdimensional creator skyspirit. Legally, all require one Catholic representative, one Church of Scotland and one ldquoother. Perhaps a Jedi would be appropriate ndash as therersquos more chance of a Darth Vader figure existing in an infinite universe than a temperamental creator with suspiciously human traits such as jealousy, fury and regret.Yet, despite the comedic costumes being a dead giveaway to their shoogly grasp on reality, the pious are somehow bestowed with entirely unearned respect and privilege in our society, particularly within the corridors of power ndash despite their myopic belief systems infecting every warped thought and utterance.Itrsquos surely right that we question why unelected purveyors of fancul fiction can operate freely from voter accountably and bear influence on how our children are educated. South Lanarkshire Councilrsquos Dr Nagy Iskander is one such presence ndash a creationist who has said that evolution is ldquoreally illogical.Incidentally, Iskander counts Ark Encounterrsquos Ken Ham as a personal friend ndash perhaps admiring how he has earned a very comfortable living by convincing the naive and desperate that his self-serving porkies are the gospel truth.And finally ...PERHAPS there really is no need to rush any official ban on teaching creationism in Scottish classrooms.It could be argued itrsquos putting the cart before the horse in a country where we still appoint believers in ancient Abrahamic superstitions to education boards ndash and continue to segregate children in accordance to parental allegiances to a supernatural entity who only ever existed in our speciesrsquo minds.At least our Kentuckian cousins donrsquot believe their omnipotent comfort blanket has any allegiance to a particular sports team. Just last week, ldquoProtestant ldquoCatholic and ldquowest of Scotland were among the highest trending terms on UK twitter.Perhaps The Flintstones has simply evolved into a social media reality show, starring yabba dabba you and me. Therersquos certainly no need to build an Ark Encounter theme park in a country populated and led by dinosaurs, already fully submerged and drowning in destructive delusions."},{"url":null,"title":"advice for supporters ahead of scottish cup game at pittodrie","story":"Police Scotland officers along with partners are preparing to welcome thousands of football fans to Aberdeen for the Scottish Cup Quarter Final this Sunday.Kick off for the Aberdeen and Rangers game is at .pm and so the City Centre, Pittodrie, Aberdeen Beach and Seaton areas will be busier than usual.Police ask that fans heading to the stadium plan their journeys in advance and allow themselves plenty of extra time to get to the stadium.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust. This is helpful in identying accident black spots and monitoring for environmental hazards and poisons, and potential wildle crime.\"Sunday  Mar  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Delay to Wick 20 mph speed limit plans","story":"THE brakes have been put on plans to introduce a  mph speed limit on the majority of roads in Wick.The proposal was mooted by Highland Council as a way to improve road safety and encourage walking and cycling.However, Wick members of the Caithness committee this week described the scheme as \"a blunt instrument\" and said other measures to reduce speed would be more effective.

The turnout was  per cent.Prospect has said it will consult representatives next week before confirming industrial action plans. The action is likely to start in April and continue through the summer.This situation arose after HIAL airport controllers sought a pay rise, as they said they were being paid half as much as their counterparts in other areas. However, HIAL said this isn#t the case and proposals were rejected by Scottish Ministers.Prospect negotiations officer David Avery said: “Our members at HIAL undertake highly skilled roles, much in demand across the UK and Europe, but due to public sector pay restraint their pay has fallen signicantly behind the rest of the industry.“Air Traffic Controllers do not want to have to take this action but ministers’ refusal to engage with the issue of pay has left them with no choice. Prospect remains ready to negotiate at any point to avoid this action but ministers must come back to the table with a new meaningful offer.”HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, has responded to news of the ballot, saying: “We are disappointed Air Traffic Controlcolleagues have chosen to take industrial action that is likely to have a signicant impact on passengers and the communities we serve in the Highlands and Islands.#The Prospect union has sought a double-digit pay award. As a government sponsored agency, HIAL must follow the Scottish Government pay policy. We cannot implement pay awards more than that directed by government.#HIAL made a pay award offer to all staff which was accepted following an overall ballot of trade union members and paid to all staff at the end of September .  This was backdated to  April  and saw colleagues receive increases of up to three per cent in line with Scottish Government Pay Remit Guidelines.#Prospect ATC members rejected the pay settlement, but nonetheless received the increase.#We are open to holding further talks with Prospect on a recruitment and retention allowance for Air Traffic Control staff that would further bolster an attractive remuneration package that already includes excellent pension benefits and holiday entitlements.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am not suggesting the Instagram photograph she posted with a random black child on her hip is unproblematic. MP David Lammy was right to point out it plays on all those tired old “white saviour” tropes. But Dooley is not just some C-list celebrity who has popped her head into Uganda to boost her own profile. She may currently be dancing on Strictly, but she is also a documentary maker with a track record of tackling serious subjects: sweat shops, people trafficking and child soldiers. Forcing her to take the flak for the cloying paternalism of Comic Relief seems harsh and lets an awful lot of other people off the hook.Thirty years after Live Aid, most people of my generation, who sang along with gusto to Do They Know It’s Christmas  cannot hear the line: “So tonight thank God it’s them instead of you” without a visceral sense of shame. We recognise, now, the flaws in the privileged pop stars’ approach: the way Live Aid treated the continent of Africa as homogeneous and its people as unormly helpless the way it presented Bob Geldof as a saint and relied on dehumanising shots of starving babies to guilt-trip comfortable First Worlders into donating.We understand – or at least we ought to – that this sort of relief effort risks disempowering those it purports to help and deflects from the UK’s role as an oppressor that plundered many benighted countries of their resources.Yet, despite this – and many high-profile calls for the West to confront the legacy of its imperial past – a sanitised and white-centred attitude towards racism and the developing world remains widespread.We saw it at this year’s Oscars. Two years after Moonlight, a sensitive portrayal of black masculinity, won best film, Hollywood suffered a relapse, handing the award to Green Book, a buddy movie – made by white director Peter Farrelly – in which a northern white bigot agrees to drive a brilliant, but repressed black musician on a tour of the Deep South. And guess what  The white driver is the main character. And the story is seen through his eyes. And it turns out he’s not so bad after all. He teaches the black musician about black culture. They listen to Little Richard and eat fried chicken. And, in the end, the lonely black musician celebrates Christmas with his driver’s big white Italian family. No wonder Spike Lee walked out in disgust.We see it too in the sixth-formers heading out to build clinics across the developing world. It’s all very well-intended, but – as they hold ceilidhs and race nights to fund their trips – do they ever stop to consider who benefits  Is it the local residents who could – with the money raised – have been trained to do construction work themselves  Or is it mostly about their own egos and CVs Founder Richard Curtis saw Comic Relief as Live Aid for comedians so of course it came with a similar condescending vibe. The very first one, at Christmas , saw Lenny Henry broadcasting from a refugee camp in the Sudan.The format was always excruciating. High jinks interspersed with war zones, cake sales interspersed with pot-bellied infants. Happy face sad face, like Alex the Lion in Madagascar .Not so long ago such comments would have you written off as po-faced and tight, but in recent years the backlash against “poverty porn” has grown. In , the Radi-Aid awards nominated three films, involving Tom Hardy, Eddie Redmayne and Ed Sheeran, for the title of most offensive campaign of the year. The one that attracted most attention was Sheeran’s Comic Relief video, in which the singer offered to pay hotel costs for street children in Liberia. Sheeran was presented as a Messiah figure, dispensing western largesse. In the wake of that controversy, Liz Warner, CEO of Comic Relief, which runs Sports Relief and Red Nose Day, pledged the organisation would change its ways, and push African voices to the fore. Last year, a film about street children in Kampala was introduced by Rio Ferdinand, but he did not appear in it. Instead, a Ugandan charity worker and the children explained the issues to the viewer.Unfortunately, Dooley’s Instagram pictures – and the charity’s response to Lammy’s criticism – suggest it has fallen back into its old ways. Instead of reflecting on the validity of the MP’s words, it accused him of failing to respond to its offer for him to go to Africa – again that generic reference to an entire continent – and make a film himself. This was defensive, untrue and missed the point. Lammy did respond, but declined the offer, which is understandable given he wasn’t asking Comic Relief to give a  to British politicians but to indigenous voices.The furore prompted many angry-from-Manchester types to rant on about a lack of gratitude, thus proving Lammy’s point: that the Comic Relief model requires humility and submission from its beneficiaries. In reality, no-one was suggesting the £bn-plus Comic Relief has raised was unnecessary or unwelcome just that there are ways to help developing countries that do not involve fetishising human suffering or ignoring our country’s complicity in their plight. If I were going to tackle the “white saviour” syndrome, I would start in schools and particularly with To Kill A Mocking Bird. With his liberal benevolence firmly rooted in privilege, Atticus Finch is the archetypal white saviour, whose fate takes precedence over that of Tom Robinson, the black man he unsuccessfully defends against  accusations of rape. As long as the politics of Harper Lee’s book go unchallenged in classrooms, her paternalistic perspective is likely to persist.Lammy’s solution is for Comic Relief to have African voices counter lazy stereotypes. One comedian he suggested the programme might promote is Kenyan-born Njambi McGrath. In a clipposted on his Twitter feed, McGrath suggests western backpackers who take off for the developing world are “detoxing from privilege”.“I hear you went to Africa my love,” she says. “Tell me, where in Africa did you go  Let me guess. Did you visit the medieval city built by the Shona people of Great Zimbabwe  Or perhaps maybe you went and spent some time in the ancient kingdom of the Baganda people  And they will say ‘I went to an orphanage. I went to a clinic for HIV sufferers, and I went to a slum’.”Dooley is not a villain. She shouldn’t be expected to carry the can for Comic Relief’s enduring colonialism. But perhapsshe and others were exposed to more voices like McGrath’s, they would think twice about treating black children like some sort of fashion accessory. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scots outlander fans to get chance to quiz creator diana gabaldon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Outlander fans are being offered the chance to quiz author Diana Gabaldon at a stately home that features in the hit TV show.The US writer will take part in a conversation event at Hopetoun House near South Queensferry on March .Fans will recognise the attraction from the screen adaptation of her historical time travel series, which concluded its fourth season in January.Author James Crawford will chair the evening in the Red Drawing Room, which appeared as the home of the Duke of Sandringham in series one.Outlander follows the adventures of English nurse Claire Randall, who travels back in time from s Scotland to the th century, where she meets and falls in love with Highlander Jamie Fraser.• : Outlander quiz: How well do you know the Scottish series The first book was published in  and it was adapted for television in .Fans of the series have since flocked from Europe and North America to visit locations featured in the show.The Hopetoun House event has been organised by VisitScotland and Publishing Scotland, with support from United Airlines.Jenni Steele from VisitScotland said: “The Outlander books and subsequent TV series have had a huge impact on tourism in Scotland, inspiring thousands of travellers to visit our shores.• : Outlander continues to drive record figures at Scotland’s heritage sites“It is only fitting that fans will get the chance to hear from the award-winning author in the sumptuous Hopetoun House, which will be familiar to viewers.”Marion Sinclair from Publishing Scotland added: “Books and storytelling have long been the source of cinematic and TV adaptations and Outlander is one of the major page-to-screen stories of the past decade in Scotland.“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to hear from Diana Gabaldon about how her writing served as the inspiration for the series.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"swimmer david wilkie should mere mortals like andy murray get knighthoods","story":"Scottish Olympian David Wilkie had hit out at the British honours system, claiming it has become a #personality cult#.The swimmer, who won five world records as well as gold in the Olympics, said the entire system had changed, with “mere mortals” like him, now getting knighthoods instead of less er honours.

Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now. Those responsible would be handed their Ps."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2109-28-September-12-150x150.jpg","title":"new skye gallery to bring celebrated artists studio back into","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe former studio of the late, much-loved and acclaimed artist Tommy MacKenzie was reopened as a new gallery space in Skye this week by a local businessman.Robert MacAskill, owner of the Relish Deli in Wentworth Street, Portree took on the studio following the passing of Mr MacKenzie in March last year and has decided to open it as the ‘Isle of Skye Gallery’, maintaining the space’s connection to the rich arts legacy set in place by the former Glasgow Print Studio member.Born in Shetland in , Tommy MacKenzie moved to Portree a year later and, after attending the local high school, he went on to study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee. In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland olympic hero dame mary peters further honoured by the queen","story":"Dame Mary, from Northern

The First Responders received its first donation on February . Braid Valley Vintage Enthusiasts presented the Scheme with a cheque for pound, for the purchase of two defibrillators and response packs.John Crothers presented the cheque to Stephen Lamont and Alan Murray, two of the team working to get the scheme operational by early summer. Alan Murray thanked them for their generosity and emphasised the importance of the new venture.“Last year in Northern Ireland there were almost  out of hospital cardiac arrests: an average of four a day. Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillation within  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Braid Valley Community First Responders aims to train and organise local people to respond to cardiac arrests in their own community while the ambulance is on its way and improve survival rates in Broughshane and Ballymena and the surrounding rural areas. This generous donation will be of great help to us in achieving our aim.”Stephen Lamont issued an appeal for local residents to ensure that their addresses were identiable.“Clear signage is vitalwe are to get to you quickly in a le threatening emergency. “Our plea is that you identy your house number or name clearly so that it can be read from the road. “ If you live up a shared drive, please talk to your neighbours and label the end of the drive with all the house numbers and ensure that each inidual house is numbered. “This will help us to help youyou are having an emergency.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1462209.jpg--.jpg?1550660974000\n","title":"moy park general manager shines a light on factory life","story":" AARON Whiteman has been with Moy Park for almost  years, working his way up from weekend sht worker to front line manager, to his current role as General Manager at the Ballymena site. As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles. A similar structure linking Denmark and Sweden will be used as a guide when investigating the logistics of the bridge.Ian Paisley welcomed the positive discussions.He said: “This move from a Red Light to an Amber Light shows progress and is encouraging for a future Green Light on the bridge project.”Speaking to the , Mr Paisley added: “This is a matter I have raised at our select committee and now the transport secretary is taking this forward to find a way of supporting a feasibility study. “That would be a signicant move and would be most welcome.“Obviously this is at an early stage but it wouldn’t take a blind man on a galloping horse to miss the opportunities for employment commerce and tourism!“Any feasibility study would have to look at where the bridge would leave NI and enter the mainland all of that will now need to be considered.“As a unionist it’s very obvious to see the added attraction of linking our kingdom in this physical way.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

They visited a mix of work-based credit unions and community credit unions to provide much-needed technical assistance, especially in rural districts of the Bwiam region.The technical assistance provided by Rosaleen and the coaches included providing support to Gambian credit union staff on day-to-day operations, loan management and credit control.Following each credit union visit Rosaleen and Michael had the opportunity to meet with their Boards and put forward recommendations on how to further develop their credit union .Rosaleen and the coaches also organised for a meeting with local taxi drivers to discuss the potential of them setting up their own credit union.At the end of the visits the coaches hosted a two-day workshop for credit union personnel in Banjul. This allowed for the coaches to discuss credit union issues and share their knowledge with the participants.Rosaleen presented on the topic of governance to the participants.Throughout the two weeks Rosaleen and her fellow volunteers were able to share their skills and knowledge to build the capacity of the credit union personnel in The Gambia and empower them to further strengthen their movement.Rosaleen also had the opportunity to meet credit union members and hear about how the credit union is making a real dference in their lives.The Irish credit union movement is highly regarded across the world and the visit by the Irish coaches was hugely appreciated by the credit union movement in The Gambia.Speaking about her visit, Rosaleen said: “I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of Newington Credit Union who have supported the ILCU Foundation for many years.“To be able to visit one of the countries which benefit from our support and come back and share my experience enables me to highlight the needs of small rural communities who live in abject poverty.“In facing such conditions the people remain cheerful and are always smiling – hence the name given to The Gambia: the Smiling Coast of Africa. The Gambian credit union volunteers and staff are so keen to enhance their knowledge and skills to develop their credit unions and I hope in the coming years they go from strength to strength.“I would like to thank my fellow coaches, the ILCU Foundation and NACCUG who helped make the trip so successful. ”Baboucarr Jeng, General Manager NACCUG, expressed his thanks to Rosaleen and the coaches for giving their time to help the credit unions in The Gambia and he emphasised the need for the participants “to use the education from the training to develop their skills and the credit unions they represent”.Alan Moore, CEO ILCU Foundation, added: “It has been great to have Rosaleen on board for our coaching programme for the past two years, she has been a fantastic ambassador for the ILCU Foundation and indeed the wider Irish credit union movement.“Throughout the course of her time in The Gambia, our partner credit unions have learnt a great deal from Rosaleen and her fellow coaches.“We are very grateful to Rosaleen for giving up her time to volunteer to help our partners, who, like Rosaleen, know the value of having a credit union and what it means for the members.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Newington Credit Union who supported Rosaleen to participate in the Coaching Programme and for their continued support to the ILCU Foundation’s work.”Newington Credit Union.- Duncairn Gardens,Belfast,BT GF.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"full steam ahead for carryduff gaelscoil","story":"THE committee of a new Irish-medium nursery school in Carryduff has said it is confident it will open its doors as planned despite losing out on a proposed school building.The new naíscoil is expected to open in September this year and will pave the way for an Irish-medium primary in the area in .Gaelscoil an Aodha Dhuibh faced a setback recently after a lease on the proposed nursery site fell through. However, committee member Suzanne Warring said she is confident it will open as planned.“We’re looking at everything that is available in the whole postcode,” she said.“There are very few commercial properties in the area, but we have seen everything that there is, so we’re reaching out to everyone to make sure we get an appropriate site. “At this stage we are still confident we will be opening in September. My daughter is one of the ones who will be going to the school in September and we certainly expect that to happen. Over the next couple of weeks we hope to get the building secured and then we will have enough time to prepare. Because we have the money in place and all of the groundwork has been done in advance, we should be able to open as planned.”According to Ms Warring, the naíscoil has already had an unprecedented amount of applications, which are indicative of a growing demand for Irish-medium education in the area.“It is massively encouraging,” she enthused.“To think that your kids can go to a local naíscoil, bunscoil, or meánscoil in the future is fantastic. It really shows how much things have changed here. The naiscoil is the start and we hope to build on that. We’re trying to build a community around it. There are a lot more Irish speakers in the area than we would have known and it will create a place for those people, and for those who just want to learn.”She continued: “Because of the non-denominational ethos of Irish medium education, we welcome applications from everyone in the community and the inclusive, child-centred nature of Irish medium is exactly what the area needs. “We had an amazing turnout at The Ivanhoe in December for our information morning. Many parents don#t have Irish themselves but we know from the success of our existing Gaelscoileanna that this is not an issue. “The momentum is there and the funding is ready to go. “The committee is working diligently to secure suitable premises to open the doors in September  as planned.

We have to be aware that driver safety, passenger safety is what is important it’s about building confidence. I have to be on the ground with inspectors to build up that confidence. “If anything happens at least I am there, I can identy people because at the end of the day what is happening here is a serious offence, young people could end up with a criminal record here,” he said. “We are looking towards sustainability, working together with the community, Translink, the union, working on a strategy to prevent this from happening ever again.

The impacts of the ious campaigns have been extensively debated, but certain events, such as the republican struggle against criminalisation in the H-Blocks and Armagh Gaol, are almost universally recognised as catalytic in effecting social change. While we know the blanket protest and the deaths of  men on hunger strike would completely alter the political landscape in Ireland, the lived experiences of the blanket men and women and the horror they endured is much harder to comprehend.As part of wider effort to tell the prisoners’ stories, ex-prisoner Seamus Kearney, who is one of hundreds of people who experienced the ordeal of the H-Blocks, is set to give a talk on his time in prison in St Gall’s GAC on Friday.Seamus was arrested during an IRA operation in Finaghy Road North and was imprisoned in January . He was placed on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol where he admits he was looking forward to some rest after years of struggle, but he didn’t know what to expect.His imprisonment coincided with the building of the H-Blocks, where the first blanket man, Kieran Nugent, had begun his protest against criminalisation just three months earlier. At that time, however, Seamus said, “Nobody knew what way the jails were going.” Indeed, during an early encounter with Kieran Doherty, who would die on hunger strike in , he was informed that his comrades were “disappearing off the face of the earth” after sentence. After his own sentencing, Seamus was moved from the Crumlin Road to H-Block  in June . It was there that he first met future hunger strikers Kevin Lynch, Thomas McElwee and the then block OC, Bobby Sands. During their short time in H, which was then used as a transitional block, Seamus and his comrades resolved to join the blanket protest. Non-conformity meant being locked in a cell for  hours a day and a ‘Number ’ starvation diet.“After refusing a unorm you were told to strip ‘everything’,” he said. “It was all men looking at you, so it was a bit weird. They put the clothes into a brown bag and I remember thinking to myself ‘I’m going to get them back.’“It seemed quite daunting because I thought I was getting some R and R,” he added.“We ended up in H and took each day as it came. One day led to another. Your legs start getting tingly from the lack of exercise, but the idea was to keep walking to keep moving. “After a few months, we were lucky, because at the end of January  Brendan Hughes, ‘The Dark’, arrived. I ended up in cell next to him. Bobby ended up at the far wing of H. Getting Brendan Hughes was amazing. He was already a hero, even then.”According to Seamus, the arrival of Brendan Hughes, who took up command in the blocks, was pivotal in the escalation of the prison protests. The blanket men were isolated from the outside world and the British government was “winning the propaganda war”, but with the men voting in favour of Brendan Hughes’ idea of no-wash protest in February , the protest began gaining public attention.“We needed to recalibrate,” Seamus said.“It was then that we were told that this was not a local jail dispute. This was a part of governmental policy and that it was bigger than we thought. I think the Brits thought we weren’t of the same calibre of Connolly or Pearse – that we would do what we were told. But they were wrong. They were hitting a raw nerve and they didn’t realise it, and maybe we didn’t. We weren’t thinking about what it all meant, but our backs were against the wall.”Seamus continued: “It was about attracting national international interest. We had to open new lines of communication to the outside world and get our story out there, because at that time they were winning the propaganda war.“We were already getting harassed on the way out of our cells, so The Dark said we were going to exploit that going into the no-wash protest. The screws were already beating some of the lads. You were going out one cell at a time and it was one man being hit by about  screws.”Seamus was soon moved to H where he lost Brendan Hughes’ counsel, but said he and his comrades were emboldened at the onset of the no-wash protest. Their ingenuity in sending communications within the blocks and to the outside world is now legendary. It was during that time, amid increasing brutality from the screws, that the prisoners took the decision to smear excrement on walls – a decision that Seamus said was taken reluctantly.“We didn’t know how we would even do it – the mechanics of it,” he said.“We were improvising again. Some bright spark, Tom Martin, had the idea of taking a piece of the mattress and using it as a sponge. That seemed to be the only way to do it. Eventually we did it together. We started smearing it on the wall – it was horrible. After about two weeks the screws went ballistic. I remember the screw opening the cell door and saying ‘you dirty bastards – you fucking animals.’ I think that’s when the real hatred started forming. We didn’t feel good about putting it up anyway. We weren’t animals, but we felt that we had to do it to highlight the case.”Seamus recalls  as bad year for the blanket men, particularly in ‘an seachtain dona’of April that year, when “people were literally beaten off the blanket”. He said the remaining blanket men were determined to “save the IRA from obliteration” and, often, it was comedy that got them through. While you were getting beaten you were still laughing,” he recalled. Seamus tells with a smile of a visit from an old neighbour who cajoled him into singing ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’ by Bryan Ferry – a move that brought applause from the visiting room and, later, a beating from the screws. Needless to say, she never visited again.While the torture endured by the blanket men was immense, Seamus faced one of his toughest challenges when he received word that the IRA had executed his brother, Michael Kearney, as an informer in July . The screws initially mocked his brother’s death, but later offered supposed salvation and a chance to leave the blanket. Michael’s name would not be cleared until  when it was revealed that he had been killed at the behest of IRA informant Freddie Scappaticci, codename Stakekne. However, Seamus remained undaunting in his commitment to the IRA during his  years in prison. “I gave him my blessing to join the IRA,” he said.“I felt he betrayed me and he betrayed Ireland. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Everything stood still.“I was in the middle of no-man’s land. I was neither with the IRA or the British and I felt shell-shocked. The first thing that went through my mind was ‘What am I going to tell the lads ’“It was the first time I realised the distinction between mind and body, which you’ll not understand until it happens,” he added.“My body was telling me I’d had enough – I was starving, I had lice, I had dysentery – but my mind was saying, ‘Tell themto fuck off.’ “I told them I had lots of brothers. There were  of them, one of them was dead, but I had Sean on the outside and I had brothers in the H-Blocks.“I told the lads that the only way they would take me out isthey carried me out. They weren’t going to break the back of the IRA.”The H-Blocks saw a hunger strike in  that saw the British government renege on a deal it had struck with the prisoners. Tragically,  men – Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Thomas McElwee and Michael Devine – died on hunger strike the following year. Of the  that died, Seamus knew six of them personally, and he vividly recalls the last time he saw Bobby Sands during Mass in February .“At the end of the Mass Bobby went round the lads clockwise,” he said.“He came to me and smiled and said ‘I see you’re still here,’ and I knew it was in relation to our Michael. I said ‘There’s nowhere  to go, Bobby.’ He looked straight into my eyes and said ‘Good man – goodbye.’“I had doubted him. Most of our wing had doubted him. To me he was just like a Rod Stewart lookalike. I had given him the words to ‘This Old Heart of Mine’ before – he liked that song. When I looked into his eyes that Sunday they were like a shark’s eyes. He had resigned himself and I knew he was going to go through with.“The hunger strike was a formality. Bobby didn’t really die on May the th – he died in February. One after another they died and it was like losing a part of yourself. It was the same reaction I had to losing our Michael. It was like losing brothers. It was so catastrophic – and it still is. “Maybe it’s a physiological thing that I don’t understand, but when I talk about it I can still feel that emotion asit was yesterday and I still struggle to get over it. I know I speak for a lot of the lads who can’t have this conversation, but something broke inside me.”Those who knew the men who died most keenly feel the sadness of . For Seamus, the death of his friend Thomas McElwee, who he knew from H, was most dficult of all, and one that he finds most painful to speak about. He talks about his friend fondly, and will no doubt do so as he tells his own chapter in the dramatic account of the blanket men. “You are trying to bring people into that world and a lot of the lads can’t talk about it – most of them don’t,” he said.“For me, you don’t just talk about the protest, you actually relive it. Once you open that Pandora’s box you don’t know what you’re letting out, so a lot of the lads keep it closed.“Today, with the rise of Sinn Féin, the republican movement is healthy. It is a direct result of the fight against criminalisation. We thought it would be a footnote in Irish history, but it became a pivotal moment. Of the ten men who died on hunger strike I knew six of them personally. It was such an intimate death for all of them that it’s dficult to talk about.”Seamus will give his talk about le on the blanket in St Galls GAC this Friday evening, March , at .pm. All are welcome to come along."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit boost for pm as tories indicate support amid backstop move optimism","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is a sport,\" he added.\"Ive also been surprised just at the level of disorder on display at some of the matches and we have been concerned, particularly over the last  months that there has been a rise in both disorder, that type of offensive behaviour and the levels of aggression to police officers.\"Meanwhile, earlier this week footage emerged of a group of people singing that they hoped Brendan Rodgers would be murdered by the IRA.Images emerged of Celtic supporters in a pub singing that they hoped their former manager takes \"a bullet from the IRA\".The incident reportedly took place in an Edinburgh bar.On Thursday police Scotland said they were aware of footage posted to social media. It followed Tuesdays announcement that the Carnlough man had left the managers job at Celtic Park to take over at Leicester City.Speaking at a Leicester City Press conference yesterday, Rodgers said moving to the Premier League club was a dficult decision, but one that was \"too good to turn down\".\"It wasnt easy.

Brummies love it. We can all move on from this discussion now, I will be taking no further questions. pic dQRbgUAO— James FeltonMarch , “I’ve been drinking it since I was a child and had the metabolism to cope with the calories involved,” he told the Press Association.Since a discussion between Mr Felton and some of his friends on Twitter about the drink on Friday, talk about milk coke has surged, with the drink receiving mixed reviews.Tried my first milk coke after learning about it on Twitter earlier today. I expected it to be bad, but I have to say my expectations were completely right. Its not good. I do not recommend mixing coke and milk— Wild GeertersMarch , Twitter user @classiclibral commented: “I expected it to be bad, but I have to say my expectations were completely right. It’s not good.

It’s a Brummie thing.”So how to drink milk coke  Well, Mr Felton says the best mixture is one third milk to two thirds coke.“You have to pour the milk in first otherwise it’ll curdle,” he added. “You’ve got about  minutes to drink it once you’ve made it, before it separates.“And trust me, you do not want to drink a separated milk coke.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Felton recommends people try milk coke “because it’s delicious” and has “all the flavour of a coke float without the hassle of having to own ice cream”.But he also offers some words of caution.“It definitely shouldn’t be a craze, I don’t want to give the whole UK diabetes,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"malaysia open to proposals to resume","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And, it was just before his arrival in Derry for the visit that he learned of the surfacing of the British document in question.In August,  Martin Galvin led a group of  Americans on a fact-finding tour of the North organised by Sinn Fein. The tour included a two-day tour of Derry.The arrival of the U.S. delegation attracted major press coverage in Ireland and America. The visit also coincided with the annual anti-internment rallies after which British Minister Nicholas Scott, a close associate of Margaret Thatcher, issued a public statement saying he regretted not being given the opportunity to speak to the U.S. contingent and set them straight.Martin Galvin said: \"We immediately replied that were still in the north and were willing and available to meet with the British official.\"But, Scott was immediately recalled back to London from Belfast and a statement was released that British officials did not speak to anyone affiliated with Irish Northern Aid, or who believed that IRA resistance to British rule at the time and in those circumstances was morally legitimate.\"However, Unioinist MP Martyn Smyth appeared with me on a UTV program and said our tour represented a blinkered view of the conflict because the delegation hadnt met with British officials or unionists.\"The following year, Martin Galvin, by then editor of an Irish-American newspaper in New York, organised a second tour which this time consisted of  Americans. It was again planned to coincide with an anti-interment rally on August , .Martin Galvin continued: \"On July ,  I wrote a letter from my office at the Irish People, offering the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and unionist leaders an opportunity to speak to us at a mutually agreed time and venue. It was a genuine offer made in response to both Nicholas Scotts and Rev Smyths public comments the year before.\"However, the British response to the offer to talk was to have then Home Secretary Leon Brittan issue an Exclusion Order against Martin Galvin at Cabinet level on the eve of the American delegations arrival in Ireland.\"Its been speculated that the ban was payback because I was in charge of American support for the hunger strikers in . But, a pretext was also added that months before at the rededication of the United Irishmen Roddy McCorley monument in Toome I had made a fairly commonplace remark that I was glad there were still men and women who carried on in the spirit of Roddy McCorley to be free,\" Martin Galvin said.However, the recent emergence of a previously classied Northern Ireland Officememo dated July ,  makes no reference to an exclusion order nor any concerns about allegedly inflammatory remarks in support of the IRA campaign from Galvin.The Exclusion Order against the American was however issued the next day-July , .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe NIO memo, signed by a JM Lyon, states: \"You may have seen that Martin Galvin had secured some publicity for his request to the Secretary of State and the Unionist parties for a meeting with the NORAID party when they visit Northern Ireland next month.\"I suggest the letter receive a short Private Secretary reply.\"I suggest Mr Barriemight inform Washington of this correspondence and let them know the terms of our reply when it has been sent.\"I suggest we do not ourselves issue the text to the press either here or in America, but should make it availableasked with the thought that this is a propaganda ploy at its most transparent.\"In view of the imminence of the visit, it would be helpfulcolleagues could let me have any comments, by telephone inconvenient, by close of business on  July.\"Martin Galvin said: \"Instead of intimidating or silencing the delegation the ban had the opposite reaction. Sinn Fein leaders had learned of the ban and told me it was important that I defied it because it would highlight censorship.\"I agreed to defy the ban and I was photographed in Derry beside Martin McGuinness to prove Id been in the North.\"When we went onto Belfast on August , the RUC had planned a brutal retaliation. Gerry Adams called me onto the  to speak at the anti-internment rally the RUC immediately fired plastic bullets and baton charged a peaceful crowd. They murdered Sean Downes and injured many more.\"But, like Bloody Sunday, the number of cameras, journalists and witnesses meant that British violence couldnt be covered up.\"The following year, , Galvin again defied the ban and appeared in Derry once more carrying the coffin of an IRA member.And, in August  on the th anniversary of the arrival of British troops in Derry, Martin Galvin was arrested at Free Derry Corner whilst accompanied by Martin McGuinness.After being held at Strand Road RUC barracks he was shipped to a military base in England before being deported to Washington on a British military aircraft.\"It after this incident that the British Government announced that the Exclusion Order was being withdrawn. Ironically, I was told of this by Denis Donaldson who had been sent to America and who was obviously targeting me.\"Speaking of the -year-old episode, Martin Galvin told the Derry News: \"The ban against me was simply one more of the countless examples of British officials imposing petty and arrogant policies behind some noble cover story and then being surprised that anyone would refuse to bow to their edicts.\"We were trying to show Americans what British rule was like for nationalists in the six counties.\"I think its ironic that I was made aware of this British document just as I was traveling to Derry with another American delegation. When we met in the Guildhall with eight councillors and Deputy Mayor Derek Hussey, I referred to the memo and noted that the last time I brought an American delegation to the north and requested a meeting with the British and unionists I had been sent an Exclusion Order in reply.\"CAPTION: Martin Galvin being arrested by the RUC at Free Derry Corner in . The late Martin McGuinness can be seen on the fringe of the left handside of the phoptograph."},{"url":null,"title":"mobuoy toxic dump clean dependent funding says government department","story":"A government department has said that remediation works at the Mobuoy Road “toxic super dump” in Derry will not commence unless funding is secured.The comments made by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairscome ahead of a scheduled community meeting at Drumahoe Primary School on March  at which people have been encouraged to demand answers and a clean-up of the site after years of inaction.The Mobuoy Road waste site consists of two distinct parcels of land, namely the City Industrial WasteSite and the Campsie Sands and Gravelssite – situated .km east of Derry and occupying a signicant  hectares of land – the equivalent of  rugby pitches.It has been acknowledged by environmental experts that the illegal dump poses serious risks to the River Faughan, which runs alongside it, and supplies % of the city’s drinking water.Eamonn McCann has been vocal about the urgent need for a clean-up operation over the years and raised Mobuoy in his first speech at Stormont as an MLA.  He also said that people were aware of illegal activities at the site.Yesterday, Mark H. Durkan MLA described it as a “ticking time bomb” which could turn a “huge environmental crime” into an “even bigger environmental crisis”.Previous waste management activities on the CIW site include an old landfill regulated by the legacy Derry City Council.At the stakeholder meeting on November , , the estimated volume of controlled waste illegally disposed at the Mobuoy waste site was reported to be a minimum of , m.The nature of the illegal deposits includes municipal waste, construction and demolitionwaste and municipal waste mixed with CD waste.Both the CIW site and CSG site have been subject to illegal waste disposal activities, according to local council officials.Paul Hughes has been a member of the Mobuoy Road Stakeholders Forum which has been meeting at regular intervals over the past number of years.The forum is made up of local youth and community representatives, elected representatives as well as members of the River Faughan Anglers.‘Justice for Mobuoy’At recent meetings remediation options have been explored and outlined by the Northern Ireland Environmental Agency in terms of cleaning up this illegal toxic “super dump” - which is understood to be one of the biggest illegal landfills in all of Europe.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMr Hughes said: “We are continuously told that that the Department is working towards cleaning up the dump. Its time to make it happen. At a recent meetingthe Councils Environment  Regeneration Committee the officer charged with heading up the clean-up said that they have been lucky with Mobuoy so far. What a statement to make.“Mobuoy Dump must be cleaned up without further delay. The floods of August  proved just how fragile the situation is.  The River Faughan remains under constant threat from pollution.“We should all be concerned about the issue.  We must all stand up for the Faughan.  I would encourage everyone to get along to this meeting and ask questions. I would suggest that everyone writes down all their questions and puts them directly to the NIEA on Wednesday th of March.”He added: “Our elected representatives have failed Mobuoy and have failed the River Faughan.  Despite a public inquiry having been unanimously agreed back in , it never ever happened.“Its time for concerned citizens to take control of this process and now is the time to demand that Mobuoy Dump be cleaned up once and for all and lessons learnt do that a disaster like this is never allowed to happen again.“It’s time to stand up for the River Faughan.  Make a point to attending this meeting, demand answers, demand a full clean up, demand a public inquiry. Its time to get Justice for Mobuoy!”‘Subject to funding’When asked what would need to be done to make the area safe and prevent any risk of contaminating the DAERA said would be dependent on funding.A spokesperson explained: “The Northern Environment Agency has agreed an integrated approach for remediating the Mobuoy illegal waste sites that takes full account of the need to protect the River Faughan.“At this stage DAERA through the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, is seeking to enforce the former operators to remediate. In parallel to this, DAERA is developing a signicant business case to support remediation of the site.“The solution is not a simple one. The protection of the River Faughan needs to be managed through a remediation programme that comprises of several complementary phases in which there are a number of treatments on site within each phase of works. All elements of this programme will need to be supported by an extensive environmental monitoring programme.“At this stage, the remediation programme is subject to DAERA securing funding for the preparatory works required prior to remediation commencing on site.”Further detail will be presented by NIEA to the local community at an event on Wednesday th March at .pm in Drumahoe Primary School.Photo: Environmental Campaigners Paul Hughes  Eamonn ODonnell at the Environmental Gathering rally in Derry last October."},{"url":null,"title":"people profit accuses sinn fein touch reality welfare reforms","story":"People Before Profit has accused Sinn Féin of being out of touch with the reality of welfare reforms.People Before Profit candidate for Foyleside Shaun Harkin said Universal Credit has left people in debt and poverty, while denying thousands disability benefits.He commented: \"Sinn Féin MLA Karen Mullan has called for the Department of Communities to ensure welfare mitigations continue.

As everyone knows, Dromara is a strong club but this year surpassed all expectations with the club being the only one in Ireland to have its members win two INFC Nationals.N Black  Son won the Friendship National and N Edgar  Son won the Skibbereen National.The Edgar partnership had a fantastic young bird season as well, winning the NIPA Young Bird National from Rosscarbery.N Black  Son also won the NIPA section D Old Bird Channel fancier. Russell Brothers also had another great season winning the highly prized McBride Cup for the channel averages plus winning Penzance Classic.C  L Fryers had the first bird from Dromara in the Kingrsquos Cup. McKinstry Brothers had some great results along with T Marshall  Son, first bird in Penzance Young Bird, D McCandless Yearling National winner.Mr  Mrs Stevenson again did well inland as well as beating the big boys on the channel by winning first Tallbenny.H Silcock had some great positions and were unlucky to be fourth open Friendship National and still be only second in the club.After the prizes and trophies were handed out Mrs Rooney presented Fiona Stevenson with a bouquet of flowers mdash a small token of thanks for the hospitality from her and Bobby throughout the year.As usual, the highlight of the evening was the ballot and with Stanley McKinstry not attending this year his luck was taken up by Fiona Stevenson.In fact they won so many young birds Bobby thought he might not even have to breed any of his own. N Edgar  Son and N Black  Son kindly donated two young birds each.Edgarrsquos two were won by new member Chris Rooney and Mr  Mrs Stevenson and Blackrsquos two young birds were won by Gordon Kirkpatrick and Mr  Mrs Stevenson.C  l Fryersrsquo young bird was won by non-fancier William Skelly, who is putting it into the stable of N Black  Son to be raced.Cromie  Magee and Sonsrsquo was won by Russell Bros, Mr  Mrs Stevensonrsquos by Chris Rooney, Russell Bros by H Silcock, T Marshall  Sonrsquos by Mr  Mrs Stevenson and A Bradleyrsquos was won by P Connor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Conal Montgomery samples new sound  ","story":"KILLYLEAGH rocker Conal Montgomery is working on new original music for the first time in years.The well-known singer who has performed at bikersrsquo rallies and conventions around the UK for the last  years may surprise some of his fans with his new sound.Instead of the soaring progressive rock vocals he is known for, Conalrsquos new music is softer, more reflective folk style.The  year-old says that his new music is indicative of where he is in his personal le now.The  year-old explained: ldquoI havenrsquot felt like this for years particularly as when I was drinking I really couldnrsquot be bothered with writing music.ldquoI wrote songs in the early s but alcohol and drugs just took over my le and my time was wasted.ldquoFor  odd years I didnrsquot do anything and now that Irsquom sober, I just have a love for it. I just want to try and put out what Irsquove been feeling for a long time.Conal first developed a love for music by listening to his big brotherrsquos Elvis Presley records.He later began to perform as the lead singer with the local band Bone Idle before moving on to Freak Out and then to Sweet Leaf mdash the band he fronted for  years.ldquoIrsquove been fronting rock bands for the last  years since my early twenties and it was always just covers like AC DC, Led Zeppelin and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Conal continued.ldquoBut when I started to write music, that wasnrsquot what was coming out of me. It was more singer songwriter, folky stuff.ldquoIt wasnrsquot really a surprise to me as the stuff I would have listened to outside my giging would have been the likes of Bob Dylan and Steve Earle.Conal is recording his new songs with the band Stillwater, which also features Killyleagh musician Damien Hanna.While he is experiencing a creative purple patch, the father-of-four does not yet know when the music will be available.ldquoI donrsquot have a title for my new EP yet as Irsquom still writing and Irsquom still recording. I would hope that the EP would be out by the summer and the album by the end of the year but you never know, the EP could turn into the album.He and Stillwater performed two of Conalrsquos new tracks, Venus and All of the People, in an interview on That Like That on NVTV.Conal says that the second track is really resonating with people.ldquoThis track is aimed at society in general, not only young people on Facebook, but all those who point the finger at somebody and gang up on some poor soul, he explained.ldquoThen when something happens to that poor soul, then yoursquoll get the smiley faces and comments of lsquoHe was a great fellarsquo or lsquoShe was a great girlrsquo and hopefully it teaches them a lesson to realise what people might be going through on the inside.Conal is a regular at Denvirrsquos in Downpatrick and will next perform with Stillwater in Portrush Town Hall at the North West  in MayTo watch Conalrsquos interview and performance on NVTVrsquos Talk Like That visit twww.nvtv shows talk-like-that-conal-montgomery Conal and Stillwater on their Facebook pages or ring Conal on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"De La Salle head ‘disappointed’ at decision  ","story":"THE principal of De La Salle School in Downpatrick has spoken of his ldquodisappointment in this weekrsquos statement from the Red High Parents and Friends Association.Mr Ciaran Maguire called on all four schools earmarked for the proposed lsquosuper schoolrsquo in Downpatrick ldquoto come together and put their best foot forward.Mr Maguire said he was disappointed for the trustees of De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos, who ldquohave given so much of their lives to the families in East Down.He described their involvement in education has been one of ldquogreat success and achievement.Mr Maguire said De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos were ldquotwo highly effective schools meeting the needs of young men and women in the greater Downpatrick area.He said the trustees had the confidence of staff, pupils and parents at De La Salle and from the wider business community.Mr Maguire remarked: ldquoWithin my last two years as principal of De La Salle, I have witnessed on a daily basis children going to and from St Patrickrsquos, to St Maryrsquos to De La Salle, accessing a curriculum that isnrsquot possible within their own school and sharing both the knowledge and expertise from each of these schools, where the results have been nothing short of excellent for each pupil.ldquoThis collaboration has been up and running successfully for years and is a model of good practice for other post-primary schools to see.ldquoWhat is wrong in having a rsquosuper schoolrsquo  Do the families in the greater Downpatrick area not deserve it  A school where children regardless of ability can achieve their potential He continued: ldquoThe new school will cater for every child. No child will be disadvantaged or be selected to attend this new school. For once they will have control over their choice of post-primary education.ldquoWhat is proposed is a Catholic school, with a strong Catholic Lasallian ethos. No child will be turned away because of not making the threshold grade. They will wear the same unorm, access the same curriculum and extracurricular activities and be treated with the same care and respect that they currently receive in their respective schools.Mr Maguire added: ldquoThis is something that very few communities in Northern Ireland can avail of.

When it did so, there was more debate around NIO minister John Penrose and Labour’s shadow minister Stephen Pound’s early years in politics – with Mr Penrose recounting how he “ate a great deal of curry” in Ealing – than there was about the legislation, so uncontroversial was its nature. No Northern Ireland MP even spoke in the Commons debate.The limited Westminster debate about the Northern IrelandRegulations  is hardly a great surprise.Even contentious Northern Ireland legislation can sail through almost empty Westminster chambers with unanimous support from the few MPs or peers who turn up.And in this case the legislation was not even seen as controversial, but as a regrettable but unavoidable outworking of the inability of the DUP and Sinn Féin to agree to restore devolution in Belfast.The striking thing was the reaction in Northern Ireland.There were no demonstrations against the move, no calls for an urgent meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and not even a press release from Sinn Féin or the SDLP to register perfunctory criticism of another act of direct rule sending more power back to London.Even in the perpetually outraged and hyper-partisan world of social media the decision passed with more comment on Lord Duncan’s vocal abilities than on the substance of how the law was being changed.This is not an isolated case. For more than a year now there has been a plethora of direct rule legislation – inidual acts of direct rule rather than a simpler and more far-reaching decision to suspend devolution and give all Stormont’s powers to the secretary of state.The legislation passed last week allows Mrs Bradley to appoint the attorney general, a member of the Victims’ Commission, a member or chair of the Livestock and Meat Commission or a member, chair or vice-chair of the Housing Executive. join MPs and women impacted by Northern Irelands strict abortion laws on Westminster Bridge in London.

But theof a key policing and justice power – the appointment of a local attorney general – to London made it a potentially sensitive statutory instrument.With the agreement of Parliament, Mrs Bradley had already taken to herself the power to appoint senior police officers, members of the Probation Board, members of the Policing Board and the highly sensitive role of police ombudsman. The ability to appoint members of the Judicial Appointments Commission – the body which appoints judges – had already gone to the Lord Chancellor in London last year.It is now routine for the secretary of state to decide on Stormont’s budget and pass it by direct rule at Westminster. And next month she will use another act of direct rule to slash the subsidies being paid to RHI claimants.Cumulatively, these and other acts of direct rule mean that power is seeping from Stormont – where now even civil servants will not be taking the decisions – to London.The general indference, or grudging support, of most people – whether unionist, nationalist or other – to these moves is potentially signicant.Government and civil service sources have privately said that a reason for not implementing full fat direct rule – as happened on every other past occasion when devolution collapsed – was concern about the reaction of nationalism.There was also probably concern about the Irish Government’s reaction at a time when the Brexit negotiations were ongoing and then, since summer , the complicating factor of the DUP’s deal to keep Theresa May in power.It is still possible that a move to implement full direct rule – especiallyit was seen to allow the DUP unique influence over how Northern Ireland is run – would grab the attention of a hitherto apathetic public and could anger nationalists.But the evidence so far is that the numerous acts of direct rule to date have provoked virtually no controversy at all - even from those such as Sinn Féin who would be expected to publicly oppose them out of ideological principle, evenquietly acquiescing in what is happening.It is almost certainly the case that there is no grand plan from either the secretary of state or the prime minister to incrementally institute direct ruleStormont cannot be recovered.What she is doing is arguably not even the bare minimum to keep the most essential wheels of government turning in Northern Ireland. Mrs Bradley has, for instance, repeatedly rejected the uncontroverisal pleas of the survivors of historical institutional abuse for her to use direct rule powers to provide them with compensation.Perhaps the reason that Sinn Fein in particular, but also the SDLP, have been so quiet is that neither of them have a viable alternative to the inexorable sht of power from Stormont to London.Both parties – and the Irish Government – initially proposed using the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conferenceto replace Stormont, a sort of back-door joint authority whereby London and Dublin jointly run Northern Ireland. But the Belfast Agreement precludes the BIIGC from dealing with devolved matters, something which Simon Coveney articulated clearly last July.Since then there have been no viable alternatives put forward by Sinn Féin as to how Northern Ireland should be governedit cannot agree to share power with the DUP at Stormont.On Tuesday, Thereported that the government is likely to reintroduce direct rulethere is a no-deal Brexit. The paper said that several Irish Government sources had confirmed that Dublin is aware of the plans, “which have been suggested as an administrative necessity rather than a political move” due to the need for rapid legislative and executive decision-making in such a scenario.If that does happen, it could leave Sinn Fein in an philosophically weak position unless it can propose a realistic alternative whereby urgent decisions can be taken.try catch  TrendingMomo contacts N.I. man -

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A consultation is being held on the councilrsquo website, while a drop-in session was held atSt Augustinersquos Parish Hall on January . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Queen stepped in ahead of Georgersquos birth to issue aLetters Patent to ensure all the Cambridgesrsquo children would have fitting titles, but this royal baby is much further down the line of succession.Under George Vrsquos rules, Harry and Meghanrsquos child and any future children would eventually become princes or princesses when Charles becomes king, because they would be the children of a son of a sovereign.So even though the baby will be quite far down the line of succession, the Queen may decide to introduce the titles early so they do not have to be changed later on ndash unless Harry and Meghan prefer to adopt more low-key titles for their children.ndash Will Harry and Meghan hire a nanny There have been rumours that Meghan will turn to her mother, Doria Ragland, for help initially.But it is likely they will hire a nanny eventually.Harry with his nanny, Tiggy Legge-Bourke, at the polo in  Harry has been close to all his nannies, especially Tiggy Legge-Bourke, and it is expected he and Meghan will arrange for a nanny to care for their baby while they are on official engagements.Kate and William have the help of their full-time live-in nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo.Royal nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo in unorm at Princess Charlottersquos christening Meghanrsquos close friend, Jessica Mulroney, had two nannies to help her with her twin boys and younger daughter.ndash Where will the baby be born Kate had three successful deliveries at the private Lindo Wing at St Maryrsquos Hospital in London so Meghan could follow her sister-in lawrsquos tried and tested lead.Harry was also born there in , as was William in .The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Louis outside the Lindo Wing at St Maryrsquos Hospital in Paddington But with the Sussexes moving to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor Great Park, Meghan may want to have her baby closer to home.The duchess might even decide to have her baby at home ndash as was once always the custom for royal babies ndashwith a team of top medical staff on hand and the latest birthing equipment on standby.Other options include the Mulberry Birth Centre at Frimley Park Hospital in Camberley, Surrey, which is  miles from Frogmore Cottage.Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey, where Meghan might have her baby It does not offer private care for maternity patients, but Meghan could still be attended to by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, surgeon-gynaecologist to the household, and Alan Farthing, the Queenrsquos surgeon-gynaecologist, who cared for Kate during her deliveries,she chose.It was the hospital that saved the le of the Countess of Wessex following complications during the birth of her daughter, Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor.The Earl and Countess of Wessex leaving Frimley Park Hospital with Lady Louise Sophiersquos son, Viscount Severn, was also born there in .Will the baby have dual citizenship Harry and Meghan could apply for their child to have dual US-UK citizenship.Meghan is planning to become a British citizen ndash but at present is still a US citizen.According to the American Embassy in the UK, a child born outside the US and in wedlock to a US citizen parent and a non-US citizen parent may acquire US citizenship at birththe US parent lived in America for five years ndash two of which were after the age of ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: QA: The low-down on Harry and Meghan us baby article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Whilst there needs to be a greater emphasis on catching those responsible, we just cannot let the stuff lie there, it must be cleaned up.Praising environmental health staff, Cllr McAlinden explained that while it is the responsibility of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, this advice from the HSE’s advice has caused problems.“The SDLP council group has raised this issue and have met with the Council’s director and senior officials to discuss this very issue. I was astonished to learn that new advice from the Health and Safety Executive is apparently the reason why we cannot get our roads cleaned.“The official advice is to ensure that when staff or contractors are litter picking along roads there must be a set clearance area between operatives and vehicles using the road.“In its most simple terms, we could see our main roads coned off or even closed off completely just to enable litter to be cleared.”Councillor McAlinden added: “Officers across the councils are challenging this guidance and that staff involved in the work think it’s madness.”“The health and safety of our staff and contractors are vital, but this guidance is overkill.”“It could and will see litter stacked up on roadsides and will ramp up the costs of clearing it when the issue is settled. I just hope common sense prevails and that some action can be taken in the interim.”Rail crossing at Lurgan to close all weekend Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT |

As a former pupil of St Patrick’s College in Armagh, Frankie became fully involved with its past pupil society. In his youth, he played for several local teams around Lurgan. He was a member of Clan Na Gael’s  Championship team as a -year-old, later becoming a valued member with Wolf Tones in Derrymacash. Frankie joined the family business, which had become a wholesale wines and spirit company, Terence McKeown  Sons. Indeed he spent the rest of his working le helping to grow this into a highly successful company as Managing Director. It eventually grew into Rehill McKeown, based for a while in premises in Mary St, Lurgan, then to purpose-built premises in Annesborough Industrial Estate. He expanded the business into off licenses and later purchased MrErlains bakery in Belfast. The company was sold to CC in the late ’s. Frankie was highly respected in the business world. He was deemed a gentleman who was wise and generous with his time, helping clients and staff.He was also part of the local Rotary and then Probus Club. Frankie also had a passion for golf and was a member of Lurgan Golf Club since the early ’s. His proudest accolades included becoming a Captain in the early ’s and then President in early ’s.Indeed he was involved in the club until very recently.

His favourite venture was the ownership of a horse that would be called Church Place, as in the location in Lurgan. Frankie would regularly attend Fairyhouse, the Maze and many other Irish venues. In a tribute, Frankie’s brother Donagh said: “When you know someone who has been part of your le for all of your le, you have many memories and good times to recall. “From childhood Frankie was around, and perhaps because of the age dference, could easily and often was seen as my father. Indeed, from the age of  when my father died, he most definitely indirectly inherited the role. He was always caring, sometimes a little stern, though for the best reason, to instill a little discipline in a young boy’s le, only with a word, I should quickly add.“It was his love for sport that we shared a joint passion, that began with a ‘kick around” in Silverwood. Always the competitive type, he occasionally let this young boy win. “When he and Bridie got married, the two would temporarily adopt myself and younger sister Aideen as their own, before having their own children. By then I became a useful babysitter from time to time. “Their door was always open and we were always welcome for family occasions. Boxing Day night was always a special time for wider family get togethers with the extended family.“It’s taken me a couple of days to be able to write my thoughts about Frankie’s passing. It will take me quite a few more to come to terms with it, even though I’ve known for a while that these days were coming. My family and friends will have many stories to tell, all tinged with personal sadness, though all with a common vein of how much fun he could be, how generous he was, how he truly cared for all, not just us, his own family.“A few years ago, I had the chance to make a short video for Frankie’s th birthday. I had a chance to make a few jokes, tell a few stories of his success in business and sport, and tell of his love of sport. Best of all though was to express something that I don’t think I really did over the previous  odd years I had known him. I said “Frankie,I never told you before, I’ll tell you now. I love you”Mr McKeown passed away peacefully at his home at Kiln Lane, Silverwood, Lurgan on February , .he was the beloved husband of Bridie and loving father of Mary , Anne , and Mel, father-in-law to Kevin, Eamonn and Geraldine, a cherished grandfather of Bronagh, Niamh, Fergal, Kate, Orla, and Grainne, dear brother of Maire, Patricia, Terence , Michael, Gerald, Diarmuid, Donagh, Aideen and the late Jim and Jackie.

But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
