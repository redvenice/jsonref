called for a new ‘war powers’ law to give parliament more scrutiny before military action is taken, after the UK joined the US and France in Syrian airstrikes.The Labour leader has questioned the legality of the bombings, saying he did not accept the strikes were justified on humanitarian grounds.Missile strikes were launched in the early hours of Saturday morning on suspected chemical weapons sites believed to be run by the Assad regime.Some 75 people, including children, are said to have died when chlorine gas and another nerve agent was used in a chemical attack in Douma, Syria, on April 7.‘I think what we need in this country is something more robust like a War Powers Act so that governments do get held to account by parliament for what they do in our name,’ Corbyn told Andrew Marr.The Labour leader warned of an escalation in a ‘proxy war’ between the US and Russia.He said chlorine has been used by ‘a number of parties in the conflict’ in Syria as a weapon.If Britain wants to ‘get the moral high ground around the world’, Corbyn said, it must abide by international law for taking military action.‘Where is the legal basis for this?’ he asked.‘I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it.A Syrian firefighter is seen inside the destroyed Scientific Research Centre in Damascus, Syria, on April 14, 2018 (Picture: Reuters)‘If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire.‘That surely would save a lot of lives.’Theresa May has faced low public support for bombing Syria without Parliament’s backing.The first poll carried out after the airstrikes showed that the public believe May’s action was wrong by a majority of almost two to one.The PM will go before the Commons tomorrow to explain why she ordered British cruise missile attacks on Syria as part of a joint operation with the United States and France."},{"url":"http://metro.co.uk/author/jenna-farmer/\" class=\"author url fn\" rel=\"author\"\u003eJenna

keep talking about what life is like with Irritable Bowel Syndrome.IBS is common – it’s thought one in five of us could suffer with it at some point during our lifetime.But because of its growing prominence, it can sometimes mean patients are labelled with the condition before being properly tested for other conditions instead.Because it’s incredibly important to be in the know, this IBS Awareness month, let’s take a moment to consider what else could be up with your gut.IBD is rarer than IBS (and a serious disease that often requires long-term medication).While IBD often involves bleeding and weight-loss, it also shares some symptoms with IBS, such as diarrhoea and stomach pain, so it’s not uncommon for those with IBD to be misdiagnosed as IBS for years beforehand.The only true way to eliminate IBD is by a colonoscopy so talk to your GP and visit Crohn’s and Colitis UK for more information.Problems with lactose are becoming more common, whether it’s temporary after a bout of food poisoning or long-term.Lactose intolerance, which manifests itself as bloating and diarrhoea, is probably best identified by keeping a detailed food diary but your GP may offer a hydrogen breath test too.Meaning there are many people with the condition clueless that they’re symptoms, such as anaemia, bloating, constipation, skin rashes, diarrhoea and mouth ulcers to name but a few, are because of coeliac disease.Coeliac disease is diagnosed via blood test and an endoscopy, but it’s crucial to keep eating gluten until you are diagnosed with the condition.SIBO stands for Small Intestinal Bowel Overgrowth.SIBO happens when there is excessive bacteria in our small intestines and patients can suffer from nutritional deficiencies, weight loss and chronic diarrhoea as a result.Common symptoms of bowel cancer, as well as tummy pain, are bleeding from the bottom or blood in your poo, unexplained weight loss, extreme tiredness for no obvious reason and a change in bowel habits lasting three weeks or more.Bowel Cancer is extremely treatable when diagnosed early but because many people put their symptoms down to other conditions, diagnosis is delayed.Keep informed via Bowel Cancer UK and chat to your doctor if something doesn’t feel right.No, IBS is NOT in your head.But people suffering from stress can mistake their body’s natural reaction to worry and anxiety as IBS.These symptoms can resolve when the stressful period is over – so don’t underestimate the power of our mind.One symptom of endometriosis is often strong abdominal pain and, because of this, it’s often misdiagnosed as IBS.If you also experience bladder difficulties and pain during sex, it could be endometriosis.Visit Endometriosis UK for guidance and support.This painful condition is more common in elderly folks, occurring when small pockets develop in the intestine’s lining.What’s worrying about erticulitis is that many people don’t experience any symptoms.But those who do experience severe pain, nausea and high temperatures.Consult your GP if you are concerned about any of the above.Jenna Farmer has Crohn’s Disease and writes about gut health over at A Balanced Belly.MORE: ‘It’s

San Francisco does have a 420 code, but it refers to ‘juvenile disturbance’, a tenuous connection at best. The California penal code does have a 420 section, but it refers to the unlawful prevention or obstruction of a person from entering public land.As for the births and deaths of musical luminaries: Bob Marley died on May 11 Joplin died in October Morrison in July Hendrix in September. Even the chemical composition for cannabis is out, coming in at 483 known compounds.          There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/17/4B1D5D9200000578-0-image-a-15_1523636424387.jpg","title":"Adorable polar bear cub goes swim walk outdoors born Germany","story":"    This is the adorable moment a polar bear cub goes for her first wander outdoors with her mother and takes a leisurely swim          Little Nanook made her first steps outside today beside her 13-year-old mother, Lara, as they travelled out of their cave for the first time since the tot was born          The polar bear cub was seen inspecting her enclosure and discovering new wonders as she enjoyed her first outing  Nanook was born on December 4 last year at the zoo (pictured) in Gelsenkirchen, western Germany, alongside two siblings who died within two days          The 18-week-old bear now weighs around 22 kilograms and fans across the nation came to see the little one in her enclosure.

A blog on the site points out the differences between ‘sugar and prostitution’, claiming that sugar daddies and babies have an ongoing relationship, and not just a financial transaction.It also claims that women on the site are not sexually abused as in prostitution and that sex is an aspiration, not a requirement. Yet evidence from women who spoke to the MoS tells a very different story. They claim that they were treated like prostitutes after signing up.A young single mother joined SA while she was a student at a Scottish university. She wanted extra money to cover her university costs while also supporting her four-year-old daughter. What turned out to be her only dates arranged through the website were with a 56-year-old man.At their first meeting, he paid for dinner and took her to the upmarket women’s clothing shop he owned, allowing her to take home any of the expensive dresses that caught her eye. But on the second date, the mood changed after he made clear to her that on the third date he expected sex. When she declined, he became enraged and began to reel off the explicit sexual services other women he had dated through Seeking Arrangement had provided him.She said: ‘I remember a particular phrase he used. He said, “This Asian girl bent over.” I remember feeling so shocked with the realisation that he expected sex. I thought, “Oh my God, this is completely screwed up.” So I just dropped him, deleted my profile from the site and got out.#IBelieveHer protesters claim victory as Irish and Ulster...Share this article‘I was naive and I did think it was a free lunch. I thought maybe you had to be seen with these men or they wanted a date for an event, a high-class escort type thing. I had no idea it was prostitution.’ The rise of university tuition fees has been beneficial for SA’s recruitment and the company aggressively markets itself to students, claiming in 2016 that more than 250,000 UK students had registered as sugar babies.Undaunted by such adverse publicity, this weekend the company is proudly hosting its latest Sugar Baby Summit in New York. In adverts for the event it says that sugar daddies, sugar babies and psychologists will all be in attendance to advise young women who attend on ‘how to bag a millionaire’.          This Cambridge PhD student said she was funding her life at university through Seeking ArrangementsShe said during the meal he plied her with copious amounts of wine, before inviting her back to his penthouse apartment where he then encouraged her to take cocaine and smoke marijuana with him.From here he cajoled her to go out on to his balcony where he forced her into a sex act with a beer bottle.On another occasion she was inundated with messages from a 70-year-old man in Brighton who offered to pay her £1,000 to have unprotected sex.The woman said she did not report the sexual assault to the police for fear of her family or friends finding out that she had sex for money.She has now left the site, but revealed the experience had left her feeling ashamed and deeply emotionally scarred. She said: ‘If a woman still thinks there is possibility of “normal dating” after signing up, she will soon understand that Seeking Arrangement and sites like it are platforms for prostitution.‘Every single interaction with men was quickly – usually after a few lines – very explicit on what they want and the price.‘All of them really quickly want nude pictures.

I’m generally asleep by nine, as there’s nothing to do. Nothing to dull the loss of a parent or child. Nothing to hold.          Liz Jones says now she\u0027s sober there’s nothing to look forward to at the end of the day. No point sitting on a terrace with a beautiful view as, with no stem in your hand, all that’s left to do is fiddle with your phoneAnd dates with men! Dear God, without booze, no sane woman would ever be reeled in. I only managed to crawl down the aisle as my maid of honour and I had quaffed a magnum in my suite beforehand.And here’s the proof of the pudding (I’m eating a lot more puddings): I went on my first date without alcohol a couple of weeks ago. A man I’d once fancied more than any other in the world seen without wine goggles became boring, old and cantankerous.Drink makes us tolerant, which is why all those young women in short skirts staggering outside bars in Newcastle don’t feel the cold, or the despair of having no future (I’m not advocating becoming paralytic, just mellow).I suppose without it we make better choices – an excuse of a ‘very hungry cat’ so we can ask for the bill and go home alone – but shouldn’t the most important lifestyle choice be to be able to relax, enjoy a full stop at the end of a gruelling week? I wonder how people face the horror that is life without liquor: the rudeness of the French in St Tropez, say, or an unopened brown envelope on the mat.I have a couple of sanctimonious ‘friends’ who don’t drink, or drink very little. Even though they smoke, rarely exercise, snort coke, eat ready meals and supermarket sliced bread, still they would raise their brows as I recycled the Christmas empties. ‘Hmm, six bottles from, what, four days?’ ‘The dog knocked a glass over.’ ‘How on earth do you afford it?’ ‘I never had children.’Can you imagine: nine months of growing varicose veins and stretch marks and the prospect of no sleep for 25 years, unable to even sip something bubbly with your feet up. I wonder anyone gets born at all. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/15/4B1DA3E600000578-0-image-m-54_1523717641242.jpg","title":"Ryanair boss Michael OLeary shouts passengers free bar Grand National win","story":"Ryanair boss Michael O\u0027Leary shouted everyone on his flight back from Aintree on Saturday drinks to rejoice in his good fortuneBut as always with the no-frills airline that charges you £13 if you forget to print out your boarding pass, they had to read the fine print.Despite the airline mogul, worth £772 million, declaring an open bar, passengers only got one round of drinks each.Enjoying a victory sip?

Mrs May will face MPs tomorrow. Asked if there were any circumstances in which he would back air strikes in Syria, Mr Corbyn replied: \u0027I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it.\u0027If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. \u0027That surely would save a lot of lives,\u0027 he told the Andrew Marr Show.  Some 75 people, including children, are said to have died when the Syrian regime used chlorine gas and another nerve agent in Douma last Saturday.Aid workers told how chlorine could be smelled in the air and victims were found with foam in their mouth and with burning eyes.Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter\u0027s Square that he is `\u0027deeply disturbed\u0027 by the international community\u0027s failure to come up with a common response to the crisis in Syria and other parts of the world.\u0027Despite the tools available to the international community, it is difficult to agree on a common action toward peace in Syria or other regions of the world,\u0027 the Pope told a crowd of 30,000 after his traditional Sunday blessing. Barzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack.

Gen. Kenneth McKenzie gave a detailed break-down of the 105 missiles launched, saying: \u0027This is going to set the program back for years. We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.\u0027He also rejected the Syrian media\u0027s claim that Assad\u0027s missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over. Russia also claimed missiles had been intercepted. The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Center which was considered to be the \u0027heart\u0027 of the regime\u0027s chemical weapons program. The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by  22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles.  The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities.  On Saturday, the General said that if any deaths are reported they may well have been the result of Assad\u0027s counter fire. \u0027Syria shot 40 large missiles into the air using ballistic trajectory, without guidance. When we shoot iron into the air without guidance, it\u0027s going to come down somewhere,\u0027 he said. Authorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipWoman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canalParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Russia: Trace of Western-made nerve agent seen in UK samples\u0027We have to take every possible precaution\u0027: Boris on RussiaCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in Blackpool    Speaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show today, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the strikes were merely aimed at deterring the use of chemical weapons Woman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canalParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Russia: Trace of Western-made nerve agent seen in UK samples\u0027We have to take every possible precaution\u0027: Boris on RussiaCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in Blackpool    A Syrian soldier films the damage at the site of the Barzah Scientific Research Center in Damascus on Saturday morning after it was annihilated by 76 missiles          Smoke was still billowing from the site on Saturday morning, hours after the 4am air and sea missile attack           Soldiers were putting out the flames and smoke on Saturday morning as US officials celebrated the attack and said \u0027mission accomplished\u0027 Woman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canalParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Russia: Trace of Western-made nerve agent seen in UK samples\u0027We have to take every possible precaution\u0027: Boris on RussiaCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in BlackpoolAll of the US aircraft returned safely to base after the attack.

The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, \u0027Before we took action, the United States communicated with\u0027 Russia to \u0027reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.\u0027A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown.

Bush addressed sailors aboard a Navy ship in May 2003 alongside a \u0027Mission Accomplished\u0027 banner, just weeks before it became apparent that Iraqis had organized an insurgency that tied down U.S. forces for years. Russia proposed a motion at the Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the airstrikes, but this was rejected with only Russia, China and Bolivia voting in favour.   Woman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canalParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Russia: Trace of Western-made nerve agent seen in UK samples\u0027We have to take every possible precaution\u0027: Boris on RussiaCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in Blackpool    Trump hailed a \u0027perfectly executed strike\u0027 just hours after launching a series of attacks on Syria.

It was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missilesBarzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack. A total of 76 missiles pummeled this site alone.

Today on the Andrew Marr show (pictured) he called for a \u0027war powers\u0027 lawThe Pentagon shared details early on Saturday of the successful, coordinated missile attack on Damascus which set the Syrian regime\u0027s chemical weapons program back \u0027years\u0027. At a press conference in Washington DC on Saturday morning, Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie gave a detailed break-down of the 105 missiles launched, saying: \u0027This is going to set the program back for years. We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.\u0027He also rejected the Syrian media\u0027s claim that Assad\u0027s missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over. Russia also claimed missiles had been intercepted. The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Center which was considered to be the \u0027heart\u0027 of the regime\u0027s chemical weapons program. The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by  22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles.  The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities.  On Saturday, the General said that if any deaths are reported they may well have been the result of Assad\u0027s counter fire. \u0027Syria shot 40 large missiles into the air using ballistic trajectory, without guidance. When we shoot iron into the air without guidance, it\u0027s going to come down somewhere,\u0027 he said. All of the US aircraft returned safely to base after the attack. Gen. McKenzie did not say where the Lancer B-1 Bombers had flown from but other officials suggested they were deployed from an airbase in Qatar.       A Syrian soldier films the damage at the site of the Barzah Scientific Research Center in Damascus on Saturday morning after it was annihilated by 76 missiles            Smoke was still billowing from the site on Saturday morning, hours after the 4am air and sea missile attack             Soldiers were putting out the flames and smoke on Saturday morning as US officials celebrated the attack and said \u0027mission accomplished\u0027 \u0027We met our objective. We hit our target. It was mission accomplished,\u0027 a Pentagon spokesperson said on Saturday, repeating President Trump\u0027s tweet earlier in the day.Hours after Trump hailed the missile strike targeting the Syria\u0027s suspected chemical weapons - tweeting, \u0027Mission Accomplished!\u0027 - Vice President Mike Pence defended the president while building support among U.S. allies for the joint strikes with Britain and France on Saturday.\u0027The objective of the mission the commander in chief gave our military forces and our allies was completely accomplished - with swift professionalism,\u0027 Pence told reporters, noting there were \u0027no reported civilian casualties.\u0027He also had a warning for Russia: \u0027Our message to Russia is, \u0027you\u0027re on the wrong side of history,\u0027 \u0027 Pence also said. \u0027It\u0027s time for Russia to get the message President Trump delivered last night. \u0027You\u0027re known by the company you keep.\u0027Russia has military forces, including air defences, in several areas of Syria to support President Assad in his long war against anti-government rebels.Confusion arose over the extent to which Washington warned Moscow in advance. The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, \u0027Before we took action, the United States communicated with\u0027 Russia to \u0027reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.\u0027A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown.

Fifty-seven of those were Tomahawk missiles and 19 were Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles.The Tomahawks were mostly fired from the USS Monterey, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser and the USS Higgins, USS Laboon and the USS John Warner submarine. France deployed its Mirage and Dassault Rafale jets and reportedly used four frigate warships. It is not clear how many aircraft were deployed. Britain is believed only to have fired missiles from its Torpedoes and Typhoon aircraft. Other ships from each nation\u0027s military were in the region, including the USS Donald Cook, but did not fire any weapons. Despite the attack, Pentagon spokesperson Dana White said the US was still committed to a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the ongoing civil war in Syria.\u0027Our goal has not changed. Our goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS....but Assad\u0027s actions were beyond the pale.

Bush addressed sailors aboard a Navy ship in May 2003 alongside a \u0027Mission Accomplished\u0027 banner, just weeks before it became apparent that Iraqis had organized an insurgency that tied down U.S. forces for years. Russia proposed a motion at the Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the airstrikes, but this was rejected with only Russia, China and Bolivia voting in favour.   Woman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canalParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Russia: Trace of Western-made nerve agent seen in UK samples\u0027We have to take every possible precaution\u0027: Boris on RussiaCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in Blackpool      Trump hailed a \u0027perfectly executed strike\u0027 just hours after launching a series of attacks on Syria.

Jeremy Corbyn insisted he would never countenance military action without a UN resolution - even though Russia has the power to veto themSpeaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show, Mr Corbyn said: \u0027I think what we need in this country is something more robust like a War Powers Act so that governments do get held to account by Parliament for what they do in our name.\u0027 The Labour leader warned of an escalation in a \u0027proxy war\u0027 between the US and Russia. He said chlorine has been used by \u0027a number of parties in the conflict\u0027 in Syria as a weapon. Mr Corbyn said that if Britain wants to \u0027get the moral high ground around the world\u0027 it must abide by international law for taking military action. He said the humanitarian grounds used by the UK to justify strikes was \u0027debatable\u0027.               The Labour leader also made clear he does not accept that the strikes on Syria by the UK, US and France were legally justified on humanitarian grounds\u0027Where is the legal basis for this?\u0027 he said.  Asked if there were any circumstances in which he would back air strikes in Syria, Mr Corbyn replied: \u0027I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it. \u0027If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. That surely would save a lot of lives.\u0027  Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said taking military action against the Assad regime had been the \u0027wrong thing to do\u0027.She told ITV\u0027s Peston On Sunday: \u0027We think that it should be in law that there should be a vote in Parliament before we take military action.   \u0027NATO killers go home\u0027: Communist protest

But I do think we need to look at options for gaining an assurance that if there is to be any further action that changes the terms of engagement of UK forces in Syria, that that is sanctioned by a vote in Parliament.‘So the SNP, in consultation if there is a willingness to do so with other parties, will be looking at the options that are open to us.’A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday today found that 36 per cent of the public favoured airstrikes against Assad over the atrocity in Douma, while 40 per cent were against.Nearly six out of ten believe there should be no more missile strikes unless Mrs May wins the backing of MPs. Only one in five were in favour of the PM using her executive powers to launch more raids.In better news for Mrs May, her personal ratings have surged and she now leads Mr Corbyn by a net 13 points. Research for Survation found a previous seven-point lead for Labour had evaporated since the Salisbury attack and the parties are now neck and neck.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson delivered an impassioned defence of the military action today saying failure to respond to Assad\u0027s use of illegal chemical weapons would have undermined \u0027civilised values\u0027.    Jeremy Corbyn insisted he would never countenance military action without a UN resolution - even though Russia has the power to veto them          Speaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show today, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the strikes were merely aimed at deterring the use of chemical weapons But amid fears of revenge attacks by Russia, Mr Johnson stressed there was no intention of getting more deeply involved in the Syrian civil war.Concerns have been raised that a cyber backlash could see vital services including water supplies, gas networks, banks, hospitals and air traffic control affected. There is also speculation they could try to spread embarrassing \u0027Kompromat\u0027 material about senior politicians.Speaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show, Mr Johnson said: \u0027You have to take every possible precaution, and when you look at what Russia has done, not just in this country, in Salisbury, attacks on TV stations, on the democratic processes, on critical national infrastructure – of course we have to be very, very cautious indeed.\u0027Mr Johnson also refused to confirm that there will be a retrospective vote on the military action. Ministers are likely to come under pressure to publish the government\u0027s full legal opinion on the basis for strikes, after issuing a summary yesterday.           GCHQ is thought to be monitoring the web to pick up any signs of cyber aggression from the Kremlin, following the unified missile strikes on Syrian chemical basis in DamascusThere is not thought to be any mechanism for Opposition parties to force a Commons ision this week, so it is up to the government whether to hold one.Some 75 people, including children, are said to have died when the Syrian regime used chlorine gas and another nerve agent in Douma last Saturday.After ordering military action for the first time since entering No 10, a grim-faced Mrs May used a 9am Downing Street press conference to insist \u0027limited and targeted\u0027 bombing was the \u0027right thing to do\u0027 to stop the use of banned chemical weapons.The military action passed off without UK casualties or any of the Russian forces on the ground being hit. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/15/14/4B2A7AD900000578-0-image-m-32_1523797780826.jpg","title":"Leah Washington boyfriend Joe Pugh spotted walking hand hand enjoy night out","story":"Add some lace like Leah in PrettyLittleThingShop it here!Leah Washington went for a glam getup on a date night with her boyfriend this weekend.

Again, we are being threatened. We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences.

The astonishing images show what appears to be the main buildings reduced to rubbleSpeaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show today, Mr Johnson said: \u0027You have to take every possible precaution, and when you look at what Russia has done, not just in this country, in Salisbury, attacks on TV stations, on the democratic processes, on critical national infrastructure – of course we have to be very, very cautious indeed.\u0027 Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the UK\u0027s air strikes \u0027legally questionable\u0027, forcing the Government to publish detailed legal advice justifying the bombings. Today Mr Corbyn demanded a \u0027war powers\u0027 law to ban the Prime Minister from taking military action without a Commons vote.The official legal advice claimed \u0027the UK is permitted under international law, on an exceptional basis, to take measures in order to alleviate overwhelming humanitarian suffering\u0027. Mrs May will face MPs tomorrow. Asked if there were any circumstances in which he would back air strikes in Syria, Mr Corbyn replied: \u0027I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it.\u0027If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. \u0027That surely would save a lot of lives,\u0027 he told the Andrew Marr Show.  The second site outside of Homs was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons  Bunker. It was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missilesSome 75 people, including children, are said to have died when the Syrian regime used chlorine gas and another nerve agent in Douma last Saturday.Aid workers told how chlorine could be smelled in the air and victims were found with foam in their mouth and with burning eyes.Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter\u0027s Square that he is `\u0027deeply disturbed\u0027 by the international community\u0027s failure to come up with a common response to the crisis in Syria and other parts of the world.\u0027Despite the tools available to the international community, it is difficult to agree on a common action toward peace in Syria or other regions of the world,\u0027 the Pope told a crowd of 30,000 after his traditional Sunday blessing. Barzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack. A total of 76 missiles pummeled this site alone.

Gen. Kenneth McKenzie gave a detailed break-down of the 105 missiles launched, saying: \u0027This is going to set the program back for years. We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.\u0027He also rejected the Syrian media\u0027s claim that Assad\u0027s missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over. Russia also claimed missiles had been intercepted. The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Center which was considered to be the \u0027heart\u0027 of the regime\u0027s chemical weapons program. The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by  22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles.  The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities.  On Saturday, the General said that if any deaths are reported they may well have been the result of Assad\u0027s counter fire. \u0027Syria shot 40 large missiles into the air using ballistic trajectory, without guidance. When we shoot iron into the air without guidance, it\u0027s going to come down somewhere,\u0027 he said. Woman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canalParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Russia: Trace of Western-made nerve agent seen in UK samples\u0027We have to take every possible precaution\u0027: Boris on RussiaCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in Blackpool    Speaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show today, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the strikes were merely aimed at deterring the use of chemical weapons Woman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canalParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Russia: Trace of Western-made nerve agent seen in UK samples\u0027We have to take every possible precaution\u0027: Boris on RussiaCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in Blackpool    A Syrian soldier films the damage at the site of the Barzah Scientific Research Center in Damascus on Saturday morning after it was annihilated by 76 missiles          Smoke was still billowing from the site on Saturday morning, hours after the 4am air and sea missile attack           Soldiers were putting out the flames and smoke on Saturday morning as US officials celebrated the attack and said \u0027mission accomplished\u0027 Woman to testify at her own murder trial in groundbreaking caseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipScottish marathon runner lies helpless on concrete after collapsingShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyPolice search for missing teenager Charlie Pope in Manchester canalParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Russia: Trace of Western-made nerve agent seen in UK samples\u0027We have to take every possible precaution\u0027: Boris on RussiaCar drives into a crowd in the town centre in BlackpoolAll of the US aircraft returned safely to base after the attack.

The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, \u0027Before we took action, the United States communicated with\u0027 Russia to \u0027reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.\u0027A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown.

The painter, who died as a French Catholic named Léonard Foujita, had been born 81 years earlier as Tsuguharu Foujita, the son of a general in Japan’s imperial army.This year, celebrations marking the anniversary of his death, organised in Paris, Reims, Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, hope to bring him back from obscurity. For Foujita was one of the most successful artists of the 1920s, worshipped by the critics and art lovers who paid a fortune for his drawings, watercolours and oil paintings. As Paris’s shining art star, he was more successful than Picasso and more acclaimed than Matisse. Now he is the subject of a major exhibition at the Maillol Museum which focuses on the artist’s most prolific period, between 1913 and 1931.Brought up in a family open to western culture, Foujita was given French lessons from an early age. After studying western art at Tokyo’s fine arts school, he completed his training with a trip to Paris. Arriving on 6 August 1913, he knew immediately that he wouldn’t be returning home any time soon. That day, the Chilean painter Manuel Ortiz de Zárate, intrigued by Foujita’s distinctive and elegant look, introduced himself and the two became friends.The following day, Zárate took him to Picasso’s studio. There, in front of Picasso’s paintings and his collection of Le Douanier, Henri Rousseau, Foujita felt electrified.Too old to enrol in a second graduate course at the Beaux-Arts, he signed up as a copyist at the Louvre. Transfixed by antiquities and their stylised beauty, Foujita quickly realised he needed to adapt his vision, either in opposition to, or in conciliation with, western art. He chose hybridisation, a path that no other Japanese artist had dared take before. His unique style immediately fascinated both public and critics.His first solo exhibition, in June 1917 at Gallery Chéron, near the Champs-Élysées, was a triumph. His 110 watercolours sold out instantly.Picasso, who was among the first visitors and stayed for hours, left with as many canvases as he could afford and carry. To meet the high demand, Chéron, his dealer, who was also representing Modigliani and Soutine, asked him to produce two watercolours a day.Foujita had two secrets. The first one was called Fernande Barrey, a 24-year-old prostitute-turned-model who posed for Modigliani. He married her 13 days after meeting her at Café de la Rotonde on Boulevard du Montparnasse. The second was a thin brush, black and white paints, and a white glaze, the recipe for which he kept secret for years.Made of mixed flaxseed oil, crushed chalk or white lead, and magnesium silicate, it was unheard of in the west and gave his paintings a hypnotic, milky iridescence that fascinated viewers. His work stood in marked contrast to that of Matisse and Braque, who used large brushes and bright colours.Above all things, Foujita loved painting cats and naked women. Kiki de Montparnasse posed for him, and so did a new love, Lucie, barely 20 whom he also met at La Rotonde. Her skin was so white that he nicknamed her Youki – snow in Japanese.By the 1920s, Foujita was being exhibited and sold worldwide. Extravagance ruled. At Youki’s birthday, the artist gave her a convertible car with a radiator cap made of a small bronze by Rodin. Hugely successful, he spent all his money.Foujita found his look early: a short bowl haircut and small round glasses. He added to his celebrity status by drawing and making costumes that landed him in gossip columns and fashion magazines. He photographed and filmed himself as he worked. A great painter, he was also, unconsciously perhaps, building a brand. Increasingly, the artist became overshadowed by the dandy. In self-portraits, Foujita always appeared composed and inscrutable, but what did he really think of the avatar he had created?Youki had now become the mistress of his best friend, the poet Robert Desnos and France’s tax department started demanding huge sums, which the famous painter had forgotten to save. Having reached an impasse, Foujita escaped with a young model called Madeleine to South America. This is the point at which the exhibition at the Maillol Museum ends – but the story didn’t stop there, of course.From South America, he returned to Japan in 1933, becoming an official painter for the imperial army. He lent his talent to his country’s propaganda efforts throughout the second world war. However, protected by General MacArthur and rich American art collectors, he was allowed to return discreetly to Paris in 1950, accompanied by Kimiyo, his Japanese fifth wife.They settled in Montparnasse and led a quiet life. Foujita obtained French nationality in 1955 and converted to Catholicism, choosing the name of Léonard, as a tribute to Da Vinci. Forgiven and restored to the west, Foujita was finally buried in Reims, like a French king.Foujita, Painting in the Roaring 20s, is at the Maillol Museum, Paris, until 15 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c02746dbd9a44a09092c470944c4ee0476d3f7f0/0_272_6557_3935/master/6557.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e54ad4a2cb0d91f78ba9f1ad3824a510 2600w","title":"shed the size of town what britains giant distribution centres tell us about modern life","story":"When you click on a product, something, somewhere, moves. The item is shifted off its shelf by human or robot and on to a chain of delivery mechanisms that takes it to your door. That item, and millions others like it, plus the machinery that handles them, needs space. The more we shop online, the more such space is needed.You’ll know all this, I expect, but you may only be dimly aware of the physical consequences: very big boxes, getting bigger and more numerous. Higher, too, as robotic distribution systems allow goods to be piled further from the ground than before.These boxes are of such importance that some are classed as “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, which means that national government rather than local authorities give them planning permission. Some are shrouded in secrecy. They are where the virtual becomes physical, with a vengeance. Their scale challenges the conventions of town and country planning, pushing their designers and creators to find more or less convincing ways to respond.Imagine the space that is used to store and display a product in a traditional shop, and then imagine great dollops of it sucked from almost every high street and supermarket in the land to a centralised facility. Add it to the long-established need for physical shops to warehouse their goods.

They are called distribution centres, which differ from what used to be called warehouses in the degree to which the buildings are integrated into logistical networks of trucks, trains, the internet and subsidiary distribution points.The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas argues that the modern countryside is now ided into two types: on the one hand industrialised agriculture with the big structures that serve it, on the other landscapes preserved for their picturesque beauty. Dirft confirms his point. It stands close to the pretty Northamptonshire village of Crick, with its medieval church of St Margaret’s (Grade I listed, notable Romanesque font), also to the pleasant rolling countryside of Warwickshire (Shakespeare’s county, as the sign on the border says). Dirft itself consists of colossal distribution centres from which retailers dispatch their produce, via the nearby M1, across the country. Here is an abstracted high street of the nation in which the buyable contents of a home – food, furnishings, hardware, clothes – are translated into vast labelled containers: Tesco, Sainsburys, Bathstore, Halfords.The Dirft development’s origins lie in the mid-90s, when a freight rail connection was established, via Felixstowe docks and the then new Channel tunnel, into something called the Trans-European Transport Network. As the area had already been designated, in 1978, as a “motorway orientated growth point” the addition of the railport made it exceptionally fertile ground for the bumper crops of big sheds that then started to blossom there. There are now more than 6m sq ft of building with another 7.7m on the way.Dirft is no prettier than its name and doesn’t claim to be so. It is a landscape of those mute boxes and of the roads, loading areas and parking zones they need to sustain them, the earth vigorously reshaped to make the flat platforms on which they stand. It is made of fences, berms and security gates, of young trees in their protective tubes and gnarled old ones, survivors of the site’s former rural life. A pitched-roofed Ibis hotel adds a note of forlorn domesticity. Wind turbines turn.You couldn’t call it country or town: it is a node, a zone. It approaches a sort of sublime, you could say, in which the vast whiteish rectangles resemble conceptual art and the engineered terrain unwittingly becomes land art. Its scale is that of the national and international networks of which it is part, not the locality.The complex is surprisingly uncontentious, given its size and impact, among the local community. “It is positive”, says Josie Flavell of Crick parish council “in that a number of residents are employed by the many companies at Dirft.” She is pleased that Prologis, the company that owns the site, contributes towards two police community support officers, organises litter removal, pays for cycling and pedestrian routes and financed a heritage board to be placed at the site of the old Kilsby and Crick railway.Simon Bowers, of Daventry district council, also likes the jobs it brings. “It’s a valued part of the local economy,” he says. “It’s an appropriate development that does no real harm.”But, in a country where land is as constrained as in Britain, where it is a struggle to find space for other such essentials as new housing, the growth of big sheds is particularly hard to accommodate. If it is a fast-moving business, wherein a building 10 times the volume of St Paul’s Cathedral might go up in six months, it might take a decade to assemble a site out of former farmland, and win planning permission for it. In Lutterworth there is a campaign group called Magna Park Is Big Enough, which in January persuaded the local council to refuse, by a margin of two votes, a planned expansion. One meeting of the group was held in a hangar to accommodate the number of protesters.There is, therefore, a motivation to “innovate in a mindful and respectful way”, as Gazeley, owner of the Magna Parks, put it. Last year Creative Review magazine spotted a trend, a “new breed of superstructures trying very hard to disappear”. Off the M5, for example, near Bridgwater in Somerset, a huge Morrisons distribution centre is clad in long horizontal strips of varying shades of green, the better to blend with the lush West Country landscape. Magna Park in Milton Keynes, home to John Lewis, Waitrose and River Island, a mile-plus-long, 4m sq ft array, is uniformly banded with gradations of blue, from dark at the bottom to pale at the top. The intention is that it will fade into the sky.It depends on the location, explains Tim Ward of Chetwoods, the architects of the Milton Keynes Magna Park and a number of other distribution centres. If the structures are generally viewed with landscape behind, green works well if sky, blue is better. There is, he says, some art to the choice of tones that includes a knowledge of the latest developments in the technology of colour.Chetwoods are keen to stress that they don’t want the structures to disappear, exactly – a futile task, given the enormous size of the buildings – but rather to be less intrusive. Indeed, you are conscious of Magna Park Milton Keynes from miles around – an insistent, astounding, blueish presence that occupies the horizon from end to end, an alternative atmospheric that keeps reappearing down country lanes, from new housing estates and across fields. Or, if you are driving along the M1, it is an azure-cerulean abstraction, flipping past the edge of vision for an appreciable interval of time.The striking thing about it is less the breaking-up of its bulk than the consistency of the pattern across such an expanse of surface. There may never before have been so much synthetic blueness in one place.Colour, in any case, only gets you so far. Gazeley like to talk of the million trees they have planted at Lutterworth to create a publicly accessible “Magna Wood” and “the wildlife-rich Mere Lane Lagoon fishing lake.” At Milton Keynes a pond captures and attenuates the rainwater that falls on the development’s expanses of roof. There are swans, moorhens and many species of tree. There is a “bee hotel”. There is an uplifting, if artistically dubious, statue of the Olympic long jumper Greg Rutherford on the roundabout at the entrance to the complex. As befits the home of Waitrose, Magna Park has a palpable quality and coherence in its layout, but even blunt Dirft has measures to buffer its impact with landscape.Gazeley are particularly proud of Altitude, a new distribution centre on their Milton Keynes site that is not only an unusually high 21 metres but also has a roof ready to be covered by photovoltaic cells, at such time as they become economically viable. The health and wellbeing of employees will be supported by such things as good lighting and ventilation and reindeer moss growing on living walls inside the building. New technology is reducing the number of jobs in the business, I’m told, but many of those that remain are becoming more skilled, which means that companies have to try harder to attract good\u0026nbspstaff.Laurie Chetwood of Chetwoods says that distribution centres, which are among the most single-minded of building types, must now acquire a “duality of purpose”, which means things such as making running tracks out of the fire engine lanes that surround the boxes. He talks of cladding that can double as batteries to store solar energy gathered on the roof. One day, maybe, it might be possible to charge electric trucks with it, which would mitigate the rather obvious ecological drawbacks of dispatching thousands of HGVs across the country every day.Simple as they may look, distribution centres are sophisticated structures. The machinery that moves stuff around is constantly evolving. Their playing field-sized floors have to be exceptionally level, as small unevenness could cause the high fork-lift trucks they use to lean unacceptably at the top. Years of competition have made their structure as spare and economical as can be. Architects such as Chetwoods have to reconcile all this with the wishes of users (who might want something tailored to their needs) and of investors, who will want a structure to be adaptable to future users.It is tempting to say that these buildings make the internet visible, except that their visibility is strictly limited. Sometimes they get into the news when reporters, posing as warehouse workers, bring news of working conditions inside. You can get a glimmer on Google, for example from employee reviews of Primark’s warehouse, which sits like an acropolis on a raised earthwork in Northamptonshire: “they’re treating a people like nothing,” says one in imperfect English “they beautiful lied on induction how much they cares about worker, don’t believe them.” The buildings, however, remain notably blank,\u0026nbspgiving almost no clue of their busy inner lives.Some users and owners are dismissive of press inquiries to a degree unusual in big, public relations-conscious companies. Tesco refused a request to see inside their Dirft base, which was possibly not surprising, but also to answer simple questions, such as: what are its dimensions?For the writer Carolyn Steel, whose book Hungry City: How Food Shapes Our Lives examines the relationship of society to food, this secrecy is the antithesis of the more public processes by which food once progressed from field to market to kitchen to plate. “The exchange of food used to bring people together,” she says. “Now the process is designed to exclude the human”. But distribution centres manifest the world we have chosen and had chosen for us, in return for efficiency and convenience, in which a product appears in the home by ever more inscrutable magic.Their scale and growth are a consequence of the fact that all that physicality and volume\u0026nbspthat the virtual world displaces has to go somewhere. It’s welcome that architects and developers should try to make something of them and to mitigate their impact with woods, ponds and indeed coloured bands. But, short of a dramatic restructuring of the economic, technical and social basis of the modern world, these uncompromising building types will only become more essential to our lives. The contrast between\u0026nbspwhat was previously thought of as natural and urban landscape will only become\u0026nbspmore stark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/006c60975f11c5f2a7084e6330ef787cc5e0cc43/303_0_4543_2726/master/4543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7b8a1f39b0e6798bba2e78ca926494c4 1240w","title":"philip green defends his record on bhs","story":"Retail tycoon ‘sad’ that he doesn’t get more credit for paying into bankrupt chain’s pension fundRetail tycoon Sir Philip Green has defended his behaviour over the collapse of the BHS chain, describing his decision to sell the retailer to a serial bankrupt as “the worst mistake of my life”.The billionaire owner of Topshop and Miss Selfridge said he was “sad” he had not received recognition for paying £363m into the BHS pension scheme last year, in a move that headed off the threat of him losing his knighthood. Asked in an interview with the Mail on Sunday if any of the BHS furore was his fault, he said: “No. Zero. Nothing.”Green owned BHS for 15 years before selling it to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell for £1 in 2015 – a year before the retailer collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs. Green and other investors were paid £586m in idends, rent and interest during their ownership of the retailer.Referring to BHS, Green added: “We didn’t go as a vulture and bankrupt it, try to keep it all to ourselves. That was the stupidity. Trying to do it the correct way turned out to be a disaster.”Claiming that he spent £35m on the legal bill alone for dealing with the BHS collapse, he said: “My family lost millions on BHS.”Following a parliamentary investigation into the BHS collapse, the businessman was labelled by MPs the “unacceptable face of capitalism” and accused of the “systematic plunder” of the company, along with Chappell and their “hangers-on”. Under pressure from the Pensions Regulator, Green agreed to pay £363m into the BHS pension scheme in February 2017 to help plug its £571m black hole. He feels he deserves more credit for this.“I wrote a cheque for £363m,” he told the Mail on Sunday. “But nobody has ever said, this man behaved like a gentleman, his family behaved properly. I’m not doing this as an act for you because you know it’s not my style – but I’m sad that there’s no acceptance of that.”He added: “Fortunately, we were able to pay and rectify it. I was pleased we were able to resolve it.”Green questioned whether antisemitism played a role in the accusations. “Do I think the viciousness has anything to do with the fact that I am a Jewish businessman? Well, I’m not going to say. The answer is I don’t want to get into it.”He came under fire for cruising the Mediterranean in his wife Tina’s £100m yacht Lionheart in the summer after the BHS collapse while BHS pensioners worried about their future. His wife is also the legal owner of Green’s business empire (since 2004). The couple’s lavish lifestyle has frequently drawn criticism.Green defended his lifestyle, saying it was the result of his business successes. “I feel like I’ve got to justify I had the ability to pay, that my family has got a yacht, that I’m living a nice lifestyle. Thank goodness, along my journey, I was very successful and therefore I was able to pay.”Green also accused Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee that led the investigation into BHS, of a personal vendetta. The Pensions Regulator’s report showed he had made a number of earlier offers before a final deal was reached, but Green’s view is that Field “harassed the Pension Regulator” and that this delayed the payment, according to the Mail on Sunday.The collapse of BHS in April 2016 was one of Britain’s biggest business scandals and led to calls from MPs that Green should be stripped of his knighthood.Unlike Chappell, Green escaped a ban from serving as a company director by the Insolvency Service last month.

In the meantime we will have lost a lot of installers, who will have gone out of business – a lot of expertise. It’s not a shame – it’s shocking in this day and age, really.”The government axed its flagship energy efficiency scheme in 2015 and has yet to replace it or signal what might come next. Guijarro said the black hole on policy could lead people to conclude energy efficiency is unimportant, even though experts view it as vital for cutting bills and carbon emissions.“You have this whole radio silence, this missed opportunity where you could absolutely have that narrative around health and wellbeing, and benefits of having a warmer, healthier home. And the longer it goes on the more people think it’s not important,” Guijaro said.The comments by Citizens Advice follow the government coming under fire for downgrading targets for insulating older homes with solid walls. The University of Exeter said the move meant it would take more than 400 years to upgrade the UK’s last uninsulated solid wall homes.E.ON told the Guardian that the change could also restrict the help that vulnerable households received, and make the solid wall target more challenging to hit. The big-six energy supplier said a serious energy efficiency plan would help consumers more than a price cap, which it has vigorously opposed.“Overall, as a country we need to bring the energy efficiency of homes up to the level that is right for the 21st century, and which could save many hundreds of pounds off the annual energy bill. This is a far more sustainable policy, which politicians should consider embracing as opposed to implementing a temporary market-wide price cap,” the company said.A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: “We are investing £6bn into making homes more energy efficient, including schemes to provide insulation, as well as a further £320m to enable consumers and non-domestic users to participate in a trailblazing heat networks scheme.”Industry and government are mulling how to reduce the climate change impact from heating, with energy efficiency considered a “no regrets” option.The UK’s homes and businesses are overwhelmingly heated by fossil fuels, mostly gas. Energy UK, the big-six lobby group, last week urged the government to fund trials of low-CO2 alternatives, such as greener gases including hydrogen, heat pumps running off renewable electricity and local heat networks.But experts said the switch to greener heat would not be as simple as the transition to low-CO2 power, which accounted for half of UK electricity supplied last year.Mike Hemsley, senior power analyst at the government’s climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, said: “There’s a lot of barriers to installing efficiency and low-carbon heat.” He added that it was also not clear yet whether there was a low-CO2 option that was cheaper than today’s heating systems.The government’s experts seem to share that view. A report published on Friday by BEIS concluded there was a large degree of uncertainty over the best way to decarbonise heat, given limited information on the feasibility of the technologies, their cost and whether consumers would accept them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9ec96ba6d2f37a20014902059cd40681ea3a0b0/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2c0a92cc90ca9ee9a12542e7c954fa9b 1720w","title":"trinidad homphobic laws win case commonwealth","story":"I am a gay Trinidadian. Until three days ago, making that statement could have landed me in prison. Before Thursday, it was a crime for adults of the same gender to have sex. Our “buggery” law imposed 25 years’ imprisonment. All other intimacy between two women or two men risked five years’ imprisonment under the demeaningly named offence of “serious indecency”.Last year I said enough is enough and sued my country to change the law. My legal team, led by Richard Drabble QC, argued that these laws violate the right to privacy, family life, equality before the law and freedom of expression.On Thursday we won the case – and resoundingly so. Mr Justice Rampersad in the high court of Port of Spain, our capital, handed down judgment agreeing that each of these rights was violated. On a rough count, there are about 100,000 LGBTQ+ people in Trinidad and Tobago. Finally, each of us is free from the fear of arrest, prosecution and imprisonment simply for living our lives.Listening to the judgment, I broke down in tears as I realised that I had won, that my country – for the first time – had accepted me for who I am. I can’t describe how it feels to hear a judge say that as a gay man I have an inherent human dignity with which the state must not interfere. His firmness on this point was commendable – laws that criminalise homosexuality, he ruled, are as heinous as those that allowed apartheid, segregation and the Holocaust. I agree.The judge recognised that when human dignity is stripped away, so as to render one characteristic “superior” to another, society goes awry. After the judgment, as I stood outside the Hall of Justice wrapped in a rainbow flag, I had finally been clothed in dignity.This judgment was the culmination of my 30 years of human rights’ activism. I was born in the 1960s, the decade that Trinidad and Tobago gained independence from Britain. Like other former colonies, we inherited Britain’s anti-gay laws. But our Spanish, French and Dutch-speaking neighbours do not criminalise homosexuality, and never did.As a teenager, it was obvious to others that I was gay. The bullying was incessant and cruel. In the 1980s I left Trinidad for London, unable to cope with the daily homophobia. In 1992 I returned home but the persecution had not changed. In 1996 I was forced away again. I came back between 2011 and 2014 to try to progress this issue through engagement and advocacy but the homophobia remained intolerable. In the end, this saga of suffering won me my case. My having to leave – effectively forced into exile – was submitted as evidence to the court of how vile these laws are.Litigation was a last resort for me, so that I could return home. That is all I have ever wanted to do. It has been the most humbling of experiences, with challenges that I could not have imagined. The religious groups who supported the retention of the laws were polite opponents, as much as we disagreed. The shock to me was that those who should most support decriminalisation most disrupted my challenge. My only support from any NGO – in Trinidad, the UK or internationally – was some funding from an HIV-prevention charity.In December 2015 I approached the Human Dignity Trust, a London-based charity whose sole purpose is to bring about the decriminalisation of homosexuality. It said it would help. I was overjoyed, but then it dropped me without explanation, blocking my remaining routes to funding in the process. Just as upsetting was how my country’s Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) reacted to my challenge. It submitted a document to court supporting the retention of the criminal laws. At that stage, I almost gave up.I ran my case on a shoestring of around £20,000 over two-and-a-half years. That’s a mere 20p per LGBTQ+ person no longer a criminal. I now hope that my lean model becomes the norm, whereby activists are in control, unbeholden to global organisations that often only profit from our suffering.It was only the support of my legal team that kept me going – Rishi Dass and Antonio Emmanuel in Trinidad, and Peter Laverack in London, who in particular has been my rock, and was the architect of the legal arguments that won the day.At the EOC, it turned out that a junior member of staff submitted the document without authority. The day before the trial, thankfully, it was withdrawn.After the many bumps in the road, it was the rule of law that prevailed. For that, all Trinbagonians can rejoice. My dignity is their dignity is our dignity. The words of my country’s national anthem say that its citizens of every kind “find an equal place”. Now, finally, I have.With the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting taking place in London from Monday, I am hopeful that our victory offers pause to the 36 of 53 Commonwealth countries that still criminalise homosexuality. Nine are in the Caribbean.The right to dignity that Trinidad and Tobago’s court recognised in me is universal – in lesbians criminalised in Uganda and Tanzania, and in gay men criminalised in India and Singapore.It is imperative that LGBTQ+ is on the agenda in London. The event offers both a safe space for this discussion and an opportunity for the capital of the former empire that bequeathed us these heinous laws to help rid us of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/266cc48868797af0021a64acfbbd55339d86cc11/0_0_4370_2624/master/4370.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=789e682c1eebe398e931059d3df02859 1240w","title":"poor peoples campaign systemic poverty a sin","story":"After the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign declared silence was betrayal, we are coming together to stand up to the public policy violence that is ravaging our societyAccess to healthcare is just one of the issues facing the 140 million people who live in poverty in the US today. Over the past two years, the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival has carried out a listening tour in dozens of states across this nation. We have met with tens of thousands of people from El Paso, Texas, to South Charleston, West Virginia, to Selma, Alabama, where we met Callie, gathering testimonies from poor people and listening to their demands for a better society. On Tuesday, we announced a Poor People’s Campaign Moral Agenda, a set of demands that is drawn from this listening tour, as well as an  audit of America we conducted with allied organizations, including the Institute for Policy Studies and the Urban Institute, 50 years after the original Poor People’s Campaign. As grim as the situation was in 1968, the appalling truth is deep inequalities still exist and, in some ways, we are worse off. In the last eight years alone, 23 states have passed voter suppression laws – gutting the Voting Rights Act civil rights leaders helped secure more than a half century ago. This is the true hacking of our democracy, allowing people to win office who deny healthcare, living wages, cut necessary social programs and push policies that promote mass incarceration, hurt immigrants and devastate our environment.These racist laws hurt not just people of color, but poor whites whose lives are upended by the politicians put in office by the violent extremism that is voter suppression. Coretta Scott King would call all of this violence. She’d say that violence isn’t just killing people with guns, but denying them living wages, allowing them to live in ghetto housing. We rightfully get in the streets and protest when the police shoot unarmed black men, but we must also stand up to the public policy violence that is ravaging our society. We must no longer allow attention to violence to keep the poor, people of color and other disenfranchised people down.People are poor not because they are lazy, not because they are unwilling to work hard, but because politicians have blocked living wages and healthcare and undermined union rights and wage increases. Our nation’s moral narrative is shaped by Christian nationalists whose claims run contrary to calls in the Scripture, which is very clear that we need to care for the poor, immigrants and the least among us.  If you claim to be evangelical and Christian and have nothing to say about poverty and racism, then your claim is terribly suspect. There needs to be a new moral discourse in this nation – one that says being poor is not a sin but systemic poverty is. The Moral Agenda we announced on Tuesday demands a massive overhaul of the nation’s voting rights laws, new programs to lift up the 140 million Americans living in poverty, immediate attention to ecological devastation and measures to curb militarism and the war economy. We call for major changes to address systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and our distorted moral narrative, including restoration and expansion of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, repeal of the 2017 federal tax law, implementation of federal and state living wage laws, universal single-payer healthcare and clean water for all.  To make sure these demands are heard, poor and disenfranchised people from coast to coast are preparing for 40 days of action centered around statehouses and the US Capitol. Over six weeks this spring, people of all races, colors and creeds are joining together to engage in nonviolent moral fusion direct action, massive voter mobilization and power building from the bottom up.  To prepare for the 40 days, poor and disenfranchised people, clergy and advocates will participate in nonviolent direct-action trainings across the country on Saturday. Now, 50 years after leaders of the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign declared silence was betrayal, we are coming together to break the silence and tell the truth about the interlocking evils of systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and our distorted moral narrative. All over the country, poor people like Callie are joining together, with support from clergy and advocates. As she said on Tuesday in unveiling our demands: “We not going to keep crying. We’re going to march, we’re going to protest and we’re going to vote.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01546b9f20e8f689757ab9cefb9cd2e04da05910/0_36_4007_2404/master/4007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ec7291971286b85c38b87e143f9410ff 1240w","title":"syria assad doing nothing disastrous policy missile strikes","story":"After seven years of failing to act in Syria, we can audit where a non-interventionist policy has got us. It has been an utter catastropheLet’s cut the canting. No one thinks, not those ordering them and not those opposing them, that the missile strikes against the Assad regime will influence the outcome of the catastrophe in Syria. That pass was sold long since. If there was an opportunity for America, Britain and their allies to make a difference for the better, the chance was missed many, many deaths ago. What we are witness to – on the part of both the leaders of the western democracies and their critics – is a tableau of actors striking postures designed to make the players feel better about themselves. This posing can never rewrite the blood-drenched history of a seven-year conflict that has turned Syria into a charnel house and shredded international norms about the conduct of war.The proximate cause of this crisis is the chemical attack on Douma last weekend. After years of unmasterly inactivity by the democracies, it is that atrocity that drew attention back to what is happening in Syria and finally stirred punitive action against Bashar al-Assad. In the words of the ineffable Donald Trump, the retaliatory strikes are supposed to demonstrate to “animal Assad” that there is a “price to pay” for the dictator’s use of banned weaponry. In the more measured language of Theresa May, “we cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to be normalised”. Yet the normalisation of chemical weapons is precisely what has already happened in Syria. Assad’s regime has time and again used chemical warfare to slaughter its own people, as it has also deployed hideous “conventional” weapons such as dropping barrel bombs and fuel-air bombs on civilian areas to inflict mass casualties.Over seven years of relentless savagery in Syria, the hands of the leaders of the western powers have been wedged firmly under their bottoms. They have been encouraged to maintain this impotent posture by legislators too feeble to grip the dilemmas posed by Syria and voters weary of engagement with the hard parts of the world. Listening to both their public pronouncements and their private calculations, the abiding impression is that this belated and limited action by Washington, London and Paris is not driven by any conviction that these strikes will make any meaningful difference. They won’t even stop Assad manufacturing more chemical weapons if he chooses to do so. Missiles are flying mainly to soothe guilt about repeated earlier failures to act.Even so, I give these leaders a little more credit than I can find for those whose only counsel is to do absolutely nothing. At least some of these belated interventionists are wrestling with a genuine dilemma. Action over this chemical attack, when so many previous atrocities have been given a free pass, looks like therapy by Tomahawk, a gesture, not a strategy. But to let yet another use of chemical weapons happen without any form of response would have given a complete sense of impunity to the Assad regime and its sponsors in the Kremlin. Every dictatorship on the planet has been getting the message that there is no penalty for the acquisition and use of weapons prohibited since the First World War and that has chilling implications for future conflicts.The other side of our tableau of posturers is composed of those who oppose this action as they have clamoured against all previous attempts to do something about Syria. The non-interventionists come in two categories. There are the “it’s nothing to do with us” brigade who declare that “we haven’t got a dog in the Syrian fight”. Mainly to be found on the hand-washing right, the cold brutality with which they express their indifference to so much human suffering has the sole merit of being candid.Less honest, not least with themselves, are the self-proclaimed peace-lovers. Mainly to be found on the hand-wringing left, they are too busy looking in the mirror admiring their own halos to face the moral challenges posed by a situation like Syria. Jeremy Corbyn opposes this weekend’s action on the grounds that it “risks escalating further” what is “an already devastating conflict”. The Labour leader and those who share his worldview are consistent. Do nothing has been their unvaried policy for the past seven years of carnage. There is no doubt that they can expect support from a lot of a domestic electorate turned allergic to engaging with abroad, especially the Middle East.As the non-interventionists have preached inaction, the death toll in Syria has been remorselessly – what’s the word, Jeremy? – escalated by the Assad regime and its allies. Whenever pressed to say what they would do, the non-interventionists fall back on calling for “negotiations” and more effort at the United Nations. They have to be aware that Russia has repeatedly used its security council veto to shield Assad from any effective action by the UN, most recently by blocking an independent investigation into the chemical attack on Douma. While the non-interventionists have talked about talking, the Assad regime and its backers in the Kremlin and Iran have been free to go on killing.Some argue that the fatal turning point was the summer of 2013 when Assad’s use of chemical weaponry defied a “red line” drawn by Barack Obama, who then failed to enforce it. That has become the main reference point of the British argument because it was then that David Cameron failed to secure parliamentary approval for participation in punitive air strikes. When MPs turned him down, the then prime minister abandoned any further effort with a huffy “I get that”. The people who really “got it” were the Syrian civilians who continued to die in their thousands.It is possible that intervention at that point might have made some difference. In truth, the west made its gravest decision not to act earlier when Assad responded with vicious suppression to the original uprising against his dictatorship in 2011. Rather than offer succour to the secular democrats who rebelled against the regime, the west stood by as he imprisoned, tortured, executed and crushed those who cried out for freedom. Every force in Syria was provided with resources and weapons except for the liberal opposition. Humanitarian initiatives could have been attempted, such as creating safe havens for civilians and imposing no-fly zones to impede Assad’s ability to slaughter his own people. They weren’t even tried. No meaningful pressure was applied to bring him to the negotiating table. The opposition become dominated by jihadists. Regional powers and Russia moved into the voids left by western inaction.It is not provable whether earlier intervention would have altered the course of Syria’s tragic history. Non-interventionists said then, as they say now, that anything that the west does only makes things worse. That we can’t prove either. What we can see is how bad things have become and it is hard to conceive how exactly it could be worse. After seven years of failing to act in Syria, we can audit where a non-interventionist policy has got us. It has been an utter disaster in every respect.The United Nations struggles to put an exact figure on how many people have died, but best estimates put the number at around half a million. More than 5 million Syrians are refugees abroad and more than 6 million have been internally displaced. Assad has flattened cities and smashed through nearly every international taboo about the conduct of war. The Syrian dictator is massacring his way to victory and there is no one who thinks that this weekend’s missile strikes will in any way impede him. The conflict has inexorably widened and now consumes the region as Syria has been turned into a battlefield for proxy conflicts between regional players. Russia has been encouraged in its belligerence. The west looks helpless. Dictators the world over have been emboldened to believe that they can crush opposition using the most barbaric methods and the rest of the world will do nothing to stop them. Those striving for freedom have been commensurately disheartened. The rule of international law has been weakened.Action has consequences and they are not always the ones intended and hoped for. That was the grisly lesson of Iraq. Inaction also has consequences. Doing nothing can have a price every bit as high. I’d think better of the non-interventionists if they’d ever once admit that. Inaction has been a terrible choice in Syria.Interventionists have been rightly obliged to own all that went horribly wrong in Iraq. Non-interventionists, the horrors of Syria are on you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e632521a77734cbc5fd94a8b36759b091ab99c/189_350_2977_1786/master/2977.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=331d05fa1ccda225a65edc64764cd900 1240w","title":"the guardian view on bombing syria a decision for parliament","story":"Theresa May’s decision to authorise British military action over the skies of Syria by royal prerogative rather than obtaining the backing of parliament was the wrong thing to do. Even if the prime minister thinks it was done for the right reasons. It was wrong because the government’s plans should have been articulated so that MPs could have had a chance to endorse – or reject – a motion to bomb Bashar al-Assad’s weapons factories. It was wrong because there was no emergency – an exception used when after a debate MPs retrospectively endorsed action against Muammar Gaddafi’s Libya. It was wrong because only prime ministers can recall parliament – and there was time to do so. It was wrong because decisions about how to police the unlawful use of weapons of mass destructive terror in Syria turn upon\u0026nbspjudgment rather than available facts.This is a politically significant move by Mrs May. David Cameron became the first British prime minister to see his war plans foiled by parliament since 1782 when 30 of his own MPs in 2013 rebelled against the motion to bomb Syria. It was a humiliating and embarrassing moment but it reflected the weight of British public and political feeling against him. After the style of decision-taking on the road to the Iraq war of 2003, it was commendable that Mr Cameron sought to do something so unpopular as a matter of principle. A year later MPs backed his offensive against Islamic State in Iraq.Mrs May took military action despite public sentiment. She has not carried voters or MPs. She ought to have persuaded the country, if she believed it, that Britain stood to gain in a punitive action of limited duration. If\u0026nbspher defence was that this was unlikely to put Britain’s armed forces in harm’s way, she should have said so. Mrs May should have made parliament own the argument that western allies were making sure their red lines were addressed rather than trying to damage the Assad regime. In not doing so she makes her government culpable for the conduct of a murderous dictator. If Mr Assad decides to use nerve agents or chlorine again to kill and terrify his own people, the onus will be on Mrs May to react.The Syrian president will see no threat to his hold on power and no change on the trajectory of the Syrian war. Even worse, ordinary Syrians will wonder why the west acted after 1,900 people were killed by chemical weapons when 400,000 have lost their lives to conventional weapons in the grisly civil war. Syria will continue as a zone of instability as long as Mr Assad remains in place, with minority Alawite rule – backed by Baathist-favouring Russia and Shia Iran – entrenched over Sunni Arab heartlands. This weekend’s action might prevent Mr Assad’s total victory, but it will not hasten his defeat. Mrs May should have been honest about this to both the public\u0026nbspand parliament before dropping bombs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66beda4b675d94f5bc106f0f1de1e29b1abdbbaa/0_81_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=00050622225f7c13ff9e3cc7a226c9c7 1240w","title":"the guardian view on qe the economy needs more than a magic money tree","story":"When running for the Labour leadership, Jeremy Corbyn wanted a “people’s quantitative easing” to boost the economy. It was frostily dismissed in 2015 as being forbidden by provisions in the Lisbon treaty. If we leave the European Union, those strictures will no longer apply. This is not to agitate on the side of Brexiters but to observe that the quiver of the argument against printing money might lose an arrow or two if we leave the EU. In fact, the Bank of England, while the UK was in the EU, did print hundreds of billions of pounds to avoid economic disaster. At the push of a button, the Bank conjured up £435bn to buy up gilts – government bonds – and exchange them for bank deposits. On the national balance sheet this sum is listed as debt, but it is not in the\u0026nbspstrictest sense because it is not owed to anyone. Turns out there is a magic money tree.Last week, Andy Haldane, the Bank’s chief economist, defended the Bank’s low interest rates and quantitative easing programme from critics, including the prime minister, who have said the policy rewarded those who had assets and penalised those who did not. Mr\u0026nbspHaldane’s defence is that the public has yet to grasp how much worse the crisis would have been without QE. There’s a bit of truth on both sides. Having sold their gilts back to the Bank, investors bought up company stocks and bonds or property – sending prices to record highs – instead of creating new activity in the real economy, higher growth and jobs. Money from bond sales remained stuck in the banking system. The government could have corralled the private sector to make socially useful investment but ministers, antagonistic to the state, sat on their hands. The result was that the injection of money caused a stock-market boom in the financial economy, but on the real economy – the\u0026nbsptarget of the policy – it had little effect.Government spending, however it is financed, needs to be the main agent of recovery. In that sense Conservative ministers are responsible for the costs of the rescue being dumped on to the blameless public in the form of falling living standards and public-service cuts. The lesson from the monetary side of the equation is that low rates and QE succeeded in staving off disaster but was insufficient to regenerate a buoyant and fair economy. This could have been achieved by a redistributive, expansionary fiscal policy which ministers were ideologically resistant to. Hindsight is the easiest form of virtue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f2334c48fa350fd55b37b7134f7d2d93e041719/371_266_1673_1004/master/1673.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=101319c687549800306aba58af1dd460 1240w","title":"un inspectors not bombs peace syria jeremy corbyn","story":"These are serious times. Following the\u0026nbspmissile attacks on Syria, now is the\u0026nbspmoment for a powerful push for peace. Boris Johnson’s blithe acceptance on Sunday that the conflict will now continue on its current course and that peace negotiations would be an “extra” is an unconscionable abdication of responsibility and morality.Already this devastating conflict has cost more than\u0026nbsp500,000 lives and led to 5 million refugees being\u0026nbspforced to flee Syria, and 6 million internally displaced. We must put negotiations for a political settlement centre stage, and not slip into a new cycle of\u0026nbspmilitary reaction and counter-reaction.Protracted external military intervention in Syria –\u0026nbspfrom funding and arms supplies to bombing and boots\u0026nbspon the ground – has not helped in the slightest. Syria has become the theatre for military action by regional and international powers – the United States, Britain, Russia, France, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates among them.Saturday’s attack on sites thought to be linked to Syria’s chemical weapons capability was both wrong and misconceived. It was either purely symbolic – a demolition of what appear to be empty buildings, already shown to be entirely ineffective as a deterrent – or it was the precursor to wider military action. That would risk a reckless escalation of the war and death toll, and the danger of direct confrontation between the US and Russia. Neither possibility offers an end to the war and suffering, or any prospect of saving lives – rather the opposite. The intensification of military action will simply lead to more deaths and more refugees.There can be no question of turning a blind eye to the\u0026nbspuse of chemical weapons. Their deployment constitutes a crime, and those responsible must be held\u0026nbspto account. The Assad government was supposed to\u0026nbsphave given up its chemical munitions stocks (though not chlorine) under the UN-backed agreement of 2013, and hundreds of tonnes were destroyed under the supervision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Russia and the US.Contrary to what is claimed, UN security council agreement was secured then, and again in 2015 and 2016, for an independent UN chemical weapons inspections regime. That can and must be re-established, as both sides in the security council are now proposing.Inspectors must be given full access to collect evidence, as well as additional powers. Russia must be held to its 2013 commitments, and pressure be exerted on the Assad government to cooperate with investigations into the outrage at Douma.The same applies to the armed opposition groups, some Saudi- or western-backed, which have also been implicated in the use of chemical weapons. Pressure can also be applied on those found responsible through sanctions, embargoes and, if necessary, through the international criminal court.Full accountability will depend on an end to the conflict. But there is plenty that can be done now, without adding fuel to the Syrian fire. There are those who are sceptical of multilateral diplomacy. But it is essential to insist on legality and on a UN sanction for any further military action. We can’t accept that a “new cold war” is unavoidable, as the UN secretary general António Guterres has warned. A shift from the rhetoric of endless confrontation with Russia could also help lower the temperature and make a UN consensus for multilateral action to end Syria’s agony more likely.The military action at the weekend was legally questionable. The government’s own justification, which relies heavily on the strongly contested doctrine\u0026nbspof humanitarian intervention, does not even meet its own tests. Without UN authority it was again a matter of\u0026nbspthe US and British governments arrogating to themselves an authority to act unilaterally\u0026nbspwhich they do\u0026nbspnot possess.The fact that the prime minister ordered the attacks without seeking authorisation from parliament only underlines the weakness of a government that was in reality simply waiting for authorisation from a bellicose and unstable US president. That’s why we are pressing for parliament to have the final say on planned military action in future in a new war powers act.Further military action would be reckless. Even more than was the case in the disastrous interventions in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan, the continuing war in Syria is fraught with the danger of a wider conflict, starting with Russia and dragging in Turkey, Iran, Israel and others.Nor is there any political plan on offer. Libya offers the most recent, and calamitous, example of a military operation launched with no thought to the political aftermath. Meanwhile the UK-backed Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster.The British government needs to act as a restraining influence in this crisis, not a camp follower. It is welcome that the UN security council will now be discussing both a new weapons inspections regime and a revival of the stalled peace talks. Such discussions need to be conducted with the aim of agreement, not big power point-scoring.We have to remove the scourge of chemical weapons\u0026nbspbut also use our influence to end the still greater scourge of the Syrian war. A diplomatic solution that will allow for the country to be rebuilt, for refugees to be able to return home and for an inclusive political settlement that allows the Syrian people to decide their own future could not be more urgent.All this, and not a fresh bombing campaign, is what\u0026nbspthe British people want from their government. Now is the moment for moral and political leadership, not kneejerk military responses.• Jeremy Corbyn is the leader of the Labour party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b7c3435f334488a3e1c24cdfea155e94aa43342/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?w=465\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d74b300e40e80fc85319a796683f882b 465w","title":"2001 a space odyssey film haunts dream space","story":"Astronomers last week announced official names for the principal mountains and valleys of one of the solar system’s remotest objects, the tiny world of Charon. More than 3.6bn miles distant from the Sun, the moon – which orbits the dwarf planet, Pluto – was first observed closely in 2015 when the US probe New Horizons swept over its freezing, airless surface.Now the features revealed by the robot craft have been given titles by the International Astronomical Union. And key among the explorers and scientists honoured are the film director Stanley Kubrick and the writer Arthur C Clarke.As a result Kubrick Mons and Clarke Montes are now two of Charon’s major mountains. It is a fitting honour – and timely. The two men’s great collaborative work, the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, was released 50 years ago this month. By putting its creators’ names on the map of Charon, at the edge of the solar system, astronomers are repaying a debt to two visionaries who reshaped our thinking about the cosmos and created a film rated by some as the greatest ever made.Other celebrations of the film’s release include a recreation of the set of the film’s strange bedroom finale, which has just opened at Washington DC’s Air and Space Museum. In addition, the film-maker and writer Michael Benson’s book Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece, is published this week. Benson describes the movie “as an art film made with a Hollywood blockbuster budget that is more comparable to a musical composition than to the usual dialogue-based commercial cinema”.At the time, Kubrick had intended merely to make a science-fiction film that seemed credible. Clunky scripts, cardboard sets and crude cinematography marred most such films. So Kubrick turned to the British writer Clarke and the two worked on a script that slowly swelled in scope and ambition. Eventually they produced a story that covered the origins and destiny of the human species – a journey from ape to angel, as Kubrick put it.According to their story, simple cavemen would encounter intelligent aliens who would help them acquire brainpower and so set humanity on the path to the planets. Once space travel had been achieved, humanity would make further contact with these aliens, who would then help us – after we had survived the murderous attentions of a supercomputer – to turn ourselves into a species with superhuman powers.And this is what Kubrick eventually produced, although significant scenes were altered and dialogue written and rewritten throughout filming at MGM’s British studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Massive sets were constructed and props built and rejected. (The giant monoliths that appear in the film were clear Perspex initially, but were junked for the jet-black\u0026nbspvariety.)The end result is striking. No words are spoken during the film’s first 25 minutes, and of its total 142 minutes’ running time only 40 contain speech. Its finale is enigmatic to the point of inscrutability. Audiences were baffled and more than 200 people, about a sixth of the audience, walked out before the end of the film’s premiere, says Benson. MGM was convinced it had backed “an epic disaster”. Even Clarke was disappointed by the film’s lack of concession to audience understanding, he later recalled.Leading US film critics lined up to rubbish the movie: “trash masquerading as art,” claimed Pauline Kael in Harper’s. Fortunately for MGM, Kubrick and Clarke, this critical misfire was shortlived. The counterculture 1960s were then in full swing and young filmgoers were attracted by word of mouth (and ultimately the film poster’s tag line) suggesting that this was the “ultimate trip” movie. John Lennon even claimed at the time that he was going to see 2001 every week, while David Bowie produced his own musical tribute, Space Oddity, within a year. “Something was happening and older audiences did not necessarily know what it was,” says\u0026nbspBenson.Equally intrigued were young scientists desperate to witness technology that was credible and imaginative, something that had been entirely absent from feature films until then. “The film set new standards for ‘realistic’ portrayal of life in space, overcoming decades of Flash Gordon space-westerns,” says a former teenage astronomer, Professor Ian Christie of Birkbeck, University of London. “It also created a new soundtrack for cosmic spectacle – through the use of the opening of Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra and the music of Ligeti.”Similarly, astronomer Carl Murray, of Queen Mary, University of London, says the film was the first one that made him really think. He later became a member of the imaging team for the Cassini probe sent to Saturn in 2007. “We didn’t see any monoliths, but we all knew we owed a lot to Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubrick for inspiring our\u0026nbspimaginations.”In the end, 2001: A Space Odyssey became the highest-grossing film of 1968 – the only Kubrick picture ever to achieve such a standing. It also won Kubrick his only Oscar: for best visual effects (although they were actually the work of Douglas\u0026nbspTrumbull).The film also stimulated a generation of young cinema enthusiasts who have since dominated film-making. James Cameron, George Lucas, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan have all acknowledged 2001 as a key influence on their output. “Stanley Kubrick made the ultimate science-fiction movie. It is going to be very hard for someone to come along and make a better movie, as far as I’m concerned,” says Lucas, creator of the Star Wars franchise.This view is maintained by the current generation of younger directors, such as Gareth Edwards, director of Rogue One, one of the more recent Star Wars films. “It is a movie blockbuster while also being as artistic and abstract as you can get. No one would bankroll a film like this again. It is a phenomenon of its time,” Edwards told the Observer.The film is not without its flaws, of course. In the early “Dawn of Man” sequences, Moonwatcher the apeman is inspired – by an alien monolith – to pick up a bone to use as a weapon, thus triggering an intellectual evolution that ends 4 million years later in modern humans and their propensity for war. The idea that violence underpins the human intellect is based on the ideas of anthropologist Raymond Dart, which were popularised in the 1960s by the writer Richard Ardrey, but which have since been discredited.“They don’t reflect current thinking,” says palaeontologist Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London. “Bones may have been used as tools, but for digging for roots and insects – not as clubs. That said, 2001 is still one of my favourite films – dazzling and mystifying in equal measure.”There is another intriguing aspect about the timing of the film’s release. In 1968 humanity then seemed set for the stars. Only a few months after the film’s release, Apollo astronauts had reached the Moon and with a year had landed on it. The rest of the solar system would soon be conquered, it seemed. Space flight would become common. The film’s eponymous dateline therefore seemed prescient. However, the Vietnam war and other budgetary constraints ended that dream, though Clarke, who died in 2008, always remained\u0026nbspoptimistic about the prospects of further\u0026nbspexploration.In an interview at the end of the last century, he was asked what went wrong with his prediction. “Nothing very much, “ he replied. “America and Russia didn’t bother building more powerful, reusable launchers – they had other things on their minds – and that has made space too expensive for widespread use. Someone soon is going to get round that problem, however, and when that happens all the space stations and moonbases we envisaged will come about. I am very confident of that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"manchester city premier league champions","story":"Vincent Kompany has challenged his Manchester City team-mates to retain their Premier League title after Manchester United’s shock defeat to the bottom side, West Brom, confirmed Pep Guardiola’s men as champions.With Kompany watching on at his wife’s family home after City’s 3-1 victory over Tottenham on Saturday evening meant United had to avoid defeat against Albion to keep the title race alive, Jay Rodriguez’s goal at Old Trafford ensured the trophy will head to the other side of Manchester for the third time in seven seasons.“You can’t take them for granted – I’ve been lucky to win three but there have been so many I’ve missed as well,” said Kompany. “Today I’m happy and I suppose my team-mates will roll their eyes a little bit but I kind of want to see what the reaction is going to be now. I’ve never retained the title and I want to see if this team has got it to carry on and be even more successful.”He added: “I had that feeling when I woke up this morning but I don’t like to wait and see a team lose so it was a little bit of a different experience today. West Brom are a good team and they don’t deserve to be that low and as they stuck into the game you realised that something could happen. It was a set piece and a lovely goal from Rodriguez so thank you. It was a great feeling.”Guardiola, who said on Saturday that he would be playing golf rather than watching the match, can now add a Premier League winner’s medal to those he claimed in the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich and La Liga with\u0026nbspBarcelona. City players posted celebratory messages on Twitter with Kevin De Bruyne writing: “Unbelievable season for us. Very happy to call us champions this year.”Confirmation of the title success comes as a fillip at the end of a difficult spell for City, during which they lost in the Manchester derby and suffered a Champions League exit at the hands of Liverpool. By completing the job after 33 games, City have emulated the achievement of United, who also secured the crown with five matches to spare in 2001.The Manchester United manager, José Mourinho, said City’s consistency had earned them the title. “Manchester City won the title because they won more points than everybody else, because yesterday they won against Tottenham, because during the season they lost only two matches,” he said.Speaking after the victory over Tottenham which took him to the verge of his 20th trophy as a manager, Guardiola singled out the win over Chelsea in September as the moment his side believed they could triumph.“We played so well in many, many games,” he said. “I think winning in Stamford Bridge gave us the confidence that we could do it. Last season against contenders was not so good – we won few games. Against the last champions that gave us the belief that we were able to go there and play the way we played. But in general we were so stable. We conceded goals but the most important detail is not the goals you concede but the chances we concede. In every game it was few.”Worryingly for City’s rivals, there are no signs that this is the culmination of their journey either. As Guardiola pointed out, the majority of his squad have youth on their side and yet more investment will no doubt follow in the summer. But while their manager admitted the relative inexperience of some of his players may have counted against them in the Champions League, Guardiola believes the standards they have set this season can be an inspiration for the future.“We won with guys who are so young – sometimes playing with guys who that age in the Champions League is complicated. But maybe it was a good lesson for the club for next season,” he said.“Of course the same isn’t going to happen next season but that is the target. We were able to do it once and that means you can do it twice. We have to try next season to be better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f69e346dffb5ff1c8e518b0f6ab32b217db392b8/4_196_3859_2316/master/3859.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=24ebe0f6ccd35d2784ee0c54300798e0 1240w","title":"manchester united west bromwich albion premier league match report","story":"The only surprise, perhaps, is that Manchester United have kept the title race going as long as they have when they are capable of playing this abysmally. They find themselves 16 points behind Manchester City, the newly crowned Premier League champions. Their goal difference is 31 inferior to Pep Guardiola’s team and the final twist in the story of a one-sided title race counts as a humiliation for a club with their haughty ambitions.It was a defeat at home by the Premier League’s wooden-spoon team, with the Old Trafford stands barely half-full and the players booed off by many of the people who had chosen not to leave early. Was this really the team who won 3-2 at City in one of the season’s great comebacks? It was only eight days earlier that Mourinho’s players could be seen throwing their shirts into a euphoric away end at the Etihad Stadium. Now they were wandering around like zombies, drenched in a Mancunian downpour, losing against the worst team in the league.Mourinho called his players the “masters of complicated football” but that was being generous after one of the more startling displays of his two years in charge. West Brom have been submerged in the relegation quicksands since December. Their previous away win in the league came in August and there has been only one other occasion in the Premier League years, against Blackburn Rovers in 2011, when United have lost at home against the league’s bottom club.Even when Jay Rodriguez headed in the decisive goal, in the 73rd minute, it was alarming to see the lack of fight from a team, lest it be forgotten, that have won this league 20 times. Sir Alex Ferguson used to boast there was no other side in the world who scored as many late goals as his – but not the current version. United drifted aimlessly towards the final whistle without ever looking as if they had the wit or gumption to save themselves. Thousands of people had gone before the end. “Manchester City, we’ve won you the league,” was the cry from the West Brom fans.On this evidence perhaps West Brom ought to have put Darren Moore in charge earlier in the season. As it is, they can still be relegated next weekend and their victory will be remembered as an almost freakish result from an otherwise wretched season. Yet a result of this nature must enhance Moore’s chances of being given the job full-time and the only possible mitigation for United was that their opponents appeared to have dramatically improved since Alan Pardew’s departure.All the same it was difficult to find any plausible excuse for a team that finished with Alexis Sánchez, Romelu Lukaku, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Juan Mata on the pitch but barely landed a glove on willing but limited opponents. Mourinho said he could “smell” a performance of this nature coming, complaining there had been a noticeable deterioration on the training ground since beating City. His players, in other words, have started choosing their games and, in the case of Paul Pogba in particular, it would have been no surprise if Mourinho picked up the stench of complacency.Pogba might have risen to the challenge against City, with two of the goals in United’s second-half comeback, but when he can play with that kind of authority it makes it even more perplexing that he can follow it up by having this kind of stinker. He dawdled his way through 57 minutes and there was no dissent from the crowd when Mourinho decided the team’s record signing should be removed so early. Mourinho was in such a dark mood afterwards it would be no surprise if Pogba loses his place against Bournemouth on Wednesday, or even in the FA\u0026nbspCup semi-final against Tottenham on Saturday.Not that it was all the fault of one player. At one point Pogba had the ball 20 yards inside the opposition half and was so irritated by the lack of movement from his team-mates he put his studs on top of the ball and held out his arms to protest. Unfortunately, when a player with his uncommon ability can play so listlessly he is not in any position to preach.West Brom had a let-off in the first half when the referee, Paul Tierney, gave Craig Dawson the benefit of the doubt for a penalty-box challenge that put Ander Herrera on the floor. Ben Foster denied Lukaku with two fine saves and there was another occasion when the United striker had the chance to go through the middle only to be let down by his control. Yet the reality for United is that there was never a part of the match when it became a backs-to-the-wall operation for a team that is bound for the Championship.The most inviting chance of the first half was the one for Jake Livermore, after 11 minutes, when David de\u0026nbspGea’s one-handed save denied him beneath the Stretford End. West Brom played with a sense of adventure that seemed to surprise their hosts.

Had the impressive Jonjo Shelvey finally done enough to convince Gareth Southgate to offer him a place on England’s World Cup flight to Russia? Might Benítez’s achievement in overseeing Newcastle’s collection of 22 points from a possible 36 since New Year’s Day earn him the manager of the year award? And, crucially, will Arsenal’s failure to collect a single point on the domestic road during 2018 finally spell the end for Wenger in north London?They may be looking forward to a Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid but this was the visitors’ fifth straight Premier League away defeat. It provided plenty of clues as to why Wenger’s side remain a disappointing sixth, only four places ahead of Newcastle.In mitigation, Arsenal’s Europa League quarter-final draw at CSKA Moscow on Thursday night was followed by a 5am Friday landing at Luton airport. After a dominant first‑half display here, that rude awakening appeared to catch up with them, with fatigue clearly intruding.Initially though a visiting XI featuring the 18-year-old attacking midfielder Joe Willock making his league debut looked neither overly tired nor missing the absent Mesut Özil – given the day off.Instead Alexandre Lacazette volleyed Arsenal into an early lead at the end of a wonderfully fluent attacking move also featuring Shkodran Mustafi’s 60-yard pass and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s adhesive control and intelligent square ball.It was Aubameyang’s second visit to the north-east, the first having come when he played 2012 Olympic football for Gabon at St James’ Park. Then Aubameyang and friends limbered up with a friendly at nearby Northern League club Heaton Stannington, where he caused quite a stir by arriving in a pair of £2,500 Swarovski crystal-encrusted trainers.Ayoze Pérez – who cost Newcastle a relatively modest £1.5m – is unlikely to ever command the £56m that Arsenal paid for Aubameyang but, almost imperceptibly, the young Spaniard has grown into what initially seemed an unnatural No\u0026nbsp10 role in Benítez’s hallmark formation.So much so that Pérez has now scored three times in the last three games, with the latest pulling Newcastle right back into things on Sunday.In some ways almost a carbon copy of Arsenal’s opener, the equaliser began with a fine 50-yard delivery from Shelvey. Once Dwight Gayle had brought the playmaker’s pass under seamless control and Mustafi – defensively disappointing throughout – negligently stood off, the striker fed DeAndre Yedlin. The right-back’s superb low cross was met by Pérez’s right foot and the ball arrowed beyond Petr Cech.Martin Dubravka’s arrival on loan from Sparta Prague in January has been a key factor behind Newcastle’s renaissance – significantly Lacazette’s goal was the first the Slovakia goalkeeper had conceded at St James’ Park – but bar a momentary brain freeze on Willock’s part he would surely have been beaten again just before half-time.When Mo Diamé slipped, Lacazette was gifted possession and the striker’s pass seemed to have cued the teenager up for a memorable goal but Willock got his feet in an awful tangle and a glorious chance evaporated.The afternoon had turned into an intriguing tactical duel between Arsenal’s slick possession game (featuring the odd encouragingly mature cameo from Willock before his replacement by Danny Welbeck) and the counterattacking strategy that has enabled Benítez to overachieve greatly this season.If the containment capabilities of the vastly improved Jamaal Lascelles and Paul Dummett should not be underestimated, Shelvey’s defence-splitting contributions alongside the quietly influential Diamé have frequently changed games. Against Arsenal Shelvey did much to suggest that Southgate is wrong to continue turning a blind eye to his England candidacy. After all, an unusually subdued Mohamed Elneny would surely not relish facing Shelvey and Diamé every week.As Elneny and company’s legs grew heavier, Islam Slimani, on for Gayle, created Newcastle’s second goal with a header across the area. That delivery allowed Pérez to contribute a clever dummy and neat flick, leaving Matt Ritchie to lift an accomplished chip over Cech, with Nacho Monreal culpable.With Slimani creating havoc, Kenedy subsequently hit the bar and the Blaydon Races was sung ever louder. Beneath a tepid April sun, one team was crumbling. For once, it was not Newcastle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7b8d44ab52adf755a83c54fcb2dab822b5d81e8/50_871_1864_1118/master/1864.jpg?w=1750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdf24d3f26623ca5dd498d9397f94dcd 3500w","title":"who would like to live under the sea","story":"Plenty of people, according to Phil Nuytten, the man who has designed and plans to build a city beneath the wavesPhil Nuytten first decided he wanted to spend his life underwater when he was six years old. It was 1947. The Second World War had only recently ended. Nuytten’s dad had scored a job at Boeing, and the firm’s office in Vancouver Harbour was just a short walk away from the family home. Every now and then Nuytten would waltz down to the harbour unaccompanied, sneak out to the end of the docks, peer through the cracks and fall hopelessly in love with what he saw: fish, anemones, a teeming underworld. “I used to think: ‘Gosh, wouldn’t it be wonderful to go down there?’” he says. “To go down to that particular place?”Nuytten and I are sitting in his office, a wood-clad two-storey workshop on an industrial section of the North Vancouver shoreline not far from where he grew up. He is in his 70s now, scrupulously groomed and graciously quick-witted, with an old-time mariner’s flair for storytelling. He is also believed to be one of the world’s leading deep-ocean explorers. During a six-decade career he has pioneered ing techniques that are now industry standard, designed underwater machinery that has become a staple of several navies, and recorded world-first es.He has studied oil fields, surveyed dams, toured submarine construction sites and explored sunken wrecks. His firm, Nuytco Research, boasts a client list that includes the BBC, Greenpeace and film director James Cameron – Nuytten provided ideas and apparatus for The Abyss and Titanic and the pair remain friends. Nuytten also develops equipment for Nasa and, because the seabed is in some ways analogous to the surface of Mars, trains astronauts. Nuytten never went to college. He is almost entirely self-taught, yet the impact he’s had on ocean exploration has been vast.Now Nuytten is about to embark on a project likely to become his showpiece: a vast underwater colony, decades in development, that will provide humanity with an escape hatch should things go to pot above ground. Work will begin on a prototype later this year. A larger colony will follow soon after. So long as everything goes to plan, hundreds and then thousands of people will begin to migrate to the sea floor, to play out their lives at the bottom of the ocean in much the same way they would have done above ground. Before long, many more will follow.Whether or not everything will go to plan is difficult to judge. “It’s a harsh environment,” James McFarlane of International Submarine Engineering tells me. “You’ve got salt water, corrosion… And when you get into the water things start to get expensive fairly rapidly.” Still, Nuytten is determined. He has given his entire life to developing methods that allow humans to spend inhuman amounts of time underwater, often at unimaginable depths. Now he’s in the final throes of a mission to move us all down there – and once we’re there, he doesn’t think we’ll ever want to come back up. “I have this wonderful picture in my mind,” he says. “A little kid is sitting on his dad’s knee, just as I used to do, and he points to the ceiling of this habitat and says: ‘Dad, is it true people used to live up there?’”The idea the human race might one day live at the bottom of the ocean is not new – underwater habitats have been popping up in shallow waters since the early 1960s. In 1962 a French duo, Albert Falco and Claude Wesly, spent a week inside a minuscule habitat designed in part by the French explorer Jacques Cousteau. It sat 33ft below the surface on the sea floor close to Marseille and looked like a watery space station. The following year Cousteau convinced a five-person team to live for a month beneath the Red Sea, off the coast of Sudan. Two years later he developed a third base, Conshelf III, which he anchored more than 300ft below the surface off the coast near Nice. A six-person team lived there for three weeks. Every day they left the base to work on a mock-up oil rig. It was hoped inhabitants would perform similar work in the future, by which point the rig would be real.Before long, additional habitats materialised off the coasts of Bermuda, California and Germany. Bases were funded by governments, wealthy patrons or the petrochemical industry, and there was huge academic optimism. Here was an opportunity for scientists better to study the ocean’s inky depths, aquanauts to study human anatomy, energy companies to discover alternate resource streams and ers to launch record-breaking descents.“In the 60s everybody in the ocean business firmly believed there would be cities under the sea in fairly short order,” Nuytten says. “Never happened.”By the end of the decade the race to colonise the bottom of the ocean slowed to a trot, then all but petered out. The habitats were expensive to build and even more expensive to run. The lack of natural light could send tenants loopy. And, because the bases were built at ambient pressure, decompression periods were long and risky. Teams would spend weeks at a base, conduct tests, learn more about the limits of human endurance, slowly resurface to land and, in many cases, never return. One by one the habitats were abandoned. Research institutions erted funds elsewhere. Government agencies shifted their attention skyward. Space replaced the Earth’s oceans as our final frontier.At the time Nuytten was still a rookie in the ocean industry. He had begun to work on the concepts for which he would later be lauded, but Cousteau’s experiments, which to many seemed more like science fiction than reality, never strayed far from his mind. The subject became a kind of obsession. What if he could create a habitat that was cheaper to build and cheaper to run? What if he could find a way to reproduce the natural light man needs to exist comfortably? What if he could overcome problems caused by the deep ocean’s almighty pressure? And what if he could do what Cousteau and his contemporaries could not: convince society it would be a good idea to live 3,000ft under the sea?In his office, Nuytten tells me he works best when big questions like these loom overhead. “I run around looking for needs so I can fill them in. I like to have about 10 things on the go at once.” Nuytten is a perennial tinkerer, most effective when there are problems to solve, and the barriers to successful underwater living posed interesting problems.By the end of the 60s he had begun work on his own colony, which he began to refer to as Vent Base Alpha. Every now and then he’d scribble ideas on paper scraps and file them away, gradually accumulating hypotheses. Whenever he developed a new piece of technology, usually for a client, he’d experiment with how it might be incorporated within plans for the base. Sometimes a sketch would lead to a breakthrough, and he’d be able to understand what went wrong the first time someone tried to live under-water. What followed was half a century of successes and setbacks. Now a working vision has emerged.Here’s how Nuytten plans to build the colony. First, he’ll forage for equipment in what he calls “the boneyard”, a huge lot in which he stores discarded apparatus. (“I never throw anything away. I am a hoarder.”) He’ll locate a stack of abandoned saturation tanks and convert them into living quarters, laboratories, a series of floodable airlocks and a hangar for submersibles, each tank impeccably welded to the next. Later, he’ll equip the structure with a Stirling engine capable of producing the electricity required to create artificial sunlight, allow inhabitants to grow crops and, crucially, enable them to “crack water into hydrogen and oxygen”. Nuytten relays this last piece of information urgently. “There’s your life support,” he says.The colony will be transported to open water, most likely the Juan de Fuca Strait, a 154km-long outlet to the Pacific Ocean south of Vancouver Island. It will be submerged and hauled to the sea bed a few thousand feet below, and then it will be installed next to a hydrothermal vent – a kind of underwater geyser. The vent will give the colony its name, its hot emissions will power the Sterling engine and its mineral-rich deposits will be mined. Inhabitants will trade the bounty – laboratory-pure cobalt, in the case of the Juan de Fuca Strait – with buyers above the surface. Nuytten will make no financial gain from the project. Funding will come from government agencies, though Nuytten will forgo requesting official permission over whether or not a huge heap of metal can be attached to the ocean floor, preferring instead to “beg for forgiveness” after the installation – his customary strategy. (The prototype, in contrast, will be sanctioned by an offshoot of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, a government body, and anchored in the Burrard Inlet, not far from Nuytten’s office.)When the colony is complete, Nuytten will be among the first to take the plunge. His wife Mary, to whom he has been married for more than 60 years, will follow. As will his daughter, Virginia, if only for a visit. “I’m a mad-keen gardener,” she tells me over the phone. “If I couldn’t have my plants with me, I wouldn’t want to be there.” Soon enough, the family will be joined by other members of the ocean community: scientists, engineers, oceanographers, as well as James Cameron, who has already reserved a berth. Within a few weeks the base’s early tenants – a dozen or so people – will have settled into a routine.At least in the beginning, inhabitants will live underwater for months at a time, though they will be able to come and go. The atmosphere within the colony will tally with that on the surface, eradicating the requirement for decompression and making travel between the two worlds “like taking an elevator down to the parking garage”, explains Nuytten. But, soon enough, we will live at 3,000ft below as though it were normal. The colony will expand. More and more people will slip below the surface to begin second lives, and new colonies will appear around the world. Our routines won’t change, just the environments in which we perform them. We will do the things we normally do: commute to work, gossip with friends, spend inordinate amounts of time on social media. There will be underwater hospitals, banks, galleries, offices, parks, gyms, cinemas, farms, maybe even a forest or two. Children will be born in the colony. Eventually they will die there, too.But all of that will come down the line. First, Nuytten says: “We’ll have to figure out what we want to do down there.” He stops, then adds: “None of this has been done.”During our conversation Nuytten shows me an artist’s impression of the base. It’s an image of a structure that looks much like an underwater power station – a great mass of welded metal, similar to that of a rig. To the right of the picture a hydrothermal vent spouts sooty emissions and ers mine the ocean floor for minerals. Inside, inhabitants resembling Star Trek characters tend to operations. The surrounding environment looks dark and eery, a permanent night. You’d have a hard time working out what time of day the image depicts.I ask Nuytten why we would ever need to live underwater. “We need a second place to go,” he says. “There’s less and less space on Earth, and fewer and fewer resources. And here’s a whole ocean filled with them.” Nuytten is a fierce conservationist. “The oceans are the lungs of this planet. If they go, the planet goes.” In his grand vision, the colony is a kind of salvage operation. It will enable humanity to alleviate the burden it has placed on land. “We’ve demonstrated there will come a time when the planet as we know it will not be able to support the population. The population keeps growing and growing, and with climate change and natural disasters on land getting to be excessive… As far as we know, those same things aren’t happening under the sea. That’s one of the things we want to study: what are the effects of climate change on the deep ocean? We know what the effect is on the shallow regions, the coral reefs, but what about 3,000ft down? What’s happening there?”But how easy will it be to convince other people to take the plunge? “They’d batter the doors down,” he said. “Literally. I’ve given a lot of talks on this, and I’ve had all kinds of people, from wackos to really serious people, saying: ‘If you do this, we want to go.’”This seems like a hopeful response. Nuytten has spent much of his life below the surface. To him, the ocean is home. But what about the rest of us? What about the isolation? What about not being able to go anywhere any time we wanted? Won’t we miss the sun?Nuytten tells the story of an advertisement he’d heard had once been placed in a local UK newspaper. It read, “Wanted: people to go to Antarctica. Poor pay. No guarantee of success. Doing things no one has done before.” “They were inundated with applications,” Nuytten recalls. “I expect that to be the case with this. There are so many people, particularly young people, who are desperately trying to figure out what to do, what they can do that nobody else has done, things that are difficult, things that will protect our oceans.” The first inhabitants will be pioneers, Nuytten believes. “Once you have the first group down there, staying a few months, the next batch will show up.”Nuytten is in no doubt the colony will succeed. “There were an awful lot of people who said we’d never fly in the air,” he tells me. “And even more who said we’d never go to the moon.” But his comment is underpinned by a more urgent message, one that moved the conversation away from personal success and into the realms of societal requirement. “What are we going to do if something catastrophic happens to where we live?” he says, resignedly. “We have to have some place to go.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73741041641331fb56d9e5df72936455b02ce842/0_22_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8e1b54868d1e3ed72d266eb9484cb88e 1240w","title":"happy lane why i love living in bristol","story":"Abandoning his habitual mickey-taking, Nikesh Shukla examines his home town’s glories, from seagulls to street partiesDo you even like living in Bristol?” a friend asks me. “Reading your column every week, it would seem…’ She stops mid-sentence. I get what she’s saying. Whenever people ask me whether I enjoy living here, I do that classic British thing, best exemplified by how we follow football – I trash it because I love it. I take the piss out of it and I keep it in its place through mockery and misery, because that beats admitting how much I love it. The city and I have a complicated relationship, what can I say? Here is a non-exhaustive list of things I love about the place, you know… for balance:1. I live near a long road called Happy Lane. It looks positively post-apocalyptic. Every time I cycle down it, I feel happy mostly because of the mismatch. Not because of the community graffiti that tries to hide the sad brickwork.2. On getting off the bus, people shout, “Cheers, drive!” to the driver as they go past. Obviously it’s polite to thank the driver for the journey, even if they rolled their eyes at your fiver and you got stuck in traffic, making you 20 minutes late for a meeting. Obviously you thank them. But “Cheers, drive”? Come on. It’s adorable.3. During the particularly cold weather we’ve had recently, a bunch of people bought up loads of woolly hats, gloves and scarves, and left them around the city, with a label saying: “I’m not lost. If you need me to keep warm, take me.” Bristol has an innate thoughtfulness.4. At the Watershed cinema, filmgoers are encouraged to write down reviews on index cards and pin them on a board. One person, without fail, declares every single film: “NOT AS GOOD AS JURASSIC PARK.”5. I was once walking across a bridge, eating an ice cream. A seagull, on an attack mission, dove into my ice cream and managed to abscond with everything but the cone. I stood there for a second, stunned, staring at an empty cone. I noticed a man, dressed as a pirate to attract tourists, staring at me. Our eyes locked. He burst into laughter. “Ere mate, get yourself another,” he said, offering me a pound coin. I smiled at his small act of kindness and bought myself another ice cream. I ate it in the safety of the shop this time.6. Bristol is the street-party capital of Europe, apparently.7. Most places will be guaranteed to have at least one night dedicated to mid-90s hip-hop, and the ageing b-boy in me is comforted by never being too far away from a night that will drop Large Professor remixes of Nas tunes.8. Everywhere in the main hub of the city is within walking distance.9. Rice \u0026amp Things, a Caribbean restaurant in Stokes Croft, lights a barbecue at 7am on Fridays to make jerk chicken. Even in the snow. The smell is amazing.10. When my daughter was a month old, I used to walk around the city to get her to sleep. It was the height of summer, and she only fell into a deep sleep in a sling. So I strapped her to me and we walked the entire city. We walked to the mosque in Totterdown, to the mandir in St George, all around the university campus, along the harbourside to look at the SS Great Britain as the sun went down and to a comedy gig in Bedminster to see a set by a friend. We even met Neneh Cherry. The baby slept and I walked. I got to know the city well. I started to fall in love with it.There are problems in Bristol, too, of course. The legacy of slavery isn’t properly acknowledged. The terrible public transport gives people less ownership of the city. The lack of affordable housing is a huge issue. These all feel like big things compared to the lighter vignettes I’ve listed. But these moments make me feel this place is home. And knowing there are big problems here... Well, I’m like that pub football pundit analysing, deconstructing and proselytising about the team he adores and criticises so freely. I’m that guy.

The publicly owned broadcaster is also webcasting the event to invitees across the UK who cannot attend in person. Channel 4 will distribute a 15-page brochure outlining what it is looking for and the timeline for submissions with final decisions on the “winning” locations due in the third quarter.The initiative, called 4 All in the UK, will be the biggest structural change in the broadcaster’s 35-year history: it will open three new “creative hubs” in the nations and regions, with the largest to be a new national HQ that will have facilities including a TV studio and host executive and board meetings. The plans include 300 of its 800 staff moving out of the capital – currently only 30 staff are based outside London, 25 sales people in Manchester and five employees in Glasgow. Channel 4 News will open three new news bureaux, with a trebling of news jobs in the nations and regions by 2020, while spend on shows made by TV production companies based outside London will rise from £169m annually to about £350m a year by 2023.More than a dozen cities and regions across the UK – including Birmingham and Manchester, Brighton, Bristol, Nottingham, Sheffield and Hull – have expressed an interest in hosting a new Channel 4 headquarters and benefiting from the broadcaster’s largesse.The lobbying has already been intense, with Andy Street, the John Lewis managing director turned west Midlands mayor, describing his region as the “frontrunner”.Channel 4 will have to tread carefully to make sure any enticements and inducements offered by bidders to try to win the pitch process do not break state aid rules.Government rules say that state aid is “any advantage granted by public authorities through state resources on a selective basis to any organisations that could potentially distort competition and trade in the European Union”.“Like any company, Channel 4 will have regard to all relevant legal and regulatory obligation in this process,” said a spokeswoman for the broadcaster. “We have robust processes in place for all our third-party business arrangements, which will also apply as we progress the selection of our new locations.”Birmingham was quickest out of the blocks with plans in place to offer two prime HQ locations, including a site near the city centre’s proposed high-speed rail station. The sites were in part identified by the local enterprise partnership, which at the time was chaired by Street. The UK’s second largest city is already benefiting from the BBC boosting its presence. This year, BBC3 is moving half of its operation there, including responsibility for a third of its £30m budget. It is also the home of a new youth team for BBC News and the base for the corporation’s partnership with local newspapers.An early favourite, the city has gone very quiet on the lobbying front since former culture secretary Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, wrote directly to former culture secretary Karen Bradley as part of an “ambitious bid”. He said Greater Manchester was “the only viable alternative outside of London”.MediaCity in Salford already hosts a BBC base of about 2,700 transplanted from London housing sport, CBeebies, Radio 5 Live, Breakfast and Learning, as well as programmes such as Mastermind and Dragons’ DenITV also has a significant operation, including 750 staff working on productions including Coronation Street.

Her cynical, defiantly un-sunny pop anthem New Rules was an improbable song-of-the-summer last July. Streamed online more than 1bn times since, it has helped establish this 22-year-old Londoner as pop’s beach-storming new conquistador – a winner of two Brit awards in February, and the first female artist to be nominated for five. Lipa has an unusual name and history (she comes from a family of Kosovan academics, parted in the 1990s by war), a room-stilling presence (she stands 6ft-plus in heels), and a talent for hanging together pop-music contradictions, specialising in floor-filling bangers that are somehow both jaded and buoyant, universal and intimate. She’s interesting in a number of ways, all of which I want to explore when I meet her one morning in London, towards the end of her Observer cover shoot. Before anything else, though, we discuss her hands.Specifically Lipa’s palms, which are as tough and as work-worn as a lumberjack’s. It’s as if Lipa has spent the week up to now baking bricks, or fighting in a cage. Laughing about it, sighing, Lipa passes her hands around so that everyone in the studio can have a feel. She blames her personal trainer. “We lift a lot of weights,” she says. “We box.” And the crowds on her recent world tour, Lipa points out, wouldn’t just rouse themselves. “I feel like I’ve spent about a year clapping these hands together and shouting: ‘Come on!’”Lipa is bright, good fun, not easily cowed. She asks to feel my palms and after briefly investigating these pearly idler’s mitts she plants on me a brilliantly sceptical stare, as if to ask: have you ever done a hard day’s work? She’s proud of her work ethic. Last week she was gigging in Australia, where some nights, to the squealy delight of her fans, she not only sang but manned the arena merch stands. “It’s a 24-hour job,” she tells me. “And at this point I want to be able to say yes to everything. Every tour, every show, every shoot, every whatever.”We’re in a warehouse in east London, one of those vast places that’s been whitewashed and stud-walled to make it into a multipurpose space, part studio, part gallery. Now that the glowering and vogueing of the photoshoot is over, Lipa puts on patterned jeans and a loose cream jumper, inside the collar of which she tucks a fistful of her dark shoulder-length hair. She needs a tea and a sit, so together we set off through the warehouse corridors to find somewhere. There’s a small glass-walled room abutting the gallery, and as both are deserted it seems a sensible place to put ourselves. Then midday rolls by, and people wander in off the street to admire the art. Some glance through at Lipa, out of reach and out of earshot beyond a wall of glass.It strikes Lipa as she sips her tea that this all amounts to a pretty good analogy for a pop career. Sitting – exposed, apart and a touch ridiculous – in a giant transparent\u0026nbspbox.“You want to be as honest as possible in the music you make,” she says, thinking not so much of her smash single New Rules, which Lipa did not write herself, as of songs such as Blow Your Mind (Mwah) and IDGAF, Lipa’s blunt, sweary postscripts on unhappy love affairs. She continues: “But then there’s the other side of it, when you do want a bit of a personal life, and you get upset that you’ve opened yourself up so much.” She shrugs inside the cream jumper, which unlooses some of her hair. “I guess it comes with the territory – a figuring-out of the right balance, how to be really content, y’know, in this see-through box I’m now living in.”As I said before, she isn’t easily cowed. Earlier this year Lipa read a comment by one of her fans online and took a moment to respond to it. This was as ephemeral as any social media moment, a come-and-go thing that in the end amounted to a few dozen characters on Twitter. But when I read about the incident (which the tabloids wrote up as a minor scandal) I was intrigued, because it seemed a rare example of a pop star breaking character – to remind the public just how silly and how unreal this whole pop game is. Lipa had just separated from her boyfriend, Paul Klein, of the US rock band LANY and now there was gossipy speculation she was back in touch with an ex, a chef called Isaac Carew. One fan thought of the lyrics to Lipa’s New Rules, in which the dos and don’ts of a break-up were carefully itemised (“One, don’t pick up the phone…”).“Sis,” this fan tweeted at Lipa. “You broke the new rules.”“Sis,” Lipa wrote back a minute later. It was the middle of the night. “Get a grip.”Pop should be taken lightly, Lipa believes. “It has to be fun. You’ve got to enjoy it. You can’t get upset about every little thing.” Music after all is the escape – the real world has plenty of methods for upsetting us\u0026nbspalready.And so we discuss geopolitics, and Lipa’s family history. She comes from a large family of ethnic Albanians, to whom “so much has happened”, she says, “in my grandparents’ lives, and my parents’ lives… When you try to come to it and grasp everything there, it’s a lot.” She does her best to boil down their complicated story.Her mother, Anesa, was born to a Kosovan father and a Bosnian mother. In the 90s, war came first to Bosnia, where Anesa’s mother lived, and then to Kosovo, where by now Anesa was living with her fiance, Dukagjin Lipa. Dukagjin was the son of a well-known historian, Seit Lipa, who at that time was the head of the Kosovo Institute of History. When conflict began to brew in Kosovo, Seit’s career abruptly ended. As Lipa tells it: “Once the Serbians came in, they wanted a lot of the historians to rewrite the history of Kosovo. To change it – that Kosovo was always part of Serbia and never part of Yugoslavia. And my grandfather was one of those people who wouldn’t, so he lost his job, because he didn’t want to write a history that he didn’t believe to be true.”In 1992, Dukagjin and Anesa sought refuge in London, while their parents stayed behind in Kosovo and Bosnia. Seit Lipa died in 1999, the year that the Kosovo war ended. “He had a heart attack. And because the borders were closed, my father couldn’t go back to see him.”Lipa was born in north-west London in 1995. “I’ve seen my parents work every day of my life,” she says. In Kosovo her father was training to be a dentist, her mother to be a lawyer. Sudden flight to London threw all this over, and for a long time Lipa’s parents worked as waiters in cafes and bars. In the evenings, her father took business courses. Her mother retrained in travel and tourism. “While I was going to school they were going to\u0026nbspschool.”Flight and sanctuary form the backbone of her family story, and I ask Lipa what she has made of recent political flailings – specifically President Trump’s crowing about his border wall, and before that the extremist Brexiters with their scare-stories about refugees. Lipa says that coming from a background such as hers, “you understand something on a personal level. That no refugee leaves their country without having to.” As for Brexit itself, “I see how important it is for Kosovo, for Kosovans, to be a part of the EU, what it means for them to be a part of something like that. So it’s heartbreaking.” On Trump she takes the long view – very much the historian’s granddaughter. “Later down the line I think we’ll be able to see very clearly, when we put someone like Trump in power, what went wrong. And the hope is we’ll learn from it.”We talk about that amazing name – her grandmother’s suggestion, she says, as dua is the Albanian word for love. “Now I’m proud of it. Now I am. But when I was growing up all I wanted was to be called Hannah, Sarah, Ella… anything normal. Because with Dua you had to explain: I’m from Kosovo.” And this in turn made a lot of people adopt a particular expression – intrigued, sad. It was well-meant sympathy, but brutal war isn’t the first thing any kid wants other people to think about when they’re saying hello.Lipa sometimes uploads old family photos to her Instagram, and not a few of them show her parents when they first arrived in London. Yikes! There’s a wedding photo that shows Anesa wearing a headdress of flowers and Dukagjin, who in Kosovo had played in a guitar band, with long rock-star hair. This pair absolutely smouldered. Lipa recalls: “Boys at school would say: ‘Your mum’s really hot.’ And the girls would say: ‘Your dad’s so fit.’ Now I find it funny, but as a kid you didn’t want to be different. It made me blush.”From the available evidence on social media, her parents continue to smoulder. They are great senders of heart emojis, patently still besotted with each other. To be the child of a Really Good Couple, I start to say to Lipa… That can have its own difficulties. Especially if it puts a fixed idea in your head of what love should look\u0026nbsplike.Lipa was 11 when her parents sat her down at the kitchen table with big news. Dukagjin had graduated from his studies and been offered a job in the Kosovan capital, Pristina. Lipa was at the end of primary school. “My best friends were all going to different schools. And I told them, ‘Um, I’m going to Kosovo.’”How did you feel?“I was excited. We always spoke Albanian at home. I had my cousins in Kosovo that I’d never met.”And when you got there?“It was absolutely mortifying. Going into a classroom… I remember my first science lesson. They were so far ahead, in terms of mathematics and science. I got such bad grades, especially in the first six months. I could speak the language, but I couldn’t read or write in it.”There was a lot she loved about Pristina. Living there helped Lipa understand she wasn’t just a Londoner, as she’d always thought – that instead she “came from two places”. In musical terms, it was in Pristina that she first got into American hip-hop. Snoop Dogg and Method Man toured through, and these were Lipa’s first gigs. The experience planted in her a love for rap that sat alongside her established obsession with bright, brash pop: Pink, Nelly Furtado, Katy Perry. Lipa knew she could sing. Sometimes, in private, she tried mashing together the two influences, putting a deep, drawled, sung-rap spin on her bedroom renditions of Christina Aguilera. She hoped for some formal training and when Lipa was about 14 she sat down with her parents for another kitchen-table conference.Me, says Lipa. “I didn’t think I’d be able to do this on a global scale, living in Kosovo.”You weren’t telling yourself that at 14…OK. But you weren’t telling your parents that at 14…Lipa smiles: yes and no. She came up with “a trick”, she says, selling her parents on the idea that her main goal was to go to a good, British university. “I said: ‘To do that I’ll need to do my GCSEs and A-levels in English.’” It worked, and they agreed. Back in London, Lipa was looked after by friends of her parents. She did enrol at Sylvia Young on weekends, and began recording demos that she uploaded to YouTube and SoundCloud.As well as trying to be noticed as a musician, Lipa started a fashion blog. Sweetly titled – “Dua Daily” – this started as a sixth-former’s hobby and was maintained pretty thoroughly for two or three years at the end of her teens. Parts still exist online (Lipa’s voice squeaks when I mention it: “Is it online somewhere? That’s so funny”) and as a document it’s intriguing, charting a young woman’s evolution from wide-eyed kid to a professional London scenester, musing on “how important networking is”. We see her try some modelling, try some acting (at one point in an X Factor ad). For the most part she was forthcoming during this period. Networking, and networking some more, always pushing on anybody in music the links to her demos.Eventually Ben Mawson, Lana Del Rey’s manager, had a listen. He signed Lipa, and started arranging long, immersive studio sessions with different collaborators. (The blog: “I am now currently on a gap year and plan to focus full time on my extra curricular activities. And by that I mean music!”) Client and manager were waiting to hear something that excited them. And the best stuff, tonally, seemed to happen when Lipa’s two preferred genres – moody rap and catchy bubblegum – came crunching together. New Rules was actually written for and rejected by a number of other artists, including the girl band Little Mix. When Lipa tried the track she infused it with something new, a battle-weary languor that made it a timely anthem of millennial ennui. One and a half billion clicks later New Rules remains her calling card, her name-maker. At the Brits in February her performance of the song was the evening’s highlight.She had been nominated in five categories on the night. New Rules was up for best single, and her million-selling debut album, Dua Lipa, was up for best album. In the end she won twice, as best female solo artist and British breakthrough act, which meant two trips to stage\u0026nbspand two very different\u0026nbspspeeches.The first was political. “Here’s to more women on these stages,” Lipa said, “more women winning awards, and more women taking over the world.” Thinking back on this, Lipa tells me it hadn’t gone unnoticed by her that she was the only woman nominated in a number of those other, nominally multi-gender categories… “I felt it was really important to touch on the fact that I’ve always been inspired by women and they were the reason I was stood on that\u0026nbspstage.”Her second speech of the night was softer, wispier – a “chase your dreamsmagic is real” bromide that I now find hard to square with the punchy realist I’ve been taking to all morning. Lipa, not so long ago, was able to step out of the pop bubble and tell a fan: get a grip. Can she really believe in all that dream-chasey, magic-can-happen stuff?Lipa listens to this and says sure. But what she learned from her family’s experience was that you keep going, you keep working, you try to better your chances of better luck. “A big part of who I am,” she says, “has been watching my parents learn to adapt in different places, in different circumstances… And my dad would always tell me: ‘You have to work really, really hard, just to have a tiny bit of luck.’ So to answer your question, I do believe in the romantic side of it. And I believe in the hard graft, too.”She opens her hands: the lumberjack palms.“For me, growing up, doing music, watching pop stars on TV – that felt as crazy as cartoons. Totally unbelievable. Not real. What I’ve learned from my parents is this: everything comes from hard work. And then, maybe, things align.”Dua Lipa is on tour now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/390c7b1a691c50490f975dcc0a42feff6d06f310/0_0_3608_2164/master/3608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=787af488231dd2f257d77c469b588905 1240w","title":"mark knopfler skips dire straits rock hall of fame induction","story":"British rockers Dire Straits have been inducted into the rock’n’roll hall of fame, but the occasion was marked without its lead singer and guitarist Mark Knopfler, who chose not to turn up to the ceremony.Knopfler skipped the concert in Cleveland, US, on Saturday, and it was left to bassist John Illsley to explain his absence.“I’ll assure you it’s a personal thing,” Illsley said onstage. “Let’s just leave it at that.”In an earlier interview with Billboard, Illsey said of Knopfler: “He just didn’t feel like coming, it’s as simple as that. It just didn’t appeal to him, and I appealed to him on several occasions.”On Saturday, Illsley acknowledged the awkwardness of Knopfler not being present and then took a subtle swipe at his close friend by saying, “it’s more than one person, a collective”. The band did not perform after speaking.Illsley did compliment Knopfler for writing music that made the band – who had a string of hits in 1970s and 80s, including Sultans Of Swing and Money For Nothing – “stand out from the crowd”.Former Bon Jovi members Richie Sambora and Alec John Such joined current members, including Jon Bon Jovi, onstage to mark the band’s induction into the prestigious club. They performed crowd favourites Livin’ on a Prayer, You Give Love a Bad Name and It’s My Life.The 33rd annual Rock Hall ceremony kicked off with a tribute to Tom Petty, who died in October at age 66.

The notices – requiring organisations to provide the ICO with specified information within a certain time period – were issued in the same week as the ICO conducted raids last month on Cambridge Analytica’s offices. The notices are both part of Operation Cederburg – the commissioner’s year-long investigation into the use of data in the EU referendum. Failure to comply is a criminal offence.Banks – who was by far the biggest funder of Brexit, providing £8.4m in donations and loans – confirmed on Friday that both he personally and Leave.EU had received “information notices”. In an email on Friday, Banks said they were “responding to it’” He said the ICO’s action was not an “investigation” but “an information request”.In a separate development, the Observer has obtained an invoice that Cambridge Analytica issued on 14 December 2015 for £41,500 for work it undertook on behalf of Ukip. The invoice says the payment is for “analysis of Ukip membership and survey data and creative product development”, and it is issued on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC, the American entity, from its office in Alexandria, Virginia. This is the first documentary evidence that Cambridge Analytica did conduct analytics work on behalf of one of the Leave campaigns in the period before the referendum.Banks confirmed to the Observer that he was also sent the invoice at that time too. He said he subsequently made a donation for the amount to cover the invoice to Ukip. A spokesman for Ukip, speaking to the Guardian last month, denied any payment for the work was made but he confirmed Banks had in fact made the donation after “new information had come to light”. He said that the party decided not to pass on the money to Cambridge Analytica.Banks has long denied that Cambridge Analytica did any work for Leave.EU, as has Cambridge Analytica. The question is still the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Electoral Commission. In a written submission to the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) last month, Banks said he had met Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica but that he had declined to take him up on his proposal. Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it “did some preliminary analysis as part of a proposal to work with Ukip, but no contract was agreed, payment was not made to CA, and the preliminary work was not delivered to Ukip.”Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica director, who appeared on a panel at Leave.EU’s launch event, came forward to the Guardian last month and raised further questions about these claims. She said the company had completed around £40,000 worth of work for Ukip, using Ukip data, but agreed that the company had not been paid. She is expected to talk about this on Tuesday when she will testify to parliament as part of the DCMS committee into fake news.He also confirmed that the party had handed over its database of roughly 40,000 supporters to Cambridge Analytica despite denying this to the Guardian last month.Ukip had told the Guardian previously that Cambridge Analytica “saw” the data but a spokesman admitted the information – including telephone numbers, email addresses, ages, and other personal information among other things – was given to the company on a computer as part of what he described as “preparatory work”.The spokesman said: “I asked everyone about this work and I was told CA pitched for it, Banks didn’t like it and he’d refused to pay for it. It’s now come out that he did actually make a donation to cover the cost of the work. But we never actually handed it over.”The revelations raise a whole new set of questions about how the referendum was funded and whether strict rules on spending may have been broken. The Observer has seen evidence which suggests that a form of the Ukip data that Cambridge Analytica analysed and processed was passed to iniduals in the Leave.EU campaign. And a donation of £42,000 from Better for the Country, Leave.EU’s registered company name, was recorded as a political donation to the party on the Electoral Commission’s site one week before the referendum on 16 June 2016. It was not registered as part of the campaign by either entity as a referendum donation or expense.The unfolding of the Cambridge Analytica scandal has coincided with the final stages of the information commissioner’s investigation into the use of data in the referendum. Leave.EU’s operation has become one focus of the year-long investigation. Another resulted in the ICO’s raid on Cambridge Analytica. Damian Collins, the Tory MP for Folkestone, who is the chair of the DCMS committee, has told the Observer that both Britain’s electoral and data laws needed a radical and urgent overhaul. He said it was “ridiculous” that the ICO had to wait five days before being able to get a warrant to seize Cambridge Analytica’s computer servers and equipment.Separately, the ICO investigation is believed to be trying to understand the relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance Services, the Bristol-based insurance company that Banks owns and that was the HQ for Leave.EU referendum campaign work. A spokesman said: “Leave.EU and Eldon have never shared any data. And Leave.EU has never shared any data with Cambridge Analytica whether in relation to the EU referendum or otherwise.”The ICO may be asking questions because of previous comments Banks has made, including in an interview a year ago with the Observer. When asked about the use of Leave.EU’s database to send advertisements about his insurance products to campaign supporters, Banks said: “Why shouldn’t I? It’s my data.” When asked again last week, he said: “Leave.EU after the referendum campaign carried the occasional ad for insurance, so what?”In an email on Friday he said: “Eldon has never given or used any data to Leave.EU. They are separate entities with strong data control rules. And vice versa.” He added: “Make any mistakes relating to the business and we will be most assuredly coming after the Guardian \u0026amp you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1d52fd783fc7208c12065a125216ff7f27c10c2/0_413_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e798d2e166ba73118a22f5b70eb32f23 2600w","title":"wandsworth council labour targets thatcher favourite tory control four decades","story":"Activists say they have real chance of taking control of council that has been Tory for four decadesHalf a mile from where Sadiq Khan grew up on the Henry Prince estate in Wandsworth, a small gaggle of Labour activists are gathering in Earlsfield, with the real prospect of taking back a council that has been Conservative since the London mayor was at primary school.Wandsworth, famously Margaret Thatcher’s favourite borough, has been a flagship Tory council for 40 years, pioneering the outsourcing of local services and famous for its ultra-low council tax.Labour campaigners have been buoyed by June 2016’s general election result, in which Labour ousted the Tory minister Jane Ellison in Battersea and slashed the majority of the then-cabinet minister Justine Greening in Putney. Housing is on the mind of many voters, said the MP for Tooting, Rosena Allin-Khan, out with the canvassers in Earlsfield where the ward is held by two Tory councillors and one Labour.“Housing is something that affects everyone, regardless of age or socioeconomic status, in council homes, renting or worrying about whether your children can ever afford to buy in the same area,” she said.One emblem is the controversial development of the former Battersea power station. Labour has said it would review the planning applications from developers in order to force them to reinstate plans for more affordable flats, controversially slashed last year with Wandsworth council’s approval.Simon Hogg, the Labour leader on the council, said the sight of the development was causing feelings of resentment. “People can see a big tower block going up and yet know none of their friends, or their children, are going to get to live there,” he said.The housing crisis had created some of the conditions for a possible Labour victory, Hogg said. “Wandsworth Tories aggressively sold off thousands of council homes to create this very large private rented sector, believing that would be a huge electoral advantage to them,” he said. “These are the renters who elected Marsha de Cordova in Battersea and gave Rosena such a big majority in Tooting.”However, it is the Tories’ low council tax pledge that is the key appeal to most voters. It still remains the second cheapest in the country at £716.51 a year for a band D property and estate agents use it to advertise their listings.Jo Rigby, who is standing in Earlsfield, admitted the low council tax message “does work, especially when people move into the area ... but what we are increasingly hearing is that, we would rather pay more and get better services”.If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you.

One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.Labour has said it would freeze council tax for the next two years. But John Locker, a newly elected Tory councillor who won his Thamesfield seat in a November byelection, said voters were sceptical. “I don’t think we understand how Labour can square that circle of extra spending now but not taxing more,” he said. “I want to improve Wandsworth, but in order to do that we have to manage our residents’ council tax money.”Locker’s victory was a boost for the Conservatives. He won his Putney seat at a low point for the Tories, after a difficult party conference for Theresa May, resignations of cabinet ministers and a tough Brexit negotiation, and amid a blitz of Labour activism.“Angela Rayner, Chris Williamson and lots of other Labour MPs came, there were hundreds of Momentum activists, but it didn’t work for them and we held the seat quite comfortably,” he said. Labour holds 19 seats and looks like it will make comfortable headway into the mid-20s, but the maths looks more difficult to get a majority. It would mean taking some of the most affluent wards in the country, where Labour councillors have not been elected since the 1960s.The former Tory MP Richard Tracey, latterly Wandsworth’s London assembly member, said incumbency was a key strength. “Statistically, Labour is strong in five wards, they have a lot of votes in a small number of wards. They will have to fight very hard in wards they don’t hold – it’s a high hill to climb.”Locker said Labour may have talked itself into a corner. “I do think the pressure is on Labour given how they have talked up Wandsworth as a crown jewel, winning this iconic council. I personally would never take voters of Wandsworth for granted. We have a strong manifesto on keeping council tax low, affordable housing, keeping weekly bin collections, things that really matter to local people.”Allin-Khan said in those seats where Labour needed steep numbers to win, the most crucial final hurdle would be getting Labour voters to the polls. “We’ll be piggy-backing people to the polling stations at 9.59pm.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c11a438df90db330832f2c35c0617a7e9fd71a71/0_549_8348_5009/master/8348.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=310650b99a3816ddf7f1ff9d7aa4357f 1240w","title":"janet mock id never seen a young trans woman who was thriving in the world i was looking for that","story":"The 35-year-old activist and bestselling author tells her remarkable story – and explains why she’s working on a new drama about trans women of colour that will be nothing like TransparentJanet Mock is talking so fast I can’t keep up. One moment we are in Hawaii and she is living, desperately uncomfortably, as a little boy called Charles. The next she is 10 years old and has created the alter ego Keisha to enable her to talk to boys on the phone. Then she is living happily as a transgender girl, a star pupil and captain of the school volleyball team.

Specifically my trans-ness. I had to pretend I was any other 21-year-old. Most of them had not transitioned or had to work the streets or in a strip club, and most of them were not already married.

And I’m excited because this is a new space in my career.”Her sentences are regularly punctuated with the word “space”, perhaps not surprisingly for somebody who has had to fight so hard to claim hers.Mock is fastidiously polite. At times, she sounds like an old-fashioned southern belle dreamed up by Tennessee Williams. In fact, she grew up impoverished in Honolulu. Her father, Charlie, is African-American and was a drug addict (she had no idea and was devastated to discover when she was young that neighbours knew him as “Charlie the crackhead”). Her mother, Elizabeth, is Hawaiian. The family was broken and dysfunctional, but loving in its own chaotic way. As a seven-year-old, Mock went to live with her father in Oakwood, California. Her father called young Charles a sissy. Mock says she was called all sorts when she was growing up – freak, faggot, tranny, the N-word.She did not see her mother for five years until, at the age of 12, she returned to Honolulu, where she flourished. Her mother never discouraged her from becoming Janet (a name she chose after a friend told her she looked like Janet Jackson). “There were bigger issues in our family. My mom didn’t have the luxury of time and resources to micromanage any of her children’s lives.” It was a blessing, she says – wealthier parents might have paid for therapy to “right” her.Mock was helped by the fact that gender is relatively fluid in Hawaii. The word “māhū” denotes a third gender. It is a pejorative for gay men and drag queens, but it can also have a sense of the sacred attached to it.“My mom, growing up in Hawaii, saw trans people existing every day. She didn’t know they were trans. She was just like: ‘Oh, that’s such-and-such who lives on the street.’ It was the norm to have people who were not male or female people who may be in the middle somewhere.”Mock, now 35, splits her time between Los Angeles and New York. We meet for lunch at a stately hotel in West Hollywood. Mock is gorgeous – tall, curvy, with brown, almond-shaped eyes, a perfect smile and cheek-bones so high you could hoist a flag on them. Despite her sing-song voice, she is fierce and forensic in her arguments.She orders a super-strong cold brew (coffee brewed for hours in cold water) and a steak dish and we return to her past. At 15, she began hormone treatment without telling her mother. Soon after, she started selling sex and stripping to pay for her $7,000 (£5,700) surgery. The only thing she regrets, she says, is doing a\u0026nbspporn shoot to earn the final $1,500. “The sex work was private, but this was on record for the rest of my life.” In her first memoir, Redefining Realness, she wrote that she was “immortalising the one part of my\u0026nbspbody that brought me so much\u0026nbspanguish”.I ask when she started thinking of herself as Janet and she says it is a false premise she always thought of herself as a girl who was cursed by biology. She knew she wanted sex-reassignment surgery, but that was not going to determine her gender. “I believed I was, and knew myself as, a young woman, even when I had a penis. It wasn’t as if I needed the surgery to confirm that for me.”Was there any point at which she felt she could be complete without surgery? “I did not, but that’s just my experience. I know a lot of people who do, and that’s where the burden of representation comes in. I’m sitting here telling my specific story, but though I wasn’t comfortable with that, there are thousands of people who are, or thousands who don’t have access to the funds to have surgery.”Mock often talks about the burden of representation. She might be regarded as a spokeswoman for trans women, but she does not pretend her experience is representative. For one thing, she was fortunate enough to be able to choose whether to disclose she was trans. Many trans women do not have that privilege – their appearance gives them away.She has said that without her smile and her MA in journalism, nobody would have listened to her. “The ‘pretty privilege’ can give you access to spaces, just like your able body gives you access. But it makes impossible beauty standards for many other trans girls who are struggling with that right now.”She argues that trans women obsess too much about being able to “pass”, but she knows it is easy for her to say. She, too, obsessed about that in the past – ironically, one of the things she found validating was one of the things she most despised: men objectifying her.She drains her cool brew, and our main course arrives – steak, brown rice, vegetables. “Oh, my God! This looks really good.” She examines one of the vegetables curiously, and calls over Wayne, the waiter.“Wayne, is this like a sweet potato?”She has a way of engaging with people and dismissing them with self-assured charm.Mock says so much has changed in the trans world since she was young. She hopes few people today need to go to the lengths she did to fund surgery. Would she swap her story for a more sober version? “No. I would have my story,” she says instantly. Is there any time she would have swapped it ? “When I was living it yeah. Che-che-che-che!” She laughs loudly and uninhibitedly, as if clearing her throat. “I wanted a genie to pop up and grant me three wishes – to get all this over with, to have a financial safety net and to be comfortable. But I wouldn’t take anything from my experience because it built my resolve my core.\u0026nbspI fought for every single thing I\u0026nbsphave now.”Actually, Mock says, there was a great support network among sex workers. “The girls felt safe there. We took care of each other. You showed up, you knew who was there and how long she’s gone. We weren’t doing it in isolation. Now sex work had gone online so you’re by yourself all the time.”When she left Hawaii for New York, three years after surgery, Mock chose not to reveal that she was trans. She embarked on a new life experience, described in her second memoir Surpassing Certainty. “If I had disclosed, it would have made people judge me, made them not want to be with me, made me an object, a freak show. I would have been the trans girl in the room. To reveal to a class of strangers the heaviness of my past was just too much. It’s inconvenient. The inconvenient truth! And I didn’t want to be inconvenienced. It would get in the way. I just wanted to go to school to get a job, and move on.”She felt both freed and imprisoned. “The secrecy was hard to cope with,” she says. Mock also became aware of her blackness in a way she had never been before. In Hawaii, she was primarily identified as trans and “everybody was at least brown or tinted in some way”. At New York University, she was one of a handful of black students. “So, in Zora Neale Hurston’s words, I was thrust against a white backdrop.” She pauses. “I love Zora. She is THE\u0026nbspQueen!”Her progress in the publishing world was seamless. Before long, she was an editor and writer at People magazine. But she became bored. She realised she had a better story to tell than the celebrities she was interviewing. And she wanted to own that story. In 2009, she met photographer Aaron Tredwell, who was to become her second husband. “I started telling the people in my life and I was like: ‘Oh, this story is interesting because I’ve never seen it before. This is pre-Orange Is the New Black, pre-Caitlyn Jenner.’ And I was like: ‘I think I should tell my story.’ I’d never seen a young trans woman who was living and thriving in the world, and I was looking for that.”Throughout the Obama years, she says, transgender rights improved considerably in the US, but now Donald Trump is determined to reverse that progress. Last July, he attempted to introduce a blanket ban on transgender people joining the military.“There is a lot of rowing back on protections that the Obama administration put through: the guidelines for trans children in schools trans-specific affordable healthcare the military ban.” She says it is part of a wider general clampdown on rights for minorities.Trans women have been questioned from more than one side of the political spectrum. What does Mock make of the continuing opposition from some feminists?“I think it is rooted in the same thing they say they’re fighting against – biological essentialism. So, it’s saying that if you don’t have these specific biological experiences as a woman you cannot be a woman, you cannot be in our struggle. I would argue that for women to say the only identifying factor of a woman is a pussy is misogynistic. If we’re saying that to be a feminist is to eliminate barriers and alleviate marginalisation based on gender, then how could you not want to include the persecuted trans women\u0026nbspor non-binary folk so you have more comrades to fight against gendered oppression?”She looks me in the face. “My grandmother gets who I am, so when you ask me about people who don’t understand, or people who are on their bully pulpits saying you shouldn’t accept people, I’m like: “What’s happened to you that, of all the things you can talk about, of all the injustices in the world, the one thing you want to concentrate on is trans people living their truth? How is that harming you and your identity? How I identify has nothing to do with you, and how you identify has nothing to do with me. Right? So live your life and let me live mine.”She chews on her steak, decisively. I hope that is not directed at me, I say, cowering. She stops in her tracks and bursts out laughing. “Che-che-che-che. Nonononoo.”Mock has spent much of the past year as part of the writingproducing team on Pose, the new trans drama devised by Glee creator Ryan Murphy. She is also directing one episode. I ask her what she thinks of Transparent, the US comedy-drama about a middle-aged father who becomes a trans woman.“I don’t watch it, so I don’t know,” she says.But it is one of the few dramas featuring trans characters, I insist.“It was never really for me. Just because there’s a trans character doesn’t mean it’s a show I would watch.”But I persist. Surely, if you are making a drama about trans people, you would want to watch what has gone before. “You’re really stuck on\u0026nbspthis Transparent thing, which is interesting to me,” Mock says, smiling. But, now, it is a hollow smile.She quietly but firmly puts me in my place. “It’s about somebody way older than me, who was a professor. Transparent is about a white, middle-class, liberal family, so there\u0026nbspare no intersections that interest me.”What makes her so excited about Pose is that it is about the very people she knows and cares about. “Our show is centring on trans women of colour in a way they’ve not been centred on ever. What’s so radical to me is that, unlike Transparent, where there is one main character who is trans and played by a man, we have five main characters who are trans played by trans women. That five black and brown trans women will be the centre of a show on a network drama in primetime is huge. And they’re going to be on billboards. It’s\u0026nbspamazing this is going to exist in the world.”I tell Mock I have one final question, from a trans friend of my elder daughter. She asked: “How can a nice trans girl like me find the perfect husband like Aaron,” I say.Mock roars with delight. “That is so sweet! What is her name?” Charlie, I say.“To be in a relationship is an incredibly vulnerable space to be in, so you have to be willing to be open, to not be afraid of that intense gaze on you. Aaron was intense he really wanted to know me. And I chose to show up as myself, and I chose to be vulnerable and tell him my story, and that has been the foundation of our relationship. We’re going to challenge one another by telling the truth to one another, then be strong enough to stick around when that truth is not exactly what we thought we were going to hear. I hope that helps Charlie.”I’m sure it will, I tell her, and\u0026nbspexplain that Charlie is also an\u0026nbspactivist.“What is her second name?” Charlie Craggs, I say.“Oh, I know that name,” she whoops. “I’m not kidding. I follow her on Twitter.” Within seconds, she is searching her Twitter account. “Craggs? Cr … Cra … See, I told you,” she shouts, triumphantly.Two cold brews down, and having just discovered Charlie, she is talking faster than ever. “I love that! It’s a small world. Shows how deeply connected we are! Che-che-che-che.”This is who she has written her books for, she says – the next generation. Mock says she has done her bit: she can now go off and write screenplays and be a boring old binary trans woman. It is up to people like Charlie to take up the cudgels. “There are trans girls who are still navigating these spaces and wanting to learn and grow and they need something fun to look at when they see themselves. They don’t just need to know the tragedy and trauma of being trans. They also need to know how to better be, how to better live, how to better dream.”Surpassing Certainty, Mock’s memoir will be published worldwide on 1 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3afb528eb1ea230cf167b62929c43845457987c4/1822_377_2542_1526/master/2542.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=956f203accf85c6946eb2ec835ce56dd 1240w","title":"commonwealth games the gold coast performances that didnt go to plan","story":"If you are going to have winner, inevitably it means there will be losers. Here are a few of the people who would probably rather forget their time at the 2018 Commonwealth GamesAs the closing ceremony bought the curtain down on 11 days of Commonwealth Games sport at Gold Coast, there were plenty of memories of sporting highlights. And also, a few things that organiser, broadcasters and athletes might rather forget. Here are a few of the things that didn’t go quite so well in Australia...New Zealand’s Elizabeth Cui made a splash of the wrong kind in the women’s 1m springboard preliminary round. The five-time national champion got her e completely wrong, and ended up flopping into the pool on her back, earning her a mark of zero from every judge.But Cui wasn’t the only person to have number trouble during the ing - the judges themselves fell victim to a glitch on the Games’ technical systems, and started the tournament having to mark ers using the back-up system of holding up number cards.One athlete who got excluded from the Games through no fault of her own was English cyclist Melissa Lowther. She was all set to compete in the cycling time trial, but an unticked box on an administrative form meant the authorities excluded her from the start list. Lowther posted on Instagram to express her intense disappointment. There was an early bath for BBC Breakfast presenter Mike Bushell, who contrived to miss a step and fall into a swimming pool while live on air interviewing England Commonwealth Games swimmers Sarah Vasey, Adam Peaty, Siobhan-Marie O’Connor, Ben Proud and James Guy. A regular trope of Olympic Games coverage is about the number of condoms given away for free in the athlete’s village in the expectation that there will be a lot of hook-ups. And there were some red faces among athletes at the Games after some of their postings on Tinder were exposed. Athletes like South African hockey player Nqobile Ntuli were spotted on the dating app, looking “to meet some wild troopers while I am down here”, while Australian swimmer Taylor Mckeown was spotted on the site posing with her silver medal from the 2016 Rio Olympics. Zharnel Hughes found out on his lap of honour that he had been disqualified from the 200m final for impeding Trinidad’s Jereem Richards on the line. He redeemed himself by being part of England’s gold-medal winning 4x100m relay team, but will always look back on what might have been double gold on the Gold Coast track.Organisers were severely criticised after Scotland’s Callum Hawkins collapsed in the closing stages of the men’s marathon on Sunday. Leading by two minutes with less than two miles to go, Hawkins stumbled and appeared to hit his head on the kerbside as he fell.Mark Peters, Gold Coast 2018 chief executive said that assistance had been provided “within agreed response guidelines and timeframes” and expressed concern about bystanders taking photos of the prone athlete rather than assisting. The BBC’s Steve Cram described the delay in medics reaching Hawkins as “disgraceful”.After months of publicity building the Gold Coast up as a wonderful destination for sun, sea and surfing, the worldwide TV audience for the Games’ opening ceremony watched the heavens open and soak the dignitaries and performers as well as the athletes taking part in the opening parade. There was also a nationwide debate in Australia as to what had happened to Borobi - the blue koala mascot - who didn’t appear to feature at all during the opening ceremony, to the extent that organisers had to make a statement about his whereabouts, the hasthag #whereisborobi began, and somebody even set up a parody account to answer them all on Twitter.Organisers had to apologise for printing 15,000 tickets for the opening ceremony with the wrong date on them - and that wasn’t even the only printing error. The late entrance of the Gambia back into the Commonwealth fold left programme-printers embarrassed as the official merchandise for the opening ceremony declared the English capital to be Banjul.At least the opening ceremony was broadly well received, in contrast to the closing ceremony. Athletes had very little role to play in the latter, leading to Australia’s Channel 7 anchors Jo Griggs and Basil Zempilas controversially criticising it on air. “They made decisions not to have athletes enter the stadium” Griggs said. “They made the decision not to show the flag bearers. I’m furious. You want to see the athletes come in. You want to see them jumping in front of camera. You want to see them celebrating 11 days of great sport.”There’s nothing like punching above your weight in sport, and that was true more than ever at this year’s Commonwealth Games for Norfolk Island. They sent a team of 18 athletes from their population of 1,748, meaning that one in every hundred Norfolk Islanders was part of their contingent. Ryan Dixon, Hadyn Evans and Phillip Jones went on to win the bronze in the lawn bowls for the third smallest territory to compete at the Gold Coast. Of teams at the Games, only Gibraltar and Nauru Island are physically smaller than Norfolk Island, and only Niue has a smaller population.

From frustration, unhappiness and even questioning his future in F1 after retirement at the last round in Bahrain, the Australian emerged from a meeting of two halves triumphant and euphoric, having made his mark in the race of the season with emphatic style.Ricciardo’s overtaking was superlative but behind him there was a different picture, with Mercedes’s Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel left licking their wounds after finishing in fourth and eighth respectively.Hamilton was relieved that rather than dropping points to the German he has narrowed the gap in the title battle from 17 to nine points but the first half of the race proved that his team have been put on the back foot by Ferrari, who have the quicker car. Valtteri Bottas was second for Mercedes but they have much work to do.Kimi Räikkönen finished in third for Ferrari but they too face questions after their strategy was found wanting. Vettel had led from pole until the pit stops and Mercedes brought Bottas in first while Vettel stayed out. The Finn put in some very quick sectors going for the undercut and a slow stop for the Scuderia cost Vettel and he emerged in second. The win looked to be in Mercedes’s hands, with Hamilton doing his best at damage limitation having started from fourth.But the real drama was yet to come. The two Toro Rossos clashed at turn 14, leaving debris in their wake, and Red Bull’s reaction to the subsequent safety car was swift and tactically astute. They sent both drivers into the pits and they emerged on new, soft rubber with the pace to hunt down the leaders.Max Verstappen was the leader of the two but he was overambitious making a move on Hamilton and went off, losing his place to Ricciardo. The Australian, who had been in sixth, needed no further encouragement. Hamilton fell with a superb piece of late braking into the hairpin, Vettel on the back straight and then Bottas with a e up the inside of turn four that took the breath away. Ricciardo was magnificent and, out of contract at the end of this year, presented a potent reminder of his talent to Ferrari and Mercedes, who both potentially have seats open next season.Yet it had been so close to another resolution-sapping weekend for the Australian. On Saturday, after an engine problem in practice, he only just made qualifying. The team did superbly to fix it and he made the most of it.“This sport’s crazy,” he said. “A week ago I was with my head down. Frustrated at the sport, frustrated at all the variables. Sometimes I question why I chose this sport because there’s so many things out of your control and it does get you down a lot – but then when you have a day like this it’s worth fifty of those bad ones.”Hamilton was forthright that he had been unable to match Ferrari. “I had no pace and was just trying to hold on,” he said. “Yesterday and today was a disaster on my side.”But the team, too, must consider their part. They opted not to send the British driver to the pits for fresh rubber when Red Bull did and it proved costly. The team principal, Toto Wolff, said they had thought track position was more important. “Looking back, it would have been the right strategy to pit but nobody in the team, including myself, though it was the right thing to do at the time,” he said.Hamilton was not willing to apportion blame. “I just struggled with the car,” he said. “Rather than blaming strategy, I was uncomfortable in the car this weekend. The lack of pace, I have to take it upon myself to figure out.”Vettel’s day, serene at the opening, went downhill from the moment he lost the lead. Verstappen, charging once again after his off, was too hot into the hairpin, locked up and collected the German, causing them both to spin. Vettel dropped places and lost balance in the car, leaving him struggling in seventh, a position he lost to Fernando Alonso on the penultimate lap.Verstappen, facing growing criticism for poor decisions after hitting Hamilton in Bahrain, was penalised and apologised but the damage was done. “In that situation he has to change his style, otherwise it will happen again,” Vettel said. “I said to him afterwards: ‘Look, the race is long and you threw your podium away.’”The German was left ruing what might have been an extended lead in the title race but F1 was able to revel in a thrilling contest with a more than worthy winner. “Sometimes you have just got to lick the stamp and send it,” Ricciardo said colourfully of his move on Hamilton and in doing so posted notice of his intent to be a player in this year’s title fight.Verstappen finished in fourth but was classified fifth after his penalty Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg was in sixth, with his team-mate Carlos Sainz in ninth Alonso in seventh and Kevin Magnussen’s Haas 10th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6929aaead6e7937a322fa4d8cfc1f7738b20936f/0_189_5034_3021/master/5034.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=62f7233d1fdeb021a606dc60fbc03cf3 1240w","title":"marathon greats condemn games organisers over hawkins treatment","story":"Commonwealth Games organisers were heavily criticised for not providing sufficient medical assistance to a Scottish marathon runner who collapsed but was not attended to by paramedics for several minutes.Callum Hawkins was leading the marathon by almost two minutes and was less than two miles from the finish when he collapsed from heat exhaustion in 30 degree heat. The 25-year-old, who finished fourth at the World Championships marathon in London last summer, had looked set for gold but he began to sway in distress and fell over on the curb.He managed to rouse himself and briefly continued but supported himself several times using the metal barriers lining the course. But he collapsed again shortly afterwards, hitting his head on one of the roadside barriers. Hawkins was taken to hospital and is sat up and talking with no obvious long term damage done but fellow athletes and former athletes were damning of how long it took for professional assistance to arrive.Marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe tweeted that there were “big questions” for the local organising committee and medical staff. “That should never happen,” she said.Some spectators even took pictures of a stricken Hawkins with nobody seeming to offer any help. Commentating on the BBC, former middle distance runner Steve Cram said it was “a disgrace” that it took so long for any paramedics to attend to Hawkins.“I’m just concerned for his welfare,” Cram said, “He hit his head on the barrier. I’m sorry if you’re watching this at home, it’s really distressing. He’s going to hurt himself and there’s nobody anywhere near. We should have some more medical attention.” “This is a guy in real distress and someone needs to recognise it for his health at this point. Where on earth is the help? You cannot just wait at the finish line. They’ve got radios. And finally somebody arrives. I think it’s disgraceful.”Mark Peters, Gold Coast 2018 chief executive, said: “I like many others was distressed to see a wonderful athlete like Callum collapse during the closing stages of today’s marathon. We are offering every assistance possible to Callum and Team Scotland.” “Gold Coast 2018 has put in place a wide range of measures to ensure athlete welfare and the response of medical staff this morning was within agreed response guidelines and timeframes. I was also concerned about the behaviour of a small number of bystanders who chose to take images. This is not in keeping with the spirit of Gold Coast 2018.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008c6905d9cb4a1557484118541fd1ad30fe0e52/63_93_4535_2722/master/4535.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3d2fb86ab405d8858084dc33b21c00bc 1240w","title":"saracens bath premiership match report","story":"• Saracens 41-6 Bath• Jonathan Joseph’s England tour place in jeopardyAnother desperate afternoon for Bath, and not a great one for England with Jonathan Joseph hobbling off with an ankle injury that may jeopardise his place on the summer tour of South\u0026nbspAfrica.For Saracens it was an emphatic bonus-point victory, confirming their place in the play-offs for the ninth season in a row, but the contrast between their resurgence and Bath’s bleak slump could not be more stark.The Bath director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, was hopeful over Joseph but he needed crutches to take his place on the bench after going off in the first half and he will be assessed in the coming days. “He’s given his ankle a really good tweak,” Blackadder said. “Hopefully it won’t be too serious.”Certainly, it is another blow for Bath in a season full of them. They are already without the England trio of Anthony Watson, Semesa Rokoduguni and Sam Underhill and a fourth successive defeat leaves them in eighth and staring down the barrel of Challenge Cup rugby next season.All told it has been a thoroughly frustrating campaign and Blackadder’s job must surely be in danger considering the directors of rugby in the four teams below Bath have all headed, or are heading, for the exit. “If somebody wants to make those decisions, it’s not something that I can control,” he said.It was not as if Bath did not show glimpses of quality but they were given an abject lesson in finishing by a Saracens side who are coming to the boil nicely. Both of their first-half tries had elements of fortune to them, however, or rather misfortune for Bath. A loose pass from Francois Louw eventually led to Schalk Brits’s try, via three penalties kicked to the corner.Owen Farrell converted and it was his covering tackle that indirectly led to Liam Williams’s try. Aled Brew burst down the left but really ought to have passed to Ben Tapuai outside him. When Bath recycled, Rhys Priestland’s pass struck the unaware Louw on his side, Nick Isiekwe gathered the loose ball and fed Williams to run nearly the length of the field.Isiekwe’s most eye-catching contribution was still to come. Taulupe Faletau showed his class with a scything break up the left and a delightful offload inside to Brew. He went back outside to Kahn Fotuali’i who looked certain to score until Isiekwe’s last-ditch tackle dragged him out of play – an intervention every bit as impressive as Underhill’s for England against Wales.Two Priestland penalties had at least got Bath on the board but Farrell nailed one of his own into the wind just before half-time and with the conditions in their favour in the second half Saracens raced through the gears. Richard Wigglesworth went over in the right-hand corner before Farrell picked off a loose pass from Priestland and cruised over to seal the bonus point.Schalk Burger and Ben Spencer were on hand for tries five and six while Saracens were able to welcome back Michael Rhodes off the bench after an injury lay-off since January. In truth, they had far too much firepower for Bath and you have to wonder why Mako Vunipola played when he was due a rest according to an agreement between the Premiership and the Rugby Football Union. He was excellent again but you get the feeling Saracens would have been fine without him.He and the rest of the squad do at least have a week off now, and they are then set to have Billy Vunipola back at their disposal for the run-in. Exeter are setting the pace but Saracens are going to take some stopping. “There’s real determination to finish the season well,” the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, said. “We’re in a good position, we seem to be getting people healthy at the right time as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cff0a5e927d59734fcffa8a8246b367ced5c3d2/0_0_3223_2188/master/3223.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef6552d4d27347ebe611a2ae471df9c1 700w","title":"josie long and jonny donahoe having a baby","story":"Just a month before their first child is due, the standup couple are doing a show together – seeking the audience’s parenting tips“It’s mad,” says Josie Long, “but it feels like the right thing to do.” Braving the blustery weather at a pavement cafe near their east London home, Long and fellow comedian Jonny Donahoe are discussing their unlikely new project, which enjoys its first and only UK performance next week.

I thought it’d be such a beautiful thing, and I’d tour it loads, then we’d start trying for a baby, and I’d feel in a really good place.” Instead, the couple found themselves unexpectedly expecting on the back of few “tricky” years, as Long describes them, when she’d been ill and “not writing as much as I’d like”.“So we’re in a position of uncertainty and unpreparedness,” she says. “We’re excited and happy, but it’s frightening and unusual too. That’s where the show comes from. We wanted to have fun with that – and to ask advice from people who are parents too.” They staged an early version in Brooklyn in March, with Daily Show contributor – and parent – John Hodgman as special guest. (In London, it’s Christie.) They posed fretful questions like: “What happens if you lose the kid?” Hodgman and the audience supplied soothing counsel in response.And in return for the advice, what will their show (and the podcast that may follow) offer audiences? Having read “lots of bad books on the subject”, in Donahoe’s words, the pair aim to puncture some of what Long calls the “unhelpful, unscientific or deep-rooted in sexist bullshit” myths surrounding pregnancy. “To do a show,” she continues, “about becoming parents from – what I now realise is – our unconventional perspective. We want to coparent and we’re aware of how unusual that is.” Their job helps with this aspiration. “As comedians, we’re quite time-rich,” Donahoe says. “We can both take time off. Standup is a very flexible job.” “And also,” Long adds, “we’re both very open in our work and like to talk about what’s happening in our lives.” On the ethics of making their pregnancy public property, she admits “it’s really tricky. As comedians you want to share – but you want to share what you want to share. And there will always be people who cross the boundary in the wrong way.” Last month, in what became a comedy cause celebre, standup Louise Reay was sued by her ex-husband for breach of privacy. But “I’m not going to sue you,” Jonny promises Josie. “What would I get if I sued you? I haven’t even paid you back for half the sofa.”Long admits to anxieties, too, about how parenthood may affect her career in a still-sexist industry. “I miss having my brain being my own,” she confesses. “And I hope that once we’ve had our little maternity period I can write another show, tour it, and we can travel as a family.” Finally, that prospect – of new adventures, new horizons – eclipses any anxiety. “I’ve been writing shows that say, ‘I feel like I’m not growing up enough’ – and I don’t want to do that for ever. I want to write shows that say, ‘This is what life is like for me now,’ that tackle the world in a new way. So I’m really up for it. I think having a baby will change our perspective and be difficult and new and unusual. And I embrace all of that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Its presenter, Will Millard, an upbeat writer and expedition leader who seems cut from the cloth of 90s Jamie Oliver, sets out to West Papua in Indonesia to document the holy grail sought by many anthropological documentary-makers – a society untouched by the modern world. Millard has visited the region many times before and speaks Indonesian, but he has yet to meet the remote Korowai people. So, he heads into the rainforest without any fixed plans, in the hope that a “traditional” family will let him film with them for a sustained period. “I want to try something different,” he explains, aware that this has been attempted before, offering four visits over the course of a year as his USP.The twist has been revealed in advance and picked over in the papers already. The Korowai are not as remote a tribe as they once were. They have smartphones, generators and a school. Many of their famous treehouses, built high off the rainforest floor, were constructed for the benefit of previous documentaries, including the BBC’s 2011 series Human Planet. With a growing sense of confusion and disappointment, Millard realises he is being performed to by the people he meets. First, there is Markus, who assumes the role of a treehouse-dweller, but it soon becomes clear that this is a show for the cameras. Markus has a list of prices for “activities”, from hunting for grubs to cooking rat. He sings as he is cooking a meal: “We weren’t like this before.”But Markus is not the only one in on this presentation of tribe life. In the end, we are left with the shell of the documentary that Millard thought he was going to make, propped up by an existential crisis about authenticity, artifice and encroaching modernity.As fascinating as that is, it left me uneasy. Much of the first episode seems more concerned with Millard’s feelings about his thwarted adventure than with the people who have intrigued him for so long. That may be a result of necessity. Once it becomes clear that the Korowai have seen wide-eyed film crews plenty of times before, the focus of the documentary becomes documentary-making. It turns into an ethical quagmire and I am not sure that My Year With the Tribe escapes from it simply by addressing that fact.There is a paradox in Millard’s despair. He seems frustrated that a cash economy, which he puts down to outside visitors, has changed what he had hoped to find. There is some agonised self-flagellation about being part of the problem – “Look around you, mate, you made this” – but he remains determined to be the person to find the remote tribe that has eluded him, in spite of the fact that the search for it turns into “a bit of a disaster” in places, as he admits. Having seen the effects of documentaries such as this being made again and again, he continues to attempt to make one. Perhaps this will be addressed in the remaining two episodes, but something about this jarringly frank series makes me wonder if it will be the last of its kind – and whether that would be such a bad thing.After a well-received pilot, the sketch show Famalam (BBC Two) has been given a four-episode series, first shown online on BBC Three. It is good-natured, daft and occasionally incisive, with its initial sketch laying out its wry wit to particularly sharp effect: a black superhero takes out a gang of drug dealers and stands, triumphantly and expectantly, as the police arrive on the scene. Cut to him being thrown across the bonnet of the car, in cuffs, as “suspect: black male” crackles across the radio and the dealers are handed hot chocolate and blankets.Plenty has been written about how sketch comedy has been revived by the internet’s appetite for brief, shareable clips (one of the stars of Famalam, Tom Moutchi, made his name on Vine) and this certainly feels as if it could exist in isolated, Facebook-friendly bursts. The sketches are rapid-fire and rarely outstay their welcome. Some, like the gag about racist swiping on dating apps, are one-note jokes that pass in a flash. Others, such as the Blaxploitation-flecked countryside crime of Midsomer Motherfuckin’ Murders, luxuriate in a more drawn-out silliness. My favourite was the aunties’ western-inspired showdown over leftovers. It is not hard to see Famalam’s punchlines coming long before they land, but they fly past in such a frenzy of energy that it is hard to mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2cfe2781bc849e8ffc8bfb827d05f569c11a91/0_188_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=5000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=253999986c180b5bbedafbfc2eb6d8fd 10000w","title":"eternal sunshine las vegas perfect winter holiday","story":"From stargazing in the desert to world-famous pool parties, Las Vegas offers something for everyone looking to escape the cold and the rainWhen it’s cold, wet and generally miserable in the UK, why not head to Las Vegas for the flip side: sun, swimming pools and outdoor adventures. Though it’s a few hundred miles from the ocean, you’ll still find beaches, some of which are home to a vibrant daytime party scene. Nearby there are stunning natural wonders — mountains, lakes and hiking trails – perfect for all kinds of recreational activities. With so many options for fun in the sun, we take a look at some of the best.A full beach experience right on the Strip. Body surf in the wave pool, relax on a day bed, or take a gentle float down the lazy river. There are cabanas for all temperaments, whether you want seclusion or want to party. To really get away from the crowds, hire a cabana or gazebo with private pool and lounge area. The beach is family friendly, but head to the nearby Toptional Moorea club for a more grown-up experience.Mandalay Bay, 3950 S. Las Vegas Blvd.No need to stop the party just because the sun is shining – Wet Republic supplies the beats, dipping pools and festive atmosphere for all-day clubbing. A-list DJs, including Calvin Harris, Tiësto and Kaskade, keep the party going while there are a range of VIP options — take a bungalow for privacy and a personal jacuzzi, or be right in the action and book a banquette by the dance floor.MGM Grand, 3799 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Pick a pool. Caesars Palace has seven to choose from, each with its own theme. They all feature cabanas and day beds, so be guided by your mood. The Apollo pool receives the most sunlight, while the Jupiter is more secluded. Gamers will like the Fortuna, which has a swim-up blackjack table, while those looking for a European vibe should head for the Venus pool lounge. For the ultimate in relaxation book a massage session with Qua Baths \u0026amp Spa, which offers poolside services.Caesars Palace, 3570 S. Las Vegas Blvd.The Wynn’s day life unfolds at the Encore, a beach club that centres around its three-tiered pools. The DJ talent is world class, with the likes of the Chainsmokers, David Guetta and Diplo on the roster. Comfy cabanas come with a lush day bed, TV (who’s watching TV with a party raging outside?) and stocked fridge. Bungalow residents get extra luxuries such as a cooling system, infinity pool and, crucially, a private bathroom.Wynn Las Vegas, 3131 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Just a half-hour’s drive from the Strip is Lake Mead, a recreation area known as the most erse in America. Visitors come for year-round activities, including jet skiing, paddleboarding, sport fishing and kayaking. There are a number of picnic spots throughout the park, and for a night away from the city’s hubbub, pitch a tent in one of the 10 campgrounds, or stay at one of the lakeside resorts.The Tank, as the Golden Nugget’s pool is called, can boast what no other can: here you can swim with sharks. Well, almost. An enclosed waterslide plunges nine metres, travelling through an aquarium filled with some 300 sea creatures, including said sharks and sting rays. The H2O bar supplies the drinks, while lounging in the sun is as strenuous as things need to get if you prefer. On the third floor is the Hideout, an infinity pool for over-21s with day beds, chaise lounges and luxury cabanas.Golden Nugget, 129 E. Fremont StreetA visit to the Hoover Dam is on many a bucket list, but to really experience the magnificence of the structure hop in a kayak. As you paddle out into the Colorado River, you’ll have an epic view as the 220-metre (726-foot) dam looms above. A number of companies offer day or half-day tours that take in highlights of the Black Canyon, including sauna caves and geothermal hot springs. Desert bighorn sheep, falcons and bald eagles are some of the wildlife that you might spot. The water is flat and suitable for beginners.The Dayclub is responsible for party duties at The Cosmopolitan in the day time. Spanning the multilevel Marquee Nightclub, there are also two pools, which is where you want to be to take in the first-class DJ action, including the likes of Dash Berlin, DJ Mustard and Tritonal. Upgrade to a grand cabana for dedicated service and infinity dipping pools, or go large with a bungalow that has its own pool, party deck and sleeping quarters.The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, 3708 S. Las Vegas Blvd.Less than an hour’s drive from Las Vegas is Mount Charleston, a 3,700-metre (12,000-foot) peak that is part of the Spring Mountains, which rise spectacularly out of the Mojave desert. There are more than 50 miles of trails to explore, four campgrounds and a range of activities from horseback riding to biking. The Lee Canyon resort offers winter skiing, snowshoeing and tubing, as well as disc golf during the warmer months. Other places to stay nearby include the well-appointed Mt Charleston Las Vegas resort.It might sit atop the Downtown Grand Hotel but the vibe at this pool deck is one of backyard party. Family-friendly games include corn hole, foosball and table tennis, while there is plenty of space for lounging (cabanas are also available for hire), a full bar and a restaurant helmed by chef Scott Cummings, a former-Hell’s Kitchen winner. DJs and live entertainment also feature at weekends. As a bonus, there are superb views of downtown Las Vegas.Downtown Grand, 206 N. 3rd StreetFifteen miles west of Las Vegas sits the Red Rock Canyon Conservation Area, nearly 81,000 hectares (200,000 acres) of rugged beauty. It’s known for its hiking trails (there are 26 numbered hikes), which cater for all levels of fitness and reach from canyon floors to the highest points. A 13-mile paved road provides a scenic drive through stunning desert landscapes other activities include mountain biking, horseback riding and target shooting — it’s also a wonderful spot for stargazing.This luxurious but relaxed resort, away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, has two pools. The M Pool is the family-friendly version it has plenty of seating and cabanas for hire, and there are two large hot tubs on the pool deck. The over-21s pool club, DayDream, open at weekends and on holidays, is much more adult focused, with bar and bottle service available as well as top-name DJs providing the tunes.M Resort Spa Casino, 12300 S.

But with a direct clash between Russia and the US unlikely, Moscow may look for other ways to strike back at the west, using Russia’s status as superpower spoiler to undermine key goals of US foreign policy.There are a number of ways that Russia could cause problems for the US and its allies abroad by providing more advanced arms to Syria or helping North Korea flout sanctions, as well as heating up the Ukraine crisis, launching cyberattacks or upping support for rightwing populist politicians across Europe.Unprecedented protests demand civil liberties and the release of political prisoners after four decades of repressive rule by the Assad family. The regime represses demonstrations in Damascus and the southern city of Deraa but protests continue.Defecting army colonel Riad al-Asaad sets up the Turkey-based rebel Free Syrian Army. Islamist groups join the revolt.Regime forces take control of the rebel stronghold in Homs after a month of bombardment. Other bloody operations are carried out, notably in the central city of Hama, after massive anti-regime protests.FSA fighters launch a battle for Damascus but the government holds firm.More than 1,400 people die in a chemical weapon attack on rebel-held districts near Damascus.The US and Assad ally Russia agree a plan to eliminate Syria\u0027s chemical weapons, averting punitive US strikes against the regime.Hostilities between jihadists and rebel groups turn into an open war in the north. The group that will become known as Islamic State takes Raqqa – the first provincial capital to fall out of regime control – from rebel forces.A US-led coalition launches airstrikes against Isis in Syria. The strikes benefit Kurdish groups, which since 2013 have run autonomous administrations in Kurdish-majority areas.Russia launches airstrikes in support of Assad\u0027s troops, who are on the back foot. Russian firepower helps turn the tables for the regime, which begins to retake rebel-held territory.Russia and Iran, as backers of the Syrian regime, and Turkey, a supporter of the rebels, organise talks in Kazakhstan, between representatives of both sides. The process leads to the creation of four de-escalation zones.A sarin gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun kills more than 80 people, prompting Washington to attack a regime airbase.Further complicating an already drawn-out conflict, Turkey launches an operation against the Kurdish People\u0027s Protection Units which, with US support, played a key role in beating back Isis.Regime launches a ferocious assault on the remaining rebel-held enclave near Damascus, eastern Ghouta. In under four weeks, the Russian-backed onslaught kills more than 1,200 civilians.But Moscow may opt not to escalate, as it did not after the US cruise missile strike on the Shayrat airbase in 2017, recognising that the strikes were a one-off largely designed to send a political message and would not have a long-term impact on Assad’s prospects or the war in Syria.That would leave the door open to another prize that analysts say Russia wants at the moment: a public summit between Putin and Donald Trump like the one the US president had proposed in a phone call last month, which could change, or at least marginally improve, the dynamic in Moscow’s favour.From a simple point of view, Saturday’s missile strikes appear to be the latest escalation on Syria’s crowded battlefield, where a half-dozen countries and their proxies are jostling for influence and territory.Moscow’s nominal response was to convene a UN security council session to condemn the strikes (its resolution failed to pass) and threaten to sell advanced Russian S-300 air defence systems to Syria and other countries, deterring interventions in Syria for states such as Israel.Sanctions are another possibile response. Russian lawmakers are already proposing countermeasures to US sanctions earlier this month that targeted businessmen close to Putin and sent Russian stocks tumbling.Russia may block access to its market for imports of food and drink or target companies such as Boeing by banning titanium exports. But Moscow lacks the economic heft to inflict equal pain through sanctions and some ideas proposed by lawmakers sound outlandish, like allowing Russian firms to pirate US products by ignoring intellectual property law.Other possible responses include the use of cyber-weapons, which have increasingly played a role in the jousting between Russia and the west since 2014, with hackers cracking power grids and other key infrastructure, leaking sensitive political information and stealing private communications between government officials.Earlier this year, the UK government publicly accused Russia of launching the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack that crippled key infrastructure and firms across Europe, including some hospitals in the UK. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, accused Russia in February of “ripping up the rulebook”. “We have entered a new era of warfare, witnessing a destructive and deadly mix of conventional military might and malicious cyber-attacks,” he warned.Through its proxies, Russia could also seek to put pressure on US troops who are fighting in Syria alongside opposition forces. But that could also put Russians at risk. Earlier this week, the CIA director Mike Pompeo told the Senate that US forces had killed “a couple hundred” Russian mercenaries in a shadowy clash that had taken place in February.Despite the heated rhetoric, Saturday’s strike may paradoxically signal a de-escalation. There was a sense of relief in Moscow, and one of defiance in Syria, as it became clear that the strikes would be limited to three sites in Syria linked to chemical weapons production.Seen in context, the attack concluded a tense public negotiation that allowed the US and other western countries to respond to the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons without sparking an all-out war with Russia. After the strikes, all sides declared victory.Analysts, some who serve Russia in advisory capacities, said this week that a direct military response from Moscow would be extremely unlikely unless Russia’s red line – a threat to its soldiers in Syria – were crossed. Russia could likely brush off the attack, they said, publicly complaining but privately staying its course in Syria that has seen the Assad regime brought back from near defeat. A limited response could keep a meeting with Trump on the table, they said, and the US leader’s unpredictability meant that could provide a very attractive upside. “We’ll buzz your ships,” one said of Moscow’s expected retaliation. “I don’t think we’re about to sink the USS Cook.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Galway historian calls for full exhumation of remains of babies on site of Tuam homeCampaign group hosting event to address health service\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquolack of co-operation\u0026rsquoAny increases will be \u0026lsquomoderate and affordable\u0026rsquo despite rise in property valuesEvent held to mark centenary of ex-Irish Parliamentary Party leader\u0026rsquos deathConsultant body calls on the Minister to urgently act on the specialist training issueSome 23,600 young people take part in the Student Enterprise Programme this yearGarda\u0026iacute discover quantity of cannabis herb after stopping speeding car on M8Light-coloured saloon car failed to remain at scene of incident in early hours of SaturdayBishop says there are effects if society decides \u0026lsquohuman life is disposable\u0026rsquoCork County Hall to have exhibition and commemorative plaqueGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses after truck driver found dead at Co Wexford portRomanian national Ioan Artene Bob dies after being found in Sean Walsh Park on FridayCrisis management group had recommended in March that McCann should step asideEvent tackles concerns over World Meeting of Families in Ireland, which pope is to attendOscar-nominated film maker says amendment is a symptom of the \u0026lsquoold darkness\u0026rsquoThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462214.1523707848!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"limited bombardment reflects little appetite for engagement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe strikes on Syria  were designed to degrade the Syrian regime’s ability to research, develop and deploy chemical weapons. Photograph: SANAAPLasting just 70 minutes and involving 103 missiles, Saturday’s bombardment of Syria was more modest than the rhetoric from Washington, Paris and London portended and is unlikely to serve as a significant deterrent to Bashar al-Assad. If Russian claims that Syrian air defences shot down 71 of the missiles are true, the impact of the operation, which US defence secretary James Mattis described as “a one-time shot”, will be slighter still.The limited nature of the bombardment reflects the political reality that there is little appetite in the US, France or Britain for any significant military engagement in Syria. And the Pentagon appears to have persuaded the White House that the attack had to be narrowly targeted to avoid striking Russian and Iranian military personnel in the country.Theresa May stressed on Saturday that the air strikes were not about regime change or about interfering in a civil war. Instead, they were designed to degrade the Syrian regime’s ability to research, develop and deploy chemical weapons and to send a message that the international community will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons.A YouGov poll conducted in the days before the attack found just one in five in Britain supported the operation, with twice as many saying they opposed it. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the action had no legal basis and May will face tough questions from MPs when she makes a statement in the House of Commons on Monday.Despite the political difficulties, May was always likely to offer British support for the operation, not least as a signal of Britain’s determination to play a global role after Brexit.The airstrikes followed an internal dispute within the Trump administration, with the president and his national security adviser John Bolton favouring a more expansive operation while the Pentagon urged caution. French president Emmanuel Macron was the most resolute of the three leaders in his commitment to striking Syria but in the hours before the attack, he called for dialogue with Russia to be maintained and stepped up in an effort to bring peace and stability to Syria.If Saturday’s operation had the secondary purpose of increasing pressure on Moscow to persuade Assad to reach a peace deal with Syrian opposition forces, there is little immediate sign that it will do so.After seven years of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions, Assad is closer to victory than ever before. And if he was responsible for the chemical attack in Douma, his war crime achieved its military objective – on Saturday morning, his forces entered the rebel holdout, predicting that it would be secured within 24 hours.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Theresa May to seek Commons debate amid calls she lacked authority for attackUK, US and France target alleged chemical weapons facilities in bombing campaignMilitary action against Syria brings warnings from Iran and most Arab governmentsUS ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weaponsVincent Durac: It\u0026rsquos expected this US-led attack will be of much longer duration than last year\u0026rsquos\u0026lsquoWe are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents\u0026rsquoGrim total of 511,000 casualties may be disputed but each death is vital to accountabilityUN inspectors arrive in Syria to investigate last week\u0026rsquos chemical weapons assaultOne killed and more than 100 injured from live Israeli fireBritain asks Cyprus to reserve airspace in preparation for possible air strikes on SyriaMore than 40 people were killed in the strike in Douma last week, WHO saysEmmanuel Macron says he has proof of Syria\u0026rsquos guilt but needs to gather more informationOfficials believe both chlorine and a nerve agent were used in weekend attackTrump breaks with national security protocols to warn of imminent attack on SyriaUS president keen on sending strong message to Assad, but at what potential cost?Eurocontrol warns carriers to exercise caution over eastern Mediterranean regionRegime and Russian allies blame Israel for strike on air base in which 14 killedPresident Rouhani says Tehran\u0026rsquos response would be stronger than US imaginesLegal action is first war crimes-related case against Syrian regime to reach courtDozens in eastern Ghouta reported dead UN security council to meet on MondayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462342.1523788766!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"assad says syrian air strikes were act of aggression reports","story":"More chemical attacks in Syria will not be tolerated and the U.S. is prepared to strike again according to US Vice President Mike Pence, who added his voice to the chorus of warnings to Syria.

Photograph: Hassan AmmarAPSyrian president Bashar al-Assad told a group of Russian politicians on Sunday that Western missile strikes on his country were an act of aggression, Russian news agencies reported.Russian politicians met with Mr Assad after the United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Syria a week ago, targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapons facilities, including a research and development centre in the Barzeh district of Damascus and two installations near Homs.The bombing was the biggest intervention by Western countries against Mr Assad and his superpower ally Russia, but the three countries said the strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling Mr Assad or intervening in the civil war.Russian news agencies quoted politicians as saying Mr Assad was in a “good mood” and had praised the Soviet-era air defence systems used by Syria to help to repel the Western attacks.The supply of Russian air defence systems was not discussed, agencies reported, but Mr Assad accepted an invitation to visit the Siberian region of Khanty-Mansi in Russia. It was not clear when the visit would take place.US president Donald Trump called the operation a success, tweeting “Mission accomplished”.The US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council that Mr Trump told her that if Syria uses poisonous gas again, “The United States is locked and loaded.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the strikes were “unacceptable and lawless.”Syrian state media called them a “flagrant violation of international law,” while Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called it a crime and the Western leaders criminals.Russia had promised to respond to any attack on its ally, but the Pentagon said no Russian air defence systems were used. Syria fired 40 unguided surface-to-air missiles - but only after the Western strikes had ended, the Pentagon said.British prime minister Theresa May described the strike as “limited and targeted,” with no intention of toppling Assad or intervening more widely in the war.Ms May has faced a backlash from MPs, with Jeremy Corbyn calling for a war powers act to give parliament more scrutiny over military action.Appearing on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show, the Labour leader questioned the legal basis for the UK joining the US and France in air strikes in response to the chemical weapons attack in Douma.Mr Corbyn said Parliament should have been given a vote ahead of the strikes.“I think what we need in this country is something more robust like a War Powers Act so that governments do get held to account by Parliament for what they do in our name.”The Labour leader warned of an escalation in a “proxy war” between the US and Russia. He said chlorine has been used by “a number of parties in the conflict” in Syria as a weapon.Mr Corbyn said that if Britain wants to “get the moral high ground around the world” it must abide by international law for taking military action.“Where is the legal basis for this?” he said.Foreign secretary Boris Johnson said “finally the world has said enough is enough” as he defended the “proportionate” action.“There is no proposal on the table at the moment for further attacks because so far — thank heavens — the Assad regime has not been so foolish to launch another chemical weapons attack.”Mr Johnson added: “If and when such a thing were to happen then clearly, with allies, we would study what the options were.”UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all Security Council members to exercise restraint and avoid escalation in Syria, but said allegations of chemical weapons use demand an investigation.In Sydney, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull urged Russia to drop its “pretence” that Syria was not behind the chemical attack on Douma and use its influence to force the Assad government to destroy its chemical weapons.“Russia has used its position as a member of the United Nations Security Council to veto resolutions designed to ensure that this chemical weapons crime is thoroughly investigated and cannot be repeated,” he told a news conference on Sunday.Washington described the strike targets as a centre near Damascus for the research, development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons a chemical weapons storage site near the city of Homs and another site near Homs that stored chemical weapons equipment and housed a command post.The Pentagon said there had been chemical weapons agents at one of the targets, and that the strikes had significantly crippled Syria’s ability to produce such weapons.There were no immediate reports of casualties.The United States, Britain and France have all participated in the Syrian conflict for years, arming rebels, bombing Islamic State fighters and deploying troops on the ground to fight that group. But they have refrained from targeting Assad’s government, apart from a volley of US missiles last year.Inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW were due to try to visit Douma on Saturday to inspect the site of the suspected gas attack. Moscow condemned the Western states for refusing to wait for their findings.Russia, whose relations with the West have deteriorated to levels of Cold War-era hostility, has denied any gas attack took place in Douma and even accused Britain of staging it to whip up anti-Russian hysteria.Syria agreed in 2013 to give up its chemical weapons after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in Douma. Damascus is still permitted to have chlorine for civilian use, although its use as a weapon is banned. Allegations of Assad’s chlorine use have been frequent during the war although, unlike nerve agents, chlorine did not produce mass casualties as seen last week.Read full coverage of events hereThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Hellyer, senior research fellow at the Atlantic Council and the Royal United Services Institute in London, said.“Contacts already exist between the UK and the Assad regime through different channels which do not show an endorsement of the regime – this, on the other hand, is done for no other reason except to give Damascus a chance to push propaganda.”Pope Francis meanwhile said on Sunday that he was \u0026quotdeeply disturbed\u0026quot by the international community\u0027s failure to come up with a common response to the crisis in Syria.\u0026quotDespite the tools available to the international community, it is difficult to agree on a common action toward peace in Syria or other regions of the world,\u0026quot the pope told a crowd of 30,000 after his traditional Sunday blessing.Francis called on \u0026quotall people of goodwill\u0026quot to join him in praying for peace, and appealed to political leaders to help \u0026quotjustice prevail.\u0026quotMilitary families given £246m of taxpayers\u0026#39 money to send their children to private schoolChildren should play with \u0026#39softer balls\u0026#39, charity says, as girls \u0026#39switched off sport\u0026#39 for life by competitive PE lessonsStephen Lawrence\u0026#39s father says he has finally forgiven his son\u0026#39s killers 25 years onPatients will have the power to choose how taxpayer money for their healthcare is spent, ministers sayAssad can still gas his own people despite airstrikes, says former chemical weapons chief who fled SyriaParents \u0026#39faking marriage breakdowns\u0026#39 to get children into top primary schools in admission fraud riseComment: Western action in Syria sends a strong message, but will not really change anything Former first lady Barbara Bush in failing healthBritain pushes for Syrian ceasefire alongside US and FranceWhy sprinting on the inside track could cost athletes a medalBritain\u0026#39s safest car revealed, with no road deaths in 16 yearsVictoria Cross hero admits: \u0026#39I was a machine-gun toting drug dealer before I joined the Army\u0026#39France warns of fresh humanitarian crisis in Syrian region of IdlibSupporters of burglar killed during break-in hold birthday vigil outside house where he diedNicola Sturgeon calls for debate after missile attacks on Syria Rape and murder of teenage girl sparks mass protests in India after politician\u0026#39s arrestFirst group of Rohingya refugees returns to Myanmar Rail firm threatens legal action against passenger who mocked their poor service Queen\u0026#39s \u0026#39heart of gold\u0026#39 stolen from French museumWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/15/TELEMMGLPICT000002376293_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkUE_BTgBOQu3VWKvpDGX9R0ii9gpoWvtypQzOwukBLc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"eliza doolittle already strong feminist character she doesnt","story":"Eliza Doolittle is a strong enough character without being made older than Shaw says she wasGeorge Bernard Shaw was by any standards, not just those of his day, a feminist, subverter of conventional morals and political troublemaker generally.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesSir Patrick Stewart addresses the crowd during the People\u0027s Vote campaign launch on Brexit at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Yes, that’s about where we are.“The government is listening on the important aspects of the bill and I think that’s what the overall tone of the debate from the crossbenchers will be – that, actually, the government is listening and taking appropriate action.“But there was always going to be a time when this type of amendment, the customs union amendment, was going to cause a bit of a clash. We’ll just have to see how the debate goes.”In advance of Wednesday, Brexit minister Lord Callanan has tabled a small number of government amendments in response to earlier debates, but Tory insiders have been at pains to underline how they are technical in nature and do not “compromise” on the major principles of the Bill, with Conservative right-wingers keeping a close eye on proceedings.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017.

A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Bangladesh has given Myanmar a list of more than 8,000 refugees to begin the repatriation, but the return has been delayed by a complicated verification process. The two countries agreed in December to begin repatriating the refugees in January, but there were concerns among aid workers and Rohingya that they would be forced to return and face unsafe conditions in Myanmar. Hundreds of Rohingya were reportedly killed in the recent violence, and many houses and villages burnt to the ground. The United Nations and the US have described the army crackdown as “ethnic cleansing”. On Friday, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and Bangladesh finalised a memorandum of understanding that describes the repatriation process as “safe, voluntary and dignified ... in line with international standards”. Photos ‘show dozens of burned Muslim villages being bulldozed’The UNHCR said it considers that “conditions in Myanmar are not yet conducive for returns to be safe, dignified and sustainable. The responsibility for creating such conditions remains with the Myanmar authorities, and these must go beyond the preparation of physical infrastructure to facilitate logistical arrangements.” Earlier in the week, Myanmar social welfare minister Win Myat Aye met with about 40 Rohingya refugees at the Kutupalong camp in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh for more than an hour, sometimes exchanging heated words. A Rohingya leader, Abdur Rahim, said at least eight rape victims were among the group.Mr Rahim said the group presented 13 demands for the government to meet for their return to Myanmar. Rohingya refugees – in picturesRohingya refugees – in picturesA young girl and a baby wade through mud after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh from Burma on 10 SeptemberRohingya refugees walk through a camp in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh after arriving from BurmaA young Rohingya refugee gathers firewood after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh from BurmaRohingya refugees wait for sacks of rice to be distributed in Whaikhyang, BangladeshRohingya Muslim refugees arrive on a boat in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh after crossing from Burma on 8 SeptemberRohingya Muslim refugees react after being re-united with each other after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh on a boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees walk along the remains of a road after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh on a boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees wade through water after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees wade through water after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from Myanmar Rohingya Muslim refugees stand in the rain after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from BurmaIndian children hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the alleged persecution of the Rohingya Muslims in BurmaSupporters of the Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC), an Islamic organisation, listen to their leaders\u0027 speeches against Burma\u0027s persecution of Rohingya Muslims, during a demonstration in KarachiHundreds of Iranians take part in a protest against violence in Myanmar after weekly Friday prayers, in TehranIndonesian Muslim activists hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the alleged persecution of the Rohingya minority in Magelang, Central Java, IndonesiaMembers of an Islamic organisation shout slogans against the Burma government during a protest in Dhaka, BangladeshThe refugees apparently became angry when told they must accept national verification cards provided by Myanmar that state they are migrants from Bangladesh. Rohingya Muslims have long been treated as outsiders in Myanmar, even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. They are denied freedom of movement and other basic rights. Mr Rahim said they demanded to be recognised as citizens of Myanmar before the repatriation starts and that their security arrangements be supervised by the UN. Rohingya who have been repatriated in the past after previous refugee exoduses have been forced to live in camps in Myanmar. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She looks at me like I’m making a big mistake – she would turn out to be right.Getting to France from Brussels to cover the rail strikes that are paralysing the country is proving rather difficult. It’s normally a breezy half an hour to Lille on a high speed TGV from The Independent’s bureau in the Belgian capital, but those few services that are still running were booked up weeks in advance. I had managed to snag a ticket on the Eurostar, but that was then cancelled too, so decide to do the entire journey by slow Belgian suburban services – which aren’t on strike despite sometimes venturing over the border into France. It would take a while, but get me there eventually, or so I thought.Eurostar cancels trains as Macron protests erupt across ParisAn hour into my journey my optimism is shattered when a smartly uniformed train guard taps me on the shoulder. “Lille?” he asks. I nod, and he explains that the connecting Belgian service I was planning to take is now cancelled and I’ll have an extra hour’s wait at Tournai, the border city where I was planning to sneak into France.I do my time at Tournai’s ornate station alongside a gaggle of other fools braving the industrial dispute, and my train to France finally pulls in. But before it has ground to a halt, déjà vu strikes. “Lille?” I turn around, and another guard is standing there. I nod, like last time. “There is no Lille… they are blocking the way.” It turns out the French rail workers have anticipated my crafty workaround and, as well as stopping French services, have now physically blockaded the tracks to prevent Belgian trains getting anywhere near France as well. Of the dozen other travellers I am standing with, one looks distraught – but most shrug and accept that this is the way of things. “It’s a strike,” one man tells me. “It’s how it goes.” My train sits empty in the station, and will go no further.British commuters may think they know about rail strikes, but the French do them properly. Workers are walking off the job for 36 days scattered throughout April, May and June, with as many as four stoppages at week. France has invested heavily in its high speed rail network since the 1970s, and the country now relies on TGV services to get things done. Why is France\u0027s transport network mired in strikes?Air France strikes see a third of flights cancelledFrance strikes: another disrupted weekend for air and rail passengersFrance to cut number of MPs by almost a thirdWhen those trains don’t work, neither does the country. About 40 per cent of rail workers have participated in the strikes so far, and SNCF, the French national railway company, says it is running just one in three services and is urging passengers to stay away. Some cities also have separate strikes on their local bus and metro systems, with workers in, for example, Rouen taking 55 minutes out a day until late April – just enough to mess up timetables. You’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise, but in France only around 8 per cent of workers are union members – far fewer than even in Britain, where about 25 per cent of employees pay dues. But despite the low membership across the economy, unionised workers are highly concentrated and more prepared to take direct action – like blockading international railway tracks.The reason behind the national rail strike is Emmanuel Macron’s plans to cut conditions for workers on the French railways. The government wants to end guaranteed job security and early pensions for SNCF employees, and says the move to cut workers’ compensation is the only way to reduce the €47bn in legacy debt the national rail company has on its books. But the industrial dispute has taken on wider political connotations, and has turned into a key test for Macron’s liberalising economic agenda – with comparisons inevitably drawn to Margaret Thatcher and the miners\u0027 strike.  Emmanuel Macron is not popular – but appears to have public backing on his changes to SNCF (Etienne LaurentPool Photo via AP)The French president made his first major statement on the strike in a television interview on Thursday, pledging that he would not back down. “We must go to the end, because we have to make this reform. It is indispensable. It would be hypocritical not to do it we need a strong French railway,” he told TF1. “The reform requires a little effort from everyone. Users have made efforts, prices have increased. We ask the company, SNCF, that it must reorganise.”But union leaders have taken an equally tough stance. “We\u0027re going to have a marathon if the government forces it,” Laurent Brun of the CGT rail union said on Friday after two days of talks with government negotiators. He hinted that the strike could be extended beyond its scheduled end on 28 June if the government did not back down or make concessions.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFireworks are set off as the final performance takes place during the Closing Ceremony for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.The wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre compound in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, after the United States, UK and France launched strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime early on April 14 in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack after mulling military action for nearly a week.
