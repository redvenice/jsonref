The United States and North Korea announced on Tuesday that they will resume talks this weekend about Pyongyang\u0027s nuclear program. President Trump (left) and North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un (right) are seen on the North Korean side of the border in Panmunjon in JuneThat could be a tall order. In the high-stakes diplomacy between Trump and Kim, which has been driven chiefly by the personalities of the leaders rather than an established diplomatic process, working-level meetings have been useful for fleshing out the logistics of summits but unproductive in hammering out the details of a nuclear deal that has eluded the countries for decades.The stalemate of past months has revealed fundamental differences between the two sides. North Korea says it will never unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons and missiles and insists that U.S.-led sanctions against it should be lifted first before any progress in negotiations.The Trump administration has vowed to maintain robust economic pressure until North Korea takes real steps toward fully and verifiably relinquishing its nuclear program.Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said progress in working-level negotiations would depend on several factors, including whether Kim empowers his officials to negotiate concrete steps and whether the Trump administration embraces \u0027a phased approach where summits and sanctions relief must be earned, but denuclearization is not decided all at once.\u0027There are doubts about whether Kim would ever voluntarily deal away an arsenal that he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival.In his first public appearance since his departure from the White House, Bolton on Monday gave a characteristically pessimistic outlook on the prospects for nuclear negotiations with the North and challenged Trump\u0027s foreign policy without directly mentioning the president.At a forum in Washington hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Bolton said Kim has made a \u0027strategic decision\u0027 to do whatever he can to keep his country\u0027s nuclear weapons and that is an \u0027unacceptable\u0027 threat to the world.\u0027Under current circumstances, he will never give up nuclear weapons voluntarily,\u0027 Bolton said. \u0027This is a government that has essentially violated every international agreement it has ever made.\u0027After their Singapore summit in June 2018, Trump and Kim issued a vague statement calling for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing how or when it would occur.The lack of substance and fruitless working-level talks set up the failure in Hanoi, which the Americans blamed on what they said were excessive North Korean demands for sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling an aging nuclear facility in Yongbyon. Trump and Kim met for the third time at the inter-Korean border on June 30 and agreed that working-level talks between the countries should resume."},{"url":null,"title":"Reggae superstar Bob Marley honoured English Heritage blue plaque","story":"Share this article Though he gave a different address, it is speculated that Marley did so to prevent the police from searching the house in Oakley Street - where his band-mates were staying - for drugs.Other anecdotal reports from witnesses suggested the house was the band\u0027s headquarters and Marley\u0027s primary address.The plaque was unveiled by Rastafarian writer and poet Benjamin Zephaniah and introduced by historian and broadcaster David Olusoga, who is also a blue plaque panel member.

Pictured, some of those receiving the plaques this yearMarley performed at the Crystal Palace Bowl on June 7, 1980 while gravely ill. It would prove to be his last appearance in the UK, with the legendary musician dying less then a year later.   The cultural icon already has two blue plaques in London, including at a house he stayed at in Neasden, north west London, and Flat 34 Ridgmount Gardens in central London, the place where he first stayed in the capital.Mr Olusoga, English Heritage trustee and blue plaques panel member, said: \u0027Bob Marley was the first superstar to emerge from the developing world. More than a brilliant musician, he became a cultural icon who blazed a trail for other black artists.\u0027Traveller and diplomat Gertrude Bell and novelist Angela Carter are among several other famous figures commemorated with blue plaques this year.Mr Olusoga added: \u0027From engineering to music, this year\u0027s blue plaques remind us of the enormous range of human achievement.\u0027All of our blue plaque recipients called London home, at least for a while, and our plaques are a testament to the creativity and variety of this city.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Maverick No10 chief Dominic Cummings like small child meetings","story":"Share this article He fuelled the row last week by speaking publicly about the Brexit standoff, saying MPs should not be \u0027surprised\u0027 at public fury.\u0027The MPs said we will have a referendum, we will respect the result and then they spent three years swerving all over the shop,\u0027 he said. Lifting the curtain on what it is like working with Mr Cummings at the heart of government, the minister told MailOnline: \u0027In meetings, it\u0027s a lot like having a small child in the corner - \u0027\u0027Why?

For this reason, Prince Harry’s takeover of the National Geographic Instagram account to encourage people to “look up” and get lost in the beauty of trees is a weirdly enticing concept.On Monday, the Duke of Sussex curated a set of images of forest canopies each taken by National Geographic photographers, which went out to the publication’s 123 million followers. The idea was to highlight the importance of conservation while spotlighting the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy campaign, which will result in two national parks being created in South Africa, where Harry is touring. As part of the campaign, 50 countries have either dedicated indigenous forest for conservation or committed to planting millions of new trees to combat climate change.One image shows Harry flat on his backside, taking a photo of an imposing South African baobab tree, which can live for more than 1,000 years and, due to its size, even sustain its own ecosystem. The Duke has captured its spindly branches with a finesse rewarded by 412,000 likes. The other photographs, which include a red-leafed autumnal British tree and the distinctive strangler fig, with its branches knotted together like a spider’s web, are strikingly beautiful. It is a shame, though, that the accompanying captions – in which Harry describes how the strangler fig’s twisty barks helped it earn its name or why the red leaves of autumn in the UK are special – are so alarmingly redolent of a basic Wikipedia search.A few more details on why these trees are so ecologically important might have been a good idea. Fortunately, the National Geographic’s enthusiastic readers don’t seem to mind: one of the top-rated comments is from rappers Cypress Hill, whose use of the tree emoji may allude to sparking up debate about a very different kind of plant.Thanks to its snappy hashtag (#LookingUp) and hundreds of thousands of likes, the campaign will at least encourage Instagram users to find out more about the potential of planting trees. New research predicts that a worldwide planting programme could have a “mind-blowing” effect by removing as many as two-thirds of all the emissions that humans currently pump into the atmosphere. It argues that with 1.7bn hectares of treeless land available, which is roughly the same size as the US and China combined, around 1.2tn native tree saplings could be naturally grown. Suddenly, Harry liking trees seems kind of cool.Critics will surely point to the hypocrisy of Harry fronting an eco-friendly campaign while riding around in a private jet. Nonetheless, in encouraging the public to regard trees as holy beings, rather than disposable wood, his takeover of the National Geographic’s Instagram spotlights the important role these natural giants can play in preserving the future of our planet.Prince Charles, infamously once revealed how he likes to talk to his plants, but Harry’s fascination with trees appears less like a midlife crisis and more like a savvy social media-friendly way to address global warming. After weeks of unflattering headlines about his and Meghan’s travelling habits, Harry’s tree-hugging won’t do much to get them back on side, but in terms of positioning the Duke of Sussex as, well, the Green Prince, it looks like mission accomplished."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03fac67cbb24fb331aea79de32a5bc481da1a5b7/0_212_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ff95ff90457c28c0dc783b2fdce1065","title":"va to close raphael cartoons gallery for major revamp","story":"Project planned for 2020 will show Renaissance treasures in unprecedented detailOne of the UK’s most dramatic gallery spaces, which displays the Raphael Cartoons, is to close temporarily to allow the first major refurbishment in more than 25 years.On Tuesday the Victoria and Albert Museum in London announced details of a project planned for most of 2020 which it said would allow visitors to see artworks which are considered among the greatest treasures of the Renaissance in more detail than ever before.The cartoons are designs commissioned in 1515 by Pope Leo X for a series of tapestries in the Sistine Chapel illustrating the lives of St Peter and St Paul. Seven of 10 survive and were brought to Britain in the 17th century by the Prince of Wales, later Charles I.They remained in the royal collection until Queen Victoria loaned them to the South Kensington Museum in 1865 in memory of Prince Albert. They have remained stars of the museum, now the V\u0026ampA, ever since.The gallery where they hang was originally designed for the museum’s Indian art collection. In 1950 the cartoons were transferred there and it has proved “the perfect space” said Ana Debenedetti, the lead curator of the Raphael Project.“It has almost the same dimensions as the Sistine Chapel, only 2 sq metres of difference. It is a dramatic gallery which allows a meditative feeling and this is really what we want to enhance.”The Raphael Court was last refurbished between 1992-96 and a refresh was due, given that the natural lifecycle of such spaces is 25 years.The fact that 2020 is the the 500th anniversary of Raphael’s death gave an added impetus.Debenedetti said the new gallery would have state-of-the art lighting and a darker colour on the walls to help focus visitors’ eyes on the cartoons’ vibrant palette. There will also be enhanced interpretation including high-definition, infrared and 3D scans of the cartoons.Because the cartoons cannot be moved the work will go on around them from 27 January, with the hope of being completed by October. That would coincide with a major show planned by the National Gallery to open on 3 October.Debenedetti said the seven cartoons, each measuring 5 metres wide and 3.5 metres high, were “a unique Renaissance treasure, both in terms of aesthetic value and technical achievement”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e463c76f331f2ebdecd751ab91996ae36ba581d/0_177_5331_3201/master/5331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cbd5dd44d1f3ac78cf4032d4a98ef0a","title":"marks spencer to offer buy now pay later option online","story":"Chief tells investors retailer plans credit option for online customers to help revive fortunesMarks \u0026amp Spencer is to offer a “buy now, pay later” option to online shoppers as part of a plan to modernise its struggling clothing business which had a “lost 18 months”, the company has admitted.While maintaining its crown as the UK’s largest clothing retailer, sales at the high street giant have been falling for seven years. On Tuesday, its chief executive, Steve Rowe, told an investor meeting that letting customers pay for website orders in instalments was one of the “tactical actions” it planned to take to halt the slide. Rival chain Next has a substantial store card-style credit arm, and young shoppers are embracing digital payment systems such as Klarna in growing numbers. M\u0026ampS is yet to sign a contract with a payment service.M\u0026ampS is facing an existential crisis as sales migrate online and the recent collapse in its share price has cost the retailer its place in the prestigious FTSE 100. Rowe confessed to analysts that the revamp of its clothing business was 18 months behind schedule and he was still trying to fix “the basics: its buyers still bought too many clothes that didn’t sell, while popular lines sold out. Jill McDonald, its clothing boss, was ousted in July after buying mistakes ahead of a jeans promotion left it with empty rails for a month.While much of the focus falls on M\u0026ampS’s womenswear business, the company admitted its menswear ision needed attention after its market share had slipped by 1.5 percentage points over the last five years. Shoppers had told it the clothes were “too old” and the fightback involved it stocking more slim and skinny-fit trousers.With the Brexit deadline looming the company told the investor meeting that crashing out without a deal would have a substantial impact on its food-hall arm, where sales have stabilised under Stuart Machin.The turnaround is being steered by Archie Norman, its no-nonsense chairman of two years, and there are signs that he is growing impatient with performance. Last week the company said Humphrey Singer, its newish finance director, was, like McDonald, also headed for the exit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f605a870f421396b2ef4ab441a21bed3e61bd5f/74_0_4759_2856/master/4759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56227363e8dcfc286c50ef257897e361","title":"ryanair boss says the package holiday market is finished","story":"Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary has criticised Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority for awarding Thomas Cook a licence just months before its collapse and said the package holiday market was finished.Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest travel firm, collapsed last week, leaving more than 150,000 UK holidaymakers stranded abroad. O’Leary praised the CAA for its Operation Matterhorn rescue airline set up to bring back stranded passengers, but said it needed to do more to prevent airline failures in the first place.Speaking at a Reuters Newsmakers event, O’Leary added: “The CAA should be much more aggressive in requiring the shareholders of those companies to put up much more cash to get through the year, rather than allowing them to continually fail.”The CAA granted Thomas Cook its airline operating certificate in April while its Atol licence, which guarantees repatriation and refunds for holidaymakers if their tour operator goes bust, was due for renewal this month. Thomas Cook’s airline was profitable and had been put up for sale in February. However, a buyer could not be found.Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair’s chief marketing officer, said at a separate press briefing that Ryanair was lobbying the CAA to introduce more robust, quarterly stress tests for airlines and tour operators, and to force “financially weak” firms to set aside money to cover the repatriation of passengers should the companies go bust.Brexit“There is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many UK customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer,” said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, in May. But it cannot be the whole story - arch-rival Tui has coped because its finances are healthier.\u0026nbspWeatherThe summer heatwave of 2018 encouraged would-be holidaymakers to stay at home, undermining prices in the “lates” market where operators try to clear unsold holidays. There seems to have been a hangover into 2019, with customers calculating that waiting to book is a productive strategy.CompetitionA pincer movement of Airbnb and budget holidays has changed consumer behaviour, though Thomas Cook still managed to sell 11m package holidays last year.\u0026nbspBanks and debtThe tour operator has been attempting to shoulder a\u0026nbsp huge pile of debt for the past decade – £1.7bn worth at the last count. Successive managements failed to remove meaningful chunks. The banks argue they have supported an overstretched company for years and the details of why it could not be saved may have to await the report from the Insolvency Service.\u0026nbspBad managementThomas Cook’s borrowings were too high. The moral of the tale is that tour operators should fund themselves conservatively. If your balance sheet is fragile, you are at the mercy of events in an industry where most of the cash arrives in the summer and then flows out in the winter.The CAA said: “We thank Ryanair and the rest of the aviation industry for their support as we focus our efforts on repatriating 150,000 Thomas Cook passengers. The CAA is responsible for licensing travel businesses, including considering their financial fitness, and we take these responsibilities very seriously.“We also take part actively in discussions about reforming the regulatory framework. We participated fully in the independent insolvency review which investigated what more could be done to protect consumers in the event of a future insolvency. We stand ready to work with the government and industry to implement recommendations from the review.” O’Leary was blunt about the the package holiday market, saying it was “screwed, it’s over”.According to the travel industry group Abta , half of UK holidaymakers took a package holiday last year, a figure that has held steady since 2014. Thomas Cook’s rival Tui has fared better, with strong demand for for holiday experiences. It also owns many of its hotels.Ryanair, Europe’s biggest carrier expects passenger numbers to stay flat at 46.3m in the UK next year, despite a likely boost from former Thomas Cook customers. It launched 14 new routes including flights from London Stansted to Terceira in the Azores and Manchester to Pisa.Ryanair still plans to shut some lossmaking bases, and warned some pilots would lose their jobs, as it has 500 more than it needs. Jacobs said the number of redundancies would be lower than that as pilots who quit will not be replaced and others are being offered unpaid leave.O’Leary dismissed criticism of the €100m (£89m) bonus the airline could hand him over five years, saying it was an “easy target” for the mediaand they should focus on Premier League footballers’ pay instead.He said Ryanair would wait for “the next turn in the cycle” before ordering more Boeing or Airbus jets at cheaper prices.The Irish carrier is one of the biggest customers of Boeing’s grounded 737 Max aircraft, with 135 firm aircraft orders and 75 options, and O’Leary said the company could add Airbus jets to its fleet in the medium term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05bf712bbb40ad45540465f54a5fe37e319a4ed9/0_138_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ada13e6625a6633713ed11b65157dfa","title":"john lewis never knowingly understaffed","story":"Retail partnership’s cull of one in three top managers seems risky, but there could be some easy winsIf the big reorganisation of the John Lewis Partnership falls flat, who would incoming chair, Sharon White, fire?Well, it won’t be the chief executive since the partnership doesn’t employ anyone with that title. But nor, from next year, will there be managing directors – one for the department stores and one for Waitrose. Instead, White will chair an executive team comprising seven directors with responsibilities across both halves of the business.It’s unconventional, not least because White, current boss of communications regulator Ofcom, has never worked in retailing. And she’ll arrive in the new year to find that Rob Collins, the old-hand Waitrose boss, has gone, having decided there isn’t a job in the new structure that suits him.The risks, then, are obvious. Instead of “more innovation, faster decision-making and bolder steps”, as current chair Sir Charlie Mayfield describes the new approach, the outcome could be: apart from White, who’s actually in charge around here?But one can understand the thinking. If an annual £100m can be saved “over time” by being leaner, it would be odd to stand still. Retailing’s glory days aren’t coming back soon and rivals have also been chopping jobs from head office, even if the partnership’s cull of one in three out of 225 senior roles looks adventurous.There may also be some easy wins from integration. At the moment, John Lewis customers, by shoving so many “click and collect” orders towards their local Waitroses, appear more joined-up than management.So one can applaud the ambition. Making it work, though, is the hard part: it’s a partnership, but that doesn’t mean there can’t be turf battles.What a curious form of words. Credit Suisse responded to the spying scandal that has gripped the banking world by saying this: the investigation “did not identify any indication that the CEO had approved the observation of Iqbal Khan”.In other words, Tidjane Thiam, former chief at the Prudential in the UK, can stay in post. Instead, his deputy, chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouée, has been fired, having confessed that he alone ordered a surveillance job to be performed on Khan, who was skipping off to join arch-rival UBS.But how hard did the board, or its law firm Homburger, look for indications that might implicate Thiam? Well, it was a one-week investigation, which is brisk. And Credit Suisse confirmed that investigators from Homburger did not have access to deleted messages sent over an encrypted system. Nor could they see files held by police, who are still looking into potential criminal offences.Those features do not, of course, in themselves undermine the idea that Thiam was gloriously ignorant of what Bouée was doing. But we do know that Bouée was a loyal lieutenant, having risen with Thiam, all the way from Aviva and Prudential in the UK to Credit Suisse in Zurich.If Thiam was not aware that Bouée had ordered a high-risk and highly unusual surveillance job on a defecting colleague – one that has caused “severe reputational damage to the bank”, says the board – he surely should have known.Are you enjoying the cut and thrust of London’s biggest takeover battle in ages? You know the sort of thing – rival managements trading insults, politicians riding hobby-horses, corporate history on the line. You’ve missed it?Well, quite. The Hong Kong stock exchange’s £32bn hostile attempt to buy the London Stock Exchange has become a snooze-fest. The approach was made public three weeks ago, meaning the Hong Kong crew have only one more week under the rules to “put up or shut up”. So far, they’ve only been doing the latter.When Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) received a flat rejection last month, it said it was undeterred and would talk to the LSE’s shareholders instead. That process normally involves creating some noise in public and generally being a nuisance. In this case, onlookers were expecting a blistering and sustained attack on the LSE’s plan to pay $27bn (£22bn) for data and terminals group Refinitiv. Instead, there’s been near silence.Maybe HKEX will surprise us next Wednesday by making its terms hostile and formal. That would be brave since it remains hard to see how a takeover could succeed without backing from an LSE board that has said it sees “fundamental flaws” in the proposal.Alternatively, the would-be bidder could withdraw and retreat, which currently looks more likely. If so, what was the point of pitching up?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58118c51853673ed6cf8f8e89c5b6b5df8718041/486_0_3514_2109/master/3514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5531b09b21bfdd2317ab711f9efdff56","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of brave","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘brave’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘brave’.Share your photos of what brave means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 2 October at 10am.

When you’ve had your fill of two wheels, then enjoy a glass of wine in one of Canada’s largest wine regions.Celebrate Canada Day in Ottawa, OntarioPerfect for: fans of live musicWhere better to celebrate Canada Day than the country’s capital, Ottawa? Settle in at various spots around the city – Confederation Boulevard, Major’s Hill Park or the Ottawa River – and enjoy a full line-up of entertainment, including an air show courtesy of the Canadian armed forces, musical performances from the likes of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, followed by a fireworks display that’s sure to inspire Canadian pride, no matter where you’re from. There’s also free entry to national museums and art galleries.Try out cowboy skills on a ranch in AlbertaPerfect for: learning new skillsAlberta may be known for its iconic national parks (Banff has to be seen to be believed), but south of Banff has just as much to offer, in the form of cowboy country. With rolling foothills, vast cattle grounds, and sunsets that’ll stop you in your tracks, experience the cowboy lifestyle at one of the numerous working and guest ranches in the region. Saddle up for some cattle driving, help with daily chores, try your hand at horseshoe tossing, or opt for one of the more hotel-like guest ranches, with experiences such as horseback camping trips or even spa services on offer. Either way, you’re guaranteed a warm welcome, a break from the fast-pace of modern life, and an unforgettable stay. There are even half-day horse rides if you’re worried about being saddle sore.Go on a polar bear safari in Manitoba (and see the northern lights)Perfect for: adventurous animal-loversForget the Big Five – you’re in Canada now, and safari means one thing: polar bears. To see them in the wild you’ll need to head to Churchill, Manitoba – a region perfectly placed for spotting the iconic (and endangered) white bears in their natural environment, as they wait on the shore for the Hudson Bay freeze before heading out to hunt for seals. Several tour operators offer excursions in adapted vehicles out into the Arctic tundra, with one-day trips or longer expeditions available. It’s not just polar bears that make this a once-in-a-lifetime trip either, because Churchill is also one of the best places in the world to see the northern lights. A two-for-one deal, if you will.Spend a night at the Hotel de Glace in QuebecPerfect for: stepping out of your comfort zoneDrive a few hours out of the historic Quebec city and you’ll find a hotel that’s a little on the chilly side of things. Why? Because it’s made out of ice. You’ll need to time your stay within a very specific window though: Hôtel de Glace is constructed in January and melts away in March each year. Because, you know, ice. With 44 rooms, a chapel, ice bar and even slides, this construction is a work of art and engineering as well as a place to rest your head (day visitors also welcome). Don’t worry about freezing in your sleep either – while the various sofas, chairs and tables are carved out of ice, beds feature soft (and warm!) mattresses, with duvets to boot.Catch and eat lobster in Atlantic CanadaPerfect for: foodiesWhen it comes to Nova Scotia, it doesn’t get more authentic than heading out into the waters of the North Atlantic with an experienced fisherman to catch your own lobster, before enjoying an on-board seafood boil. If fishing isn’t your thing, you can still enjoy the rewards without the work – especially if you’re planning to visit in February, which sees Nova Scotia’s South Shore Lobster Crawl festival take place along the shore each year. A lobster-lover’s dream, it includes an abundance of events, including the best lobster roll challenge. Yum.Visit Iceberg Alley on the Newfoundland coastPerfect for: lovers of the natural worldFerryland, an hour south of St John’s, Newfoundland, made headlines in 2017 thanks to a rather unique neighbour, in the form of a giant iceberg. The town is located right on a part of Canada’s east coast known as Iceberg Alley, so-called because hundreds of icebergs that break off in the Arctic float down past the Newfoundland and Labrador from spring to September. And while the behemoth that took up residence on Ferryland’s doorstep was a particularly large example, you can spot these 10,000-year-old glacial giants from many viewing points along the northern and eastern coasts of this province, by boat tour or kayak. You can even track them online.Walk on the ocean floor in the Bay of FundyPerfect for: intrepid explorersFancy going for a walk? How about a stroll along the actual ocean floor? It may sound out-of-this-world, but that doesn’t mean it’s not possible – because in the Bay of Fundy, which lies between the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, you can do just that. It’s all thanks to the unusual variance between low and high tide in the bay, which can exceed 15 metres. At low tide, the ocean floor at the head of the bay is exposed for around three hours, with towering cliffs and sea stacks creating a surreal backdrop to seafloor exploration – which often yields the discovery of fossils, sea glass, and semi-precious stones. Then visit a few hours later to see how fast the water returns.Fly WestJet from London to Canada’s capital cities and have your own Canadian adventure"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbe692aacaa6cff92b06975d8f44d560be532d79/0_172_5733_3442/master/5733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10d481d47ee6dcfdee6a003a012274eb","title":"great for the grid canadas most instagrammable views","story":"Whether it’s Québec City’s gorgeous Rue du Cul-de-Sac, whale watching off the coast of British Columbia or taking in the vast northern expanse of Baffin Island, Canada is full of incomparable photo-opsNo matter if you’re armed with a DSLR or just a trusty iPhone, start planning your trip with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c42d8a78f536e6d3a8047271114fce8278e6552d/19_0_6680_4010/master/6680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b36bbc6db7b5bed78c4a0fafa2c8cab","title":"canadas 10 coolest neighbourhoods in pictures","story":"Canada has a lot more to offer than just breathtaking natural scenery – and there is plenty of that – its thriving cities also happen to be home to some of the hippest, most dynamic neighbourhoods in North America.

The guy I play, Travis Stubbs, works in an office cubicle in the early 90s. He is stuck in a job he hates and not happy about where he is in life, but he has aspirations. He wants to look like a successful businessman but he doesn’t have much style or taste. Bad style in the early 90s gives you a plethora of horrible, horrible outfits. It was one of my favourite characters to create in terms of the look and the hair. It’s always fun when you create a character who looks different from the way they feel. He has bought into a pyramid scheme, so in order to recruit more people he wants to look important and successful. We had a lot of fun putting together some ostentatious and quite tacky outfits, culminating in a very ill-fitting tuxedo.Going to costume fittings is always instrumental, for me, in finding the character. I spend hours thinking: “What kind of shoe would this guy wear? What kind of jacket?” It’s always a collaboration between me and the costume designer and I will agonise over an outfit – if I find a great pair of shoes, but they are slightly the wrong colour, that can bother me a lot.In my personal life, I don’t pay much attention to what I wear – it’s the other end of the spectrum and I like to just switch off. I don’t have the energy to spend more than two minutes thinking about it in the morning and so I pretty much wear the same thing every day. That is not to say I’m not interested in clothes – it can be fun to dress up for an event – but that’s a special occasion. I never “put together an outfit” if I’m just running around New York or Stockholm.

Until then Dinamo Zagreb had stymied England’s champions, yet 10 minutes after entering Sterling had a 10th goal in 12 appearances and City were cruising to a second victory and had Group C in their control.The forward completed a scintillating cameo by creating Phil Foden’s second on 95 minutes.Guardiola made five changes from the victory at Everton. Kevin De Bruyne was omitted due to a groin problem – his availability for the visit of Wolves on Sunday is in the balance – while Bernardo and David Silva, Benjamin Mendy, João Cancelo and Sergio Agüero all came in. Sterling, Gabriel Jesus, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Kyle Walker were the others to drop out.Zagreb had won their previous match 4-0 on Friday and arrived hoping to end a dismal streak of 12 consecutive losses in Champions League away group games. Guardiola’s wish that City fans be “seduced” by the competition was not answered during the pre-game anthem, which was booed as has become customary at the Etihad, and the contest was stopped almost instantly following kick-off when Rodri fell awkwardly. This may have affected City’s rhythm because they were slow to settle, with one needlessly loose pass from Agüero indicative of the wider problem.Guardiola had again plumped for the centre-back pairing of Fernandinho and Nicolás Otamendi but neither they nor the rest of the defence could stop Dino Peric rising to head at Ederson’s goal from a free-kick. The effort went too high.Yet action in the visitors’ area was served up on a near-permanent loop until half-time, Agüero repeatedly receiving the ball and looking to fire a shot off or find Riyad Mahrez.What kept the score level was a dogged Dinamo rearguard and the referee’s refusal to award a penalty when Kévin Théophile-Catherine seemed to handball near goal. The latter incident was surely an example of what VAR is supposed to clear up but Nenad Bjelica’s team were allowed to escape. Seconds later, David Silva also thought he had a decent penalty shout but Serdar Gözübüyük was again not interested in awarding the kick. By the interval, City had somehow failed to breach Dominik Livakovic’s goal though Guardiola’s instructions may have been to simply keep on keeping on, given his team’s dominance.What the manager will not have suggested was for Rodri to begin the second half by giving the ball up for Bruno Petkovic to run clear towards Ederson. But as his teammates waited to be played in the No 9 dawdled and the danger fizzled out.Zagreb soon committed their own howler, a mix-up between Peric and Livakovic letting the ball spill to Agüero, who could not quite capitalise as the angle tightened. Next, a slick City corner ended with Ilkay Gündogan chipping the ball to the back post towards a lurking Agüero before Livakovic cleared with a punch.Eleven minutes into the second period Guardiola had seen enough, and he took off the muted Bernardo Silva for Sterling in an attempt to find the killer touch that had been absent. City camped in the final third but frustration grew as the yellow wall put up by Croatia’s champions remained firm. That was until, at last, the hosts made the breakthrough when Sterling hammered home a precise Mahrez cross and Guardiola celebrated with the home support.The manager’s decision to bring on Sterling had gained City the ascendancy they deserved. What they did not receive was a penalty when Petar Stojanovic took Sterling down – but the decision looked correct, Stojanovic connecting with ball first. It did however spark a Guardiola tantrum and the Catalan was booked – much to his chagrin. This, though, ended as a satisfying evening for him and his side, capped when Sterling broke clear to set up Foden, the midfielder slotting coolly home in the closing moments.Of the 19-year-old, who has never been selected for a senior England squad, Sterling said: “I am buzzing for Phil and I want him in the national team, if he keeps going he will be there.” It is indicative of City’s depth that Foden is not yet a regular in their XI."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff81dfa73369675e2d2d78ec0fd6532a8eed1453/74_4_4032_2418/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3dc81fc566ef800d46e25dfe010eec1","title":"real madrid club brugge champions league","story":"Long after the final whistle had gone here, Club Brugge’s fans were still singing high in the north stand, their players back out on the pitch celebrating with them. This was a big occasion and a big result for the Belgians and yet, while there were no signs of regret, they knew it could have been even bigger. For most of a night their coach, Philippe Clement, described as “historic” they had led with two goals from Emmanuel Bonaventure, but headers from Sergio Ramos and Casemiro, the latter in the 86th minute, had seen it end level.The rest of the stadium stood empty, Madrid’s fans making their way home knowing that it could have been worse: for them too, this finishing 2-2 was a success, given where they had come from.What Madrid might have expected to be a routine victory became a rescue mission. For a long time, they had been on course for a second defeat in the Champions League that arrived in a way that could have hurt even more than the first: to begin with, this was silly at the Santiago Bernabéu, then it got worse, the home side not so much shooting themselves in the foot as blowing their entire leg off. Then the comeback came, but it remained only half-completed, avoiding defeat but not securing victory. Madrid, who have never been knocked out in the group stages, have a solitary point after two matches.It could and perhaps should have been nought. Not only were they behind until late on, they were almost caught right at the death, even though Brugge were by then down to 10 and without their captain.Brugge had been ahead from the ninth minute, although it took a further three for them to know that. Percy Tau was played in up the left and, with Madrid wide open, he put the ball across for Bonaventure who was racing through the middle. What happened next was, frankly, daft. Alone in front of goal, by the six-yard box, Bonaventure failed to control the ball properly, stumbling and watching it bounce off one leg and then the other, the chance apparently wasted. Only, it wasn’t: the ball dribbled past Thibaut Courtois, already on the floor. So slowly did it go that Madrid’s keeper might even have got up in time to prevent it crossing the line.Courtois, though, couldn’t stop it. The linesman and his referee on the other hand could. Offside was given – and accepted by just about everyone here. Tau had appeared to go unnecessarily early, and so had Bonaventure. On the touchline, Clement literally did a facepalm inspired by how foolishly they had passed up a perfect opportunity. But these are days of video, of routine checks for every goal. And the word came back: onside. Ramos had been the culprit.Brugge led. Madrid were stunned, groggy, and almost caught again. Bonaventure was away, the linesman’s flag stopping his run. This decision may have been wrong too, but Bonaventure had already put on the brakes. Madrid struggled to escape their own stupefaction. Lucas Vázquez was having an especially horrible time. So was Nacho, beaten often by Krépin Diatta. Madrid had the ball, but every time Brugge came out, they looked vulnerable. In fact, had the Belgians taken better decisions, they might have done more damage.They did enough. Luka Modric went down in the area, Toni Kroos’s volley deflected just wide, and Eden Hazard and Karim Benzema got in each other’s way. Benzema’s header was blocked and then Simon Mignolet made a sensational save from Raphaël Varane’s header. But at the other end, the threat always lingered. Courtois had to save from Pau, slipped clean through behind Nacho by Diatta’s measured pass.Kroos then put a shot fractionally wide. That was the best chance, but it was quickly followed by the second goal for Brugge, and in this too Madrid were complicit in their own demise. Modric lost the ball and Bonaventure rushed through, no one in his way as he headed towards goal. As he approached the area, Bonaventure stumbled, on the verge of falling, but he stayed upright just long enough to dink the ball over Courtois, who was already on his way down.Madrid were in pieces the end of the first half was met with furious whistles. Zinedine Zidane acted fast: off went Nacho, replaced by Marcelo. Off too went Courtois, a substitution that some suspected was a statement, cheered by supporters, but that was in fact explained by the goalkeeper’s physical state. During the break, Courtois had been dizzy and vomiting. Alphonse Areola was almost immediately called upon to prevent Bonaventure, clean through and running from deep, from making it three.Relieved, Madrid reacted. Mignolet had made a couple of saves already when, on 55 minutes, Ramos headed in Benzema’s cross. The flag was up and Madrid’s captain looked offside, but the VAR again decided otherwise. Game on, noise up. Brugge had half an hour to hang on. Ruud Vormer flew in to block a shot from Casemiro, Vázquez bent just wide, and Hazard hit past the post from the edge of the box. Vinícius Júnior was introduced. Bonaventure was withdrawn Brugge’s fans applauded and Madrid’s probably felt like doing the same, relieved to see him go.The impetus went too, that fury momentarily fizzing out. Vinícius ran but few real chances followed. There were 27 shots from the home side, but not the danger that number suggests. Then a challenge from Vormer, ing in, caught Vinícius on the ankle. Georgi Kabakov sent Vormer off and from the free-kick Casemiro headed Madrid level. They had six minutes to get another.When Ramos jumped with Mignolet and the ball ran free in the six-yard box, there was a sharp intake of breath, and it felt inevitable that Madrid would score. But they didn’t and in fact, it was Brugge who came closest in those dying minutes. Tau dashed through the middle yet again but did not see the option to pass opening up and was eventually bundled over. From the free-kick, deep into stoppage time, Siebe Schrijvers was suddenly alone deep inside the Madrid area. He had barely been on the pitch a few seconds and he sliced his shot wide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa5ef81d1a2158d55fcb0b927edaba869e59d8dc/0_82_5132_3079/master/5132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc426314f08d1ec1fe6f85f3670ec238","title":"tottenham hotspur bayern munich champions league match report","story":"There were 55 minutes on the stadium clock and a look of pure bewilderment on the faces of Tottenham’s defenders. They had just been shredded for the second time in three minutes by Serge Gnabry, Bayern Munich’s former Arsenal winger and, despite having carried the fight to the Bundesliga champions, they were staring at an irretrievable 4-1 deficit.Remarkably, it was only the beginning of the pain for the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, and his team on a night when serious questions could be asked of their character. It has been a difficult season for them so far, with off-field issues from the summer hanging over into the opening weeks. Pochettino has repeatedly given the impression that he has been fighting with one hand tied behind his back. Here, he could do nothing to stop the onslaught as Gnabry and Bayern twisted the knife.This was Gnabry’s night and he finished it with a four-goal haul, as Spurs wilted shamefully in the closing stages. For his hat-trick, he raced away from Jan Vertonghen to collect a long ball from the substitute Thiago Alcântara. He needed only two touches before he swept past Hugo Lloris and, after Robert Lewandowski had added Bayern’s sixth – the striker’s second of the evening – Gnabry beat Lloris yet again.It is incredible to think that Gnabry once spent an unhappy loan spell at West Bromwich Albion under Tony Pulis in the 2015-16 season. He has developed into a world star since leaving the Premier League and he lit up a pulsating night with his pace and precision.Gnabry’s opening goal was arguably the pick of the bunch the first time he sent shockwaves around the stadium with his acceleration, which took him away from Serge Aurier’s slide tackle on halfway. In what felt like the blink of an eye, he had reached the edge of the Spurs area before he cut inside Toby Alderweireld and buried a shot into the far corner.The result reinforced Bayern’s position at the top of Group B and it left Spurs with only one point from their two ties, after the 2-2 draw at Olympiakos a fortnight ago. They have it all to do in order to reach the knockout rounds for a third season in succession but the more immediate challenge is to come to terms with what was a humiliation. The scars will run deep for some time and the fear is that they could derail their season. In their 137-year history, Spurs have never conceded seven at home and never before have an English team been so badly beaten at home in Europe.It felt like a trick of the imagination that Spurs had taken the lead through Son Heung-min that they were the better team for the first 30 minutes and that Pochettino was not guilty of too much exaggeration when he said that he felt in his most upbeat mood of the season at half-time.Spurs played with tempo at the outset and it was no surprise when Son put them in front, having gone close on two occasions in the early running. Both of those chances were laid on by Tanguy Ndombele, with the first being the clearer one. Son should have scored but he would make amends. Dele Alli pressed Corentin Tolisso and it was Moussa Sissoko who provided the incision. Son’s low finish had too much on it for Manuel Neuer.Gnabry had shot too close to Lloris in the second minute – the first sign of his threat – and, although Bayern equalised through Joshua Kimmich’s beauty from distance, Spurs had their chances in the first half. Harry Kane rounded Neuer only for David Alaba to clear while Ndombele was denied by Neuer after Aurier’s clever pull-back.Lewandowski’s goal on the stroke of half-time was the turning point and, if nothing else, it highlighted the slender nature of the margins at this level. Tolisso won the ball as he lay on the ground and Lewandowski took a touch, spun and fizzed a low shot into the corner from the edge of the area. Lewandowski has scored in every game of Bayern’s season – apart from the German Super Cup defeat against Borussia Dortmund, which has been their only loss. He is a byword for efficiency.Niko Kovac, the Bayern manager, was compassionate in victory, saying that his team had simply taken an unusually high percentage of their chances and it should be noted that, after Kane’s penalty to make it 4-2, Sissoko and the substitute Christian Eriksen went close for Spurs. As strange as it sounds, Pochettino’s players believed they could fight back at that point.Yet it was a Pochettino soundbite that hung heavy in the air. It was the one about his players giving up once Gnabry had completed his hat-trick. It was unacceptable. The boos from the home crowd rang out with feeling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b9a58b342b805f0bc3147a6e4a76b5ad8e15616/45_186_2716_1629/master/2716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3140e095d91b0e41a788524a86e4b4d","title":"tottenham hotspur v bayern munich champions league live","story":"Spurs are stunned 7-2 at home by Bayern Munich after a second-half capitulation in which the German side scored five timesRead Jamie Jackson on Manchester City’s win over Dinamo ZagrebAnd that will do! Wow, what an odd night. Thanks for joining me for it, and see you again soon!“I don’t need too much time to explain. I think we played 30 minuted really really well, really compact and aggressive. Unlucky that we conceded at the end of the first half for 2-1, and of cure after that they were very clinical. I think there’s not very much difference on the attempts but they were very clinical. We scored a penalty and had some chances to score a third but of course we conceded three more goals and it’s a tough, tough result. I think it’s too much and hard to accept this kind of result but that happens when your opponent has so much quality and is so clinical in front of goal. We are very disappointed and upset but need to stay all together.“In this type of situation you need to face it. You need to be strong and keep going. We need to stay all together. The best medicine is to be all together, help each other, not find people guilty. Of course when you receive this type of result it’s important to bounce back and believe in yourselves. That is the only way to recover the good feeling.”Fairly light stuff there, really. Wonder if he’s really feeling that philosophical ...You’ll want to get your hands on this – David Hytner’s report from an extraordinary night:If you’re wondering where any post-match reaction from Pochettino is, we are told that Spurs are “in a meeting”.“Liverpool bounced back from losing a final by winning the whole shebang. Obviously, this is one isolated group match, but it’s hard to see Spurs following that lead,” observes Matt Dony.What impressed me about Bayern there was the way in which, as soon as they scented blood, they went for it. No messing about. Once the third went in it was clear they could streak away.If we hold on a little while we might find out ...An unsparing assessment. It might be the second part, you know. What on earth has gone wrong?In the group’s other game Red Star Belgrade have beaten Olympiakos 3-1, making Spurs’ upcoming double-header with the Serbian side all the more crucial.

Spurs have gone this has been a quite terrible, terrible capitulation and the repercussions may be long-lasting.This is very messy now. Bayern work this beautifully after Alderweireld gives the ball away, Coutinho nudging a delightful first-time pass to Lewandowski with the outside of his foot and the striker finishing devastatingly.86 min: Ultimately, this has been a schooling for Spurs. It’s as if they are an elastic band that’s stretched beyond its limit. How do you get that old tension back?And there’s the proof for you. This is brilliant. Bayern keep the ball, wait their moment and then Thiago springs Gnabry through with a 60-yard ball from deep. His first touch, as it drops, is quite sumptuous and he runs through before finishing with aplomb.81 min: Gnabry has been sensational tonight by the way, and not only for his goals. He looks so, so sharp. World-class. Winks now comes off and Lamela comes on, in Spurs’ next throw.79 min: So gets to the byline but completely messes up a ball back to a teammate. A rare off note from him.77 min: This game has had very, very few flat spells but we are amid one. Spurs need something fast now, and hope Eriksen can provide it but the sub shoots wastefully over from the edge of the area when there are better options.74 min: Coutinho drags one wide and I just wonder if Bayern have rode out that little Spurs flurry now.73 min: Oh, and I missed Perisic coming on for Coman there.72 min: Lucas Moura comes on for the quiet Alli, and Bayern bring on Javi Martinez for Boateng, who seems to be injured and is being helped off.70 min: No, it wasn’t given. Coman was on his way down but there was contact. Not clear and obvious, seemingly, and I’m all for VAR letting refs abide by their own decisions. But I still think Spurs got a bit lucky there ...69 min: It’s very stretched out there now ... and Coman wants a penalty after Rose slides in and seems to take his legs away. Not given and I think that was fortunate. But they’re having another look ...66 min: Lewandowski does brilliantly to surge down the left and tee up Gnabry, whose eyes light up the the hat-trick ... but a combination of Vertonghen and Alderweireld lurches in to make him miscue. Then Eriksen takes aim from 20 yards and forces a brilliant tip from Neuer! That’s a fine save and stops Spurs giving themselves real hope!64 min: Oh, that could have been 4-3. In fairness it’s a difficult, dropping ball 16 yards out for Sissoko and he can’t keep it down. Now Ndombele comes off, after fading following that fine first 30, and here is Eriksen ...63 min: Big 10 minutes or so now. Will Bayern keep hold of things or do Spurs have the wind in their sails?Put away neatly, and now then!! We could have some half-hour ahead of us ...Yes, it’s given. Looked a bit iffy to me. But now they can get back into it through Kane ...Coman clips Rose in the box, and Bayern aren’t happy because his foot was high as he took possession. But Spurs have a lifeline ... I think. VAR check ...58 min: A question, and one I’d have asked before his lapse just then. How good is Harry Winks? I don’t mean “How GOOD is Harry Winks?!?!”. I’m more asking if he’s really a top-level midfielder, or got what it takes to be one. I think he can look really nice but I’m not sure. Oh hold on ...57 min: I’m, errr, not sure what Spurs do now. Of course they try to get back into it. But Bayern are exploiting space ruthlessly and they won’t want this getting any messier.And he’s done it again! Do Bayern think they’re playing Arsenal? Winks is caught on the ball and Bayern are on him like a flash. It’s spirited left to Gnabry, who slots in off the post, and that is the game right there.What a strike this is from the ex-Arsenal man! Just clinical. He gets a run on Alderweireld on the left side after playing a sweet one-two near halfway, cuts inside, feints to shoot and then does – cracking it viciously across Lloris. Long, long way back for Spurs now.50 min: Coutinho sends Lewandowski on a run and Spurs are a bit fortunate that a loose touch invites Alderweireld to clear up. The defender then releases Alli with a wonderful diagonal, but his shot doesn’t really work Neuer too hard.48 min: Vertonghen blocks from Lewandowski and Tolisso shoots wide. Spurs don’t want to concede again.47 min: “Looking at the team sheet I see at least one Bayern substitute who could come in and make a Cuisance of himself,” notes Peter Oh. I’ll let you all scroll down to work that one out.46 min: Kane gets an early yellow for leaving his arm out in an aerial challenge.Bayern bring on Thiago for Alaba, who did get a bit of a clatter earlier.Expectations for the second half? If Spurs can ratchet up the tempo again they could still draw or even win this game, definitely.We’ve got the thriller tonight, so far!Well! Spurs led, were pegged back, could have led again and were full throttle for half an hour. But Bayern seized a measure of control in the latter stages and Lewandowski capitalised brilliantly. All to play for after a rattling good half!It’s been all Bayern for the last 15 minutes and we can’t say this wasn’t coming. Lewandowski is involved early in the move with a quite delicious flick by the right byline, resulting in a penalty claim from Tolisso. But play continues and Lewandowski, by now on the edge of the area, turns and cracks in a lethal low finish!44 min: ... who flops a low one wide, that snicks off the wall. Not worth the two-minute buildup! Anyhow, Bayern do get a corner out of it, defended well by Alderweireld.43 min: Ndombele is booked for fouling Coutinho, who had got to his feet very quickly from a previous challenge and retrieved the ball. It’s in a brilliant position for Bayern and the numerous players who would fancy this one. Looks like Lewandowski ...41 min: Gnabry forces Lloris to beat away a meaty cross-shot, and Spurs still can’t really get out at the moment.39 min: A Bayern corner from the left. They are seeing much more of the ball now. Coutinho’s delivery is good but Spurs flick it away.38 min: Matt Richman writes on Son ...“As a not-Spurs fan, I have to agree with Mr. Ray. Beyond being someone who has yet to have an egregiously negative headline associated with him, he is pacy, has a relentless work ethic, and a direct-but-still-technical style that would make him an asset on literally any team. He’s one of my favourite active players these days I just wish he wore a different shirt.”36 min: A continuation of this good Bayern patch sees Alderweireld crane his neck crucially to stop Kimmich’s dink reaching Lewandowski.35 min: Coman fizzes one wide of Lloris’s left post now. Bayern, after a rocky spell, have come back into it.33 min: Lewandowski barges Winks off the ball fairly in midfield and suddenly Bayern look awash with possibility ... until Sissoko comes back and blocks Coman off well. Then Alaba crosses and Lewandowski heads well wide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d563450700aeea16eaf3c85f71fab7c17545673/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7282e8587bbb57ff83a61284d9638dd0","title":"the rise of monarchism","story":"Some are searching for a return to tradition, some are yearning for stability, while for others the rise of Trump is the spurSean wasn’t always a monarchist. The history graduate student, who’s in his early 20s, grew up Catholic in central Massachusetts in what he described as “a pretty staunch Republican household”. But in college, a love of history, particularly the Roman Empire, ultimately drew him to monarchism and away from what he described as the “rah-rah American republicanism” of his childhood.“Most people tend to get more liberal in college,” he told me. While earning his undergraduate degree at a Catholic liberal arts school close to where he grew up, he explained: “I ended up looking into medieval political theory and getting more conservative. The monarchies I find most interesting and think we should replicate go back to the late Middle Ages.”Sean’s views shifted not only thanks to his medieval studies, but also after learning more about US foreign policy.“Having a background in history, I naturally gravitated toward monarchism because I felt that my national government wasn’t looking at issues of public welfare or national coherence or national unity,” he said. “Our political system has been irrevocably poisoned by political partisanship.”I connected with Sean through the message boards of rmonarchism, a growing and erse community of monarchy-lovers on Reddit that boasts almost 10,000 members, and touts itself as “a forum for those who think monarchy is a noble and viable alternative to the crude and materialistic mob mentality of republicanism”. These message boards feature a glut of inspirational images of various monarchs: King George VI going down a slide, Swedish King Carl XVI Gustav, Prince William and his family, and Tsar Nicholas II.Monarchism is still active in around 40 countries, and whatever you may think of the practice, Sean’s analysis of the brokenness of our system is spot on. In the United States, the political atmosphere has been totally spoiled by radical isiveness – a fact exacerbated by Donald Trump’s ascent into the Oval Office. The notion that something is deeply wrong with how our government works is inescapable, so it’s no surprise that people are searching for alternative ideologies.When you think of monarchy, you might think of an inbred Habsburg – the family’s distinctive jaw, how generations of rulers crippled by a variety of diseases due to their tendency to marry within the immediate family. But for Sean and other members of the subreddit, monarchism is not merely about having a supreme ruler and an inherited throne. Most members of the community deplore authoritarian regimes. They aren’t simply searching for order via a supreme leader, but a return to tradition. “A monarchy is based around the nation showing respect for its past, its people and the culture,” one Reddit user explained.Of course, there are many different kinds of monarchists. There are the absolutists who tend to favor hereditary supreme rule, and there are those who think the ideal form of government is close to what Great Britain has right now (a democracy paired with a monarch who serves a ceremonial role as head of state).For an American monarchist like Sean, his preferred system of government “is some manner of elective monarchy modeled to a degree after what you saw in the Holy Roman Empire”, he told me. “The inidual governor of each of the 50 states could vote amongst themselves on a new monarch in the event of an emperor stepping down … One of the reasons that I, and many others, favor monarchy, has to do with the benefits that a single inidual can have when it comes to matters of foreign policy, international relations, international trade, et cetera.”Others were drawn to monarchy more explicitly because of Trump. One self-identified American semi-constitutionalist explained: “I always had some monarchist sympathies, but I went full turncoat when I saw how moronically people were treating politics after 2016 and realized that our current system was breeding a bunch of nutjobs. After that I became convinced that a monarch or something is needed to keep politicians and the like in check.”“Historical amnesia,” Sean Yom, an associate professor of political science at Temple University told me, when I asked him what might possess someone to become a monarchist in 2019. “There’s a collective amnesia about how bad certain kinds of political systems really were.” Yom specifically studies contemporary Middle Eastern monarchies, and noted that many of the participants in the subreddit seemed to be “from fairly developed western countries where the notion of monarchism wrapped largely in warm historical overtones”.In 2018, the New York Times cited a study conducted by a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, which discovered “‘robust and quantitatively meaningful evidence’ that monarchies outperform other forms of government”, and provide nations with “stability that often translates into economic gains”.“I think it’s nostalgia,” Mauro Guillen, the Wharton professor who conducted the study, told me when I asked him why monarchy would appeal to a modern-day American or German. “They like the pomp and circumstance,” he said. “Maybe they’re traditionalists, and they like something that provides continuity.” He also pointed out that Hollywood, and specifically Disney, with its famous princesses, has been culturally influential when it comes to the public perception of a monarchical government.But the simple yearning for stability is a big reason why people who are not octogenarian royals are embracing this form of government. “When I was younger I thought monarchy was stupid and made no sense, like most children who were raised on republican (not the American political party) propaganda,” one Reddit user explained to me. “I can’t remember a specific moment when I thought for the first time, ‘monarchy is the best form of government,’ it was just a gradual change. Why am I a monarchist? I’m a monarchist because I believe that monarchy produces a stable government and unites a people, it produces leaders who were taught from birth to lead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c83f9e790c654830a301c489f6565d59501ba3b7/0_953_2657_1593/master/2657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3ae82ef8ddb5b4ce0fc633ac03e10d3","title":"democracy at a low point bishop tells judges at ceremony","story":"Rt Rev Dame Sarah Mullally refers to Brexit ‘chaos and confusion’ as legal year opens British democracy is at one of its “low points” and the government’s justice policy is letting “prisons proliferate”, the bishop of London has said at the formal opening of the legal year.Delivering the sermon in Westminster Abbey on Tuesday, the Rt Rev Dame Sarah Mullally referred to the “chaos and confusion” of the Brexit crisis and praised Magna Carta for holding the king – and by implication the executive – to account.The annual ceremony for the start of the legal year was held a week after the supreme court handed down its unanimous 11-strong judgment that Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks at the height of the Brexit crisis was unlawful.Hundreds of the UK’s most senior judges in their traditional wigs and scarlet and ermine, purple-embroidered or blue-lapelled robes thronged the abbey for the hour-long service.The lord chancellor and justice secretary, Robert Buckland, gave the first reading on Solomon’s judgment. The biblical king’s threat to cut a disputed baby in two was probably not intended to come across as a modern parable for the Conservative party.But Mullally’s sermon required less interpretation. Recalling the prophet Amos, who declared, “Let justice roll down like a mighty stream”, she said: “I don’t think he really meant let police forces expand, let prisons proliferate, let criminals get their just desserts.“Justice in the Bible is less to do with conviction of the guilty and more to do with the care of the innocent,” she said. Scripture was more concerned with “widows, orphans and aliens – the vulnerable”.She continued: “The rule of law in this country has arisen out of this biblical tradition. The concern of the law with justice … law holds the powerful to account and protects the vulnerable.“Interestingly, the 61st clause of Magna Carta, known as the security clause, declared that a council of 25 barons be created with power to overrule the will of the king by force if necessary …“Sometimes, as human leaders, we get it wrong. The wisdom of Solomon in our reading gives way later to Solomon’s folly where he has 700 wives, 300 concubines and sacrifices to false gods.“Likewise, for all the high points of British democracy, there are low points, too. Arguably our present situation is one of them. Filled with chaos and confusion, it is one in which wisdom is required.”Her comments came as the charity Inquest, which supports relatives at coroners’ courts, released figures exposing the low level of legal support for those whose family members died while in the care of state bodies.The figures, obtained through Freedom of Information (FoI) requests by BBC Radio 4’s File on 4 programme, show that last year £41,265 was granted by the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) towards the legal fees of families’ representation for those who had died in police custody.By contrast, the 32 police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that replied showed their legal bills for the inquests came to nearly £410,000 – 10 times the amount granted for families’ legal costs.Julie’s Mental Health Foundation submitted similar FoI requests to 53 mental health trusts in England asking how much they spent on lawyers at inquests in the financial year 2017-18.Among the 26 trusts that responded, expenditure on legal representation at inquests was around £4m. In the same year the LAA paid a total of £118,000 towards fees for legal representation at inquests for families following the death of a relative in contact with mental health services.Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said: “Inquests following state-related deaths are intended to seek the truth and expose unsafe practices. Yet families face state lawyers funded at public expense who work together to limit the remit and put defence of their interests above the search for the truth.“This inequality of arms is the single greatest obstacle to bereaved families … the shocking statistics highlighting the disparities between funding for bereaved families and public authorities show why urgent reform is needed.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1278ca8f9705e50461f23da3d962bb6d0d567cc/214_120_5461_3277/master/5461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=304699527f5e80144f245aac4fcaefab","title":"bob marleys london home gets one of few blue plaques for black artists","story":"Plaque at Chelsea house where reggae star lived in the 70s one of ‘unacceptably low’ number Benjamin Zephaniah was a schoolboy when he sent a letter to Bob Marley along the lines of: “I’m a poet from Birmingham, nobody’s really listening to me in England, what do you think of my poems?”Incredibly, the reggae star wrote back and told him: “Young man, Britain needs you. Keep doing what you do.”Marley’s handwritten letter from Jamaica was one reason Zephaniah was where he was, he said on Tuesday, as he unveiled an English Heritage blue plaque on the house in Chelsea where the singer lived in 1977.“That was a real inspiration to me,” said Zephaniah. “It really inspired me to keep doing what I was doing … at the time there was no spoken word poetry, there was no dub poetry so to read those words...”The plaque is on the front of 42 Oakley Street, a house where Marley lived with his band the Wailers for a short time in the late 70s. When they were not recording they would make the short trip over the Albert Bridge to play football in Battersea Park.It was while living in Oakley Street that Marley and the Wailers finished recording Exodus, the album which featured Jamming, Three Little Birds, Waiting in Vain and One Love.Zephaniah said he was a fan of Marley when it was not so fashionable. “Certainly the Rastafarian community thought I was a bit soft. They were listening to Burning Spear and all the heavy stuff, but I liked the songs and poetry of Bob Marley. Take away the music and you get poetry.”About 12 blue plaques are unveiled in London by English Heritage every year, celebrating figures from history. Seven doors up from Marley is one marking the Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott. Across the road, at number 87, is a plaque for the Irish nationalist poet Jane Wilde, Oscar’s mother.Other music stars of Marley’s generation with blue plaques include Jimi Hendrix, in Mayfair, John Lennon, in Marylebone, and Freddie Mercury, in Feltham.The historian David Olusoga, a trustee of English Heritage and a blue plaques panel member, said the organisation was well aware the figure was “unacceptably low”.He added: “Bob Marley’s plaque is testament to how our scheme is changing, as English heritage continues to work to overcome the obstacles that have led to this underrepresentation.”English Heritage said there were a number of reasons for the low figure, including a low number of nominations and the frequent lack of historic records linking a person to a building in which they lived.Marley is a case in point. His plaque became stuck in the planning process because he was not on the electoral register or in the phone book and getting firm evidence was tricky.Researchers did, however, discover a court record of Marley’s arrest for cannabis possession in 1977, along with bassist Aston ‘Family man’ Barrett. Barrett’s address was 42 Oakley Street while Marley’s was given as 27 Collingham Gardens.Anecdotal evidence has suggested Marley gave a different address to prevent the police from searching the house in Oakley Street for drugs and getting more people in trouble.Olusoga said Marley was one of the most recognisable people to have ever lived. “What mattered to millions of people was not just that he was an undoubted musical genius, but that he was somebody who came from a life like theirs. He had been born into poverty. To millions of people in the developing world he was the first global figure from their background.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6bd84eb1acec86c3be0aa60c66d5544910b6ad6/0_939_2686_1611/master/2686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a9f83a9a2822d8f60e35cc0e02067e6","title":"jessye norman american soprano stars legend","story":"She was a a so grand she needed to Rolls Royce just to get across the street. Martin Kettle kicks off stars’ tributes to the great American sopranoJessye Norman’s voice was a force of nature, a gift from the gods. When you went to hear her sing, you always knew exactly what you would get. Sumptuous, creamy and voluptuous tone was Norman’s trademark, along with a meticulous attention to text and expression. For some, it was all too grand and undifferentiated, like a meal in which the richness of the food was overwhelming and unchanging in every course. But the sheer vocal splendour that Norman produced was the sort of sound that comes only once in a lifetime.Yet Norman was not just an unforgettable voice. She was an unforgettable public presence – an African American presence – in every event in which she participated. The knowingness that marked her vocal art extended seamlessly to her public conduct. Her choices on Desert Island Discs did not include her own recordings (which, given her personality, they might easily have done) but Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech. She was a majestic figure in every sense, and she knew from the start of her career to the end that she was also an embodiment of her black brothers and sisters. She would never be anybody’s second-class citizen. And she never was.Norman was not the breakthrough African American singer of 20th-century America. Those imperishable accolades belonged to Marian Anderson and, a little later, to Leontyne Price, who each made the breaches in the whites-only world of classical music and opera. But she was in every way Price’s successor as the flag carrier for her people in the concert halls and opera houses of the US and the wider world. Like Price, she came from the south and developed her voice in church choirs. But, perhaps even more than Price, Norman embraced her iconic status in wider American life as an integral part of the gift she possessed.Norman’s operatic career had to take account of both her vocal richness and her substantial height. She never possessed an athletic stage presence, and she was not really an ensemble actor. The roles that suited her best were often statuesque, where her character’s emotional presence was able to dominate. Her Elizabeth in Wagner’s Tannhäuser and, in particular, her Cassandre in Berlioz’s Les Troyens, which she sang at Covent Garden, were characterisations of this kind. Later, she excelled in the title role of Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos, to which the tragic dignity of her vocal breadth was perfectly suited. Though she sang Mozart with total commitment, her voice was simply too big and her personality too grand to fit into such quicksilver writing.Stories of Norman’s imperious behaviour were common in the musical world. She could be uncompromising about the standards she expected from herself and others. And she was said to require to be collected in a Rolls Royce. But she never lost her lofty status as a great artist. When Herbert von Karajan, another difficult and imperious personality, was preparing for what was likely to be his final appearance at the Salzburg festival, it was Norman he wanted by his side, to sing Isolde’s Liebestod.Concerts were Norman’s ideal milieu, especially as her career entered its final years. Her range was great. She sang everything from art songs to spirituals. She was magnificent in large choral works, such as Schoenberg’s Gurrelieder under Pierre Boulez in the Proms at the Albert Hall. But she was the go-to singer for the great public American occasion, notably the presidential inaugurations of Ronald Reagan (about which, as a Democrat, she had trepidation) and later Bill Clinton. There may not have been many operas for which Norman was the ideal choice, but she was in every sense a larger than life and irreplaceable artist.‘An unflinching connection to the eternal’Rufus Wainwright, singersongwriterRarely do all the essential elements of the performing arts combine in one human being. Stature, intelligence, a sense of movement, attention to detail, generosity to the public and above all that voice. All of these plus a little bit of magic imbued La Norman with what I love most about opera: a solid and unflinching connection to the eternal. Thank you Jessye for lighting the path to the universe.‘After dinner, she put on an apron and did the dishes’Clive Gillinson, artistic director of Carnegie Hall, New YorkI got to know Jessye 50 years ago when I was a player, and then managing director, at the London Symphony Orchestra. We became friends: she had a house in London, and used to invite people round for the most spectacular dinners. She did the cooking and then we’d stand round the sink while she put on an apron and did the washing up! I remember also going dancing at Annabel’s with her – she was an incredible dancer. Very flamboyant, as you would expect.When I came to New York, one of the first things I did was develop citywide arts festivals, and I went to her home in upstate NY to ask if she would curate one on African American culture. I was nervous as I knew how busy she was, but she said to me: “Clive, I’ve been waiting my entire life to do this project.” She threw herself into it with incredible passion, thought and care – which was how she approached everything. ‘A big personality with a magnetic presence’Lawrence Brownlee, tenorHer musicality, her versatility, her eloquence in many languages and her standing in the world of classical music made Jessye Norman an icon and a role model for every singer of any nationality and any colour. But for me, as a young black American singer, she inspired me and gave me belief and hope that I could be successful too. As an established singer, I met her several times. She invited me to give a recital at the school she helped set up – the Jessye Norman School of the Arts in her home town of Augusta, Georgia.Over dinner I discovered that she had been following my career, and even knew which show I was in. We kept in touch and she continued to watch and support me. She was at a stage in her life when she didn’t need to pay it forward, but she did, always. She was effusive in her compliments and really cared about me. She wanted to encourage me and my peers and see us succeed.She was undeniably a big personality, a magnetic and strong presence on stage. She was one of the last remaining as, a very bold singer who brought commitment and charisma to everything she did. She was one of the greatest of her generation in German repertoire, but what I love about her was that as a musician she simply wanted to communicate. She dealt with racism, and she talked about people not wanting to give her her dues, but she was extremely resilient and focused. She let her voice speak for her.‘She wasn’t going to let anyone stop her’Judith Weir, composerWe worked together on a song cycle, woman.life.song, that was at the Proms in 2000. It’s a project she dreamed up and was very intimately involved in the nitty gritty of shaping over the several years it took to develop. I remember she would send me very businesslike but charming faxes – now alas too faded to read. I wish I’d photographed them.I found her extremely professional, well informed and a joy to work with. I know she had a reputation for being a a, but that was not my experience. She spent so much of her life on the road that I think her exacting demands (about, say, air conditioning) were born of her experiences of what could have and had gone wrong. At the Proms, I remember being struck by the audience she had brought in – it was the first time I’d seen so many people of colour there. Thank goodness things are changing now, but she was about 20 years ahead of her time. She knew that boundaries, whether of colour or gender, had to be broken and she wasn’t going to let anyone stop her.‘Wide open spaces shrank in her hands’Iain Burnside, pianistI never saw a singer dominate a space the way Jessye could. The wide open spaces of the Royal Festival Hall shrank in her hands. Every gesture, vocal and physical, carried to the back wall. I treasure her incredible spun line in Strauss’s Wiegenlied and her power in Zueignung. Her high-cheekboned smile will never be surpassed. She conveyed joy like no one else. A couple of years ago, I met her at a dinner and drove her back to her hotel. She squeezed my leg as she said thank you and I thought that my life was complete.‘Despite the odds, she commanded attention’Sir Willard White, bass baritoneShe approached everything she did, every role, with total commitment. She commanded attention, despite all the odds – in a way, she was actually inspired by the odds. She set such a high standard that she was intimidating and inspiring at the same time. Of her recordings, I would single out her Four Last Songs for its elegance and beauty. She showed how it should be done.‘Jessye will live on in our hearts’ Joyce DiDonato, mezzo sopranoThe voice was instantly recognisable, the phrasing supreme, the persona larger than life, and the impact eternal. Jessye’s onstage legacy will remain with us all, but her impact off stage changed lives and will continue to live on through her towering example, mentorship, leadership and passion. She will live on in our hearts for ever.• Interviews by Imogen Tilden"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f6bd3340dff3c4350e0cfd48c90cd8f76b5638f/0_130_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3edaf42592fbdc3d145b92554c825042","title":"jessye norman life in pictures","story":"Singing with Jon Bon Jovi, performing La Marseillaise in Paris, receiving a medal from Obama … we remember the many sides of the great American opera singer, who has died aged 74"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dd571c3f328731f92c7ab96a6bd50aa80177f6/0_0_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a974970140b8c194c5d8aff7cd26563c","title":"is it over for justin trudeau podcast","story":"The Canadian prime minister achieved a historic victory in 2015 but as he nears the end of his first term a series of scandals are making his political future less certain.

She was picked up on mic saying sternly: “No disposable coffee cups”, to which a crestfallen Johnson uttered “oh, oh, oh” as his drink was swiped from under his nose. Later in the day, the prime minister tweeted: “Got my coffee in the end” alongside a picture of him holding a Get Brexit Done mug.All eyes will be on Johnson’s conference speech at 11.40am.

Too quiet. After more than two and a half days in a drug-induced coma, the Conservative party conference was slowly dying on its feet. One minister after another making a second-rate speech to a disengaged audience. Everyone in a state of denial that things could fall apart at any time.Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the 66-year-old treasurer of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, had merely been biding his time. You can just imagine how he did it: locked and loaded and buzzing with amphetamines, bursting into the international lounge with another guest.“Er, does your friend have a pass,” the security guard inquired.“Don’t you know who I am?” Geoff snapped. “You’ll never take me alive.”“Show me your pass.”“There will never be a border post here. I will not surrender.”In the life and death struggle that ensued, Psycho Geoff was finally overpowered and subdued. Police and paramedics were summoned, while a huge crowd of journalists looked on. It had been by far the most interesting thing that had happened throughout the entire conference. Thirty minutes later, Geoff was sent home. On the proviso he didn’t tell any other MPs, otherwise they’d all be getting tooled up. Anything to get away.Less than an hour after one of the party’s senior MPs had been brought to heel by a gang of coppers and kicked out, the afternoon session on law and order began in the main hall. Sometimes the political sketch can only be a transcription service. Last year’s conference break-out star, Geoffrey Cox, had been billed to speak but the attorney general has since been exiled for giving the government duff legal advice and the audience had to make do with the more mediocre talent of junior minister Kit Malthouse.“The 20,000 increase in police numbers will be the biggest expansion since …” the hapless Malthouse’s voice tailed away. Since the Tories had cut police numbers by 20,000 nine years ago. Priti Patel emerged to make her first conference speech as home secretary as if she was hosting a TV awards ceremony. All sparkly eyes and Colgate smiles. Ting! It was just a shame that she fought a losing battle with the autocue. Her dimness is a thing of wonder. Sentences died away, to be followed by long pauses. There were no gags because Priti doesn’t do gags. Not effective enough. She much prefers nooses.“Today, here in Manchester, the Conservative party takes its rightful place as the Party of Law and Order in Britain once again,” she began. Er … run that past us again, Priti. Psycho Geoff on his way home to the Cotswolds in the back of a police car under armed guard. The prime minister has been accused of groping two women at the same time and channelling public funds to a woman with whom he had an affair. The government judged by the supreme court to have acted unlawfully over prorogation. The full-on search to find a way of getting round the Benn Act. Mark Francois committing crimes against his own sanity. Right now, it was harder to find someone in the Tory party without serious form.And … smile. Patel carried on. She was going to clamp down on foreigners. Because the very idea of a home secretary with immigrant parents was totally unthinkable. And she’d be chucking out Sajid Javid. Not because he had Asian parents, but because he was a bit rubbish. “When it comes to the intelligence services … what can I say?” she continued. As it happened, nothing. Intelligence and Priti aren’t often found in the same sentence.The biggest irony lay in the subtext. The bottom line was there seemed to be no law that Patel would not break to get the UK out of the EU. Boris and the constitution could have a free pass. Brexit trumped everything. Whatever it took. Even starving out the Irish. The speech wasn’t about the rule of law: it was pure populism. She just about refrained from bringing back hanging but she left it open as a possibility. That could wait till next year. Come to think of it, maybe it was time to build some amphitheatres and feed remainers to the lions.There was no place for the north London metropolitan liberal elite, Priti insisted. Her smile still intact. That didn’t sound like good news for Boris or Dominic Cummings. Not that she cared. She ended her speech with a prayer to Margaret Thatcher. Where there is love, let me sow hatred. This drew the loudest applause of the entire conference. For all her faults, Thatcher would be turning in her grave.As she left the stage, the PA system played “She’s so Priti, oh so Priti … she’s va-cant.” Psycho Geoff meanwhile contemplated his first night in solitary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b14f5e90dfab3b57c58faf019e7d563e7e5a39ee/0_89_2978_1788/master/2978.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0e54fdcab8a0459c04c472ad4207bdf","title":"gary kirsten ecb england head coach cricket","story":"Gary Kirsten will meet with the England and Wales Cricket Board on Wednesday to outline his vision for the men’s national team and its vacant head coach position.The former South Africa opener, 51, has emerged as the leading candidate for the role given a coaching CV that includes taking both his home country and India to No 1 in the Test rankings, as well as overseeing the latter’s World Cup win in 2011.Kirsten has been reluctant to coach at international level since leaving the South Africa post in 2013 due to travel demands and time away from home. He has predominantly operated on the Twenty20 circuit since but has gone through England’s future tours programme and decided he can make it work.Ashley Giles, the director of England cricket, is overseeing the process to find a replacement for Trevor Bayliss and previously stated the new head coach will be able to miss some series amid a hectic schedule, allowing the assistants to take charge for short spells and further their own experience.Giles had previously stated his preference for an Englishman, with Chris Silverwood, the current fast bowling coach, considered another frontrunner due to his previous title-winning experience at Essex. Surrey’s Alec Stewart has also been linked, so too England’s batting coach, Graham Thorpe. Graham Ford, the South African coach of Ireland, is another known to have been sounded out.With Eoin Morgan committed to leading the limited-overs sides for another 12 months at least – the T20 World Cup next year in Australia is the new goal – the focus for Giles is now finding the ideal candidate to support Joe Root in Test cricket and build a side that can regain the Ashes in 202122.Silverwood and Thorpe are expected to take charge for the upcoming tour of New Zealand regardless, having been pencilled in on an interim basis and squads for the five Twenty20 internationals and two Test matches already selected.Should Kirsten land the job, he would not be free until December’s trip to South Africa due to a previously-agreed commitment with Durban Heat in the country’s Mzansi Super League.However, England could yet buy him out of that contract to speed up his arrival, while they would also need to find a replacement head coach for the Cardiff-based team in the Hundred – a role Kirsten signed up to back in August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb720c75954c5cfafde825f4e6fe1ba21455be36/0_267_3834_2300/master/3834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e1bea9b7d8395e55e0778c4800006b0","title":"manu tuilagi england rugby world cup","story":"His teammates call him “Chief” but for Manu Tuilagi there are only a few weeks left in which to rule the world. He sounds pretty sure this will be his final World Cup, even though he is just 28. “I’ll be too old, mate,” he murmured, asked about the possibility of him being involved in 2023. “I feel it.”Opponents, however, should not breathe too deep a sigh of relief. According to John Mitchell, England’s assistant coach, Tuilagi has the air of someone with “a bit of unfinished business” in a white jersey. “He has a real presence and looks like he has real strength and belief both in the team and himself,” Mitchell said after England had worked up a training-ground sweat in front of 600 locals and children on a hot, humid morning.The pool game against Argentina on Saturday will also revive memories of the days when Tuilagi was young, carefree and not yet spending half his life on a treatment table. His World Cup debut was against the Pumas in Dunedin in 2011, after which he received a £5,000 fine for wearing an illegal gumshield. Few imagined then that he would still be waiting to taste victory in a World Cup knockout fixture eight years later.Hence why Tuilagi, whose father is a chief of the family’s Samoan village, is assuming nothing in Japan. The big man cuts a more mature figure these days, with his ferry-jumping days now dipped in sepia, and knows he can never resuscitate his 20-year-old self. “I could never be the old me again. It’s different now. The old me used to just go out and play. Now I need to warm up for 30 minutes before I even start.”His lengthy injury absences have also taught him to relish whatever rugby experiences he has left. “I know that it is not going to last for ever, that it is not going to last very long so I have got to enjoy the moment while it is here.” For that simple reason he says he enjoys playing for England “more now than before” and his coaches are seeing as much on the training field.Mitchell also reckons fatherhood has mellowed the Leicester centre and that he is now ready to make up for lost time. “I think he is in a particularly good space because he is being managed well. He is also just that much older. He has been through a few rugby movies in his time and knows this stage doesn’t always come around. He’s a difficult tackle for anyone and he can also spook players through his defensive pressure. If he gets you man and ball it’s not that comfortable for the attack.”Tuilagi, however, is keen to play down the “unfinished business” tag, preferring to discuss the collective midfield threat he believes England can pose. There is no official confirmation as yet but it seems all but certain George Ford, Owen Farrell and Tuilagi will line up alongside each other against the Pumas. For the latter, it would be a perfect combination. “I love it. We’ve been together for a long time so we all know how each other plays – our strengths and our weaknesses. I’ve played a few games now alongside Fordy and Farrell and their knowledge of the game is unbelievable. I try and stay as close to them as possible. The way they see the game is different level.”Ford, unsurprisingly, also argues that having two 10s in midfield is a plus that England should not abandon now. “To have two like‑minded players on the field who think like 10s – where the space is, doing the right thing at the right time, the kicking and passing options – is a huge strength. I’ve obviously played with Owen through the age groups and a fair bit at senior level so the understanding is good between us.”•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterEngland’s starting XV could also yet contain the fit-again Mako Vunipola if the management decide he is best deployed from the outset opposite his Saracens clubmate Juan Figallo rather than the bench. The Pumas’ strong set-piece may also conceivably bring Courtney Lawes or Mark Wilson into the equation at blindside, although Tom Curry and Billy Vunipola are certain back-row starters.Mitchell, for one, reckons a horses-for-courses selection is the way to go. “Ultimately it comes down to creating the right team mix for this game as opposed to just selecting the best iniduals or the best team. That is very much the way we go about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a9ee67db1849c70e5408426321c77926f4083b4/0_405_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdfd02dafce298b8dadbf433c73ca3cb","title":"sailors toyko team gb olympics","story":"Tokyo has begun to take shape on the horizon for the sailors who became Great Britain’s first athletes to be selected for next summer’s Olympic Games.Twelve sailors will compete across eight disciplines on the waters of Enoshima Harbour as Britain attempts to maintain its place at the top of the all-time sailing medal table. There are places for the 2016 gold medallists Hannah Mills and Giles Scott, as well as Olympians Luke Patience and Stuart Bithell – silver medallists at London 2012 – and Saskia Tidey, who represented Ireland at Rio 2016 but switched allegiance the following year.Speaking at a launch event on the Dorset coast, the venue of sailing events during London 2012, Team GB’s chef de mission, Mark England, said the team was “one of the most talented” in the 120-year history of British Olympic sailing.“The team have been through a rigorous selection process over the last couple of years and whilst it is a blend of newcomers and experienced sailors, it does include within it world champions and four Olympic medallists. We believe it is one of the most talented sailing teams that we’ve ever taken to an Olympic Games.”Sailing has come to the front of the queue in terms of selection in recent cycles. Quota places for Tokyo’s 10 classes were decided in 2018, with qualifying following during the world championships this summer. Selection provides the rubber stamp, with the next 10 months giving necessary time for athletes to practise and plan for conditions in Tokyo.“It’s amazing to be chosen,” said Scott, who will seek to retain his gold in the Finn class. “We were the first named athletes four years ago and we’re the first named this time around. We’re on the leading edge of that Tokyo 2020 rollercoaster. It’s a special thing to be a part of, but we’re all after the same thing and that’s trying to win.“In sailing we only get one spot per nation and there’s only one representative per class,” he went on. “We’re an incredibly strong sailing team and the second or in some classes the third guy in the pecking order are capable of winning medals on the world stage.“So no one gets complacent but equally you need to be able to take a year to focus on one event and get everything in order. Which is why the selection committee and the sailors are always so keen to gain that spot a year out.”Scott has a busy year ahead as he will also compete in the Americas Cup as part of Ineos Team UK. He admits it will be something of a “balancing act” but believes more success is possible. “I need to make sure that I pay enough attention to each area of my sailing, but it is very doable and it’s been done in the past to great success,” he said.Team GB sailors Giles Scott (men’s Finn) Hannah Mills and Eilidh McIntyre (470 women) Luke Patience and Chris Grube (470 men) Charlotte Dobson and Saskia Tidey (49er FX women) Dylan Fletcher and Stuart Bithell (49er men) Alison Young (Laser Radial women) Emma Wilson (RS: X Women) Tom Squires (RS: X men)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fdf62f54cef0eab06215f3dbc7d8249fefc5a55/360_271_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b5dc8c04243a137b3907bdab75a4c01","title":"tearful adam gemili left empty handed as noah lyles picks up 200m gold","story":"For a few thrilling seconds halfway down the home straight Adam Gemili had a 200m world championships medal locked and loaded. All the 25-year-old needed to do was carry his form through the final 60 metres, usually the best of his race. And then, savagely, lady luck intervened to scupper his dreams yet again.A wobble became a stumble. And a stumble turned a silver or bronze into yet another fourth place finish. Understandably, having seen a first global medal slip through his fingers yet again, the tears started to flow - and so began another brutally honest postmortem.“I am gutted,” said Gemili. “I had it. I lost my balance. I had nothing left at the end. All my form went out of the window. I ran like an amateur, I cannot believe it, I came so close, this was such a good chance. My body feels good, I ran well through the heats. I let it go.”His time of 20.03sec was a season’s best. But it was painfully short of the American Noah Lyles, who celebrated his first world title after coming home in a modest 19.83 sec. Short of the Canadian Andre De Grasse, who took silver in 19.95. And short of the Ecuadorian Alex Quinonez, who came home in 19.98.“I am sorry, I feel like I have let down so many people,” admitted Gemili. “So many people sent me messages. The team know I have been plagued with injuries.”Gemili has had this feeling before. At the 2016 Rio Olympics he finished fourth in the 200m final, three thousands of a second away from bronze.“It’s the same, if not worse than that feeling after Rio because of the story behind it, where I’ve come from after injuries and being written off completely.“To not break 20 seconds is so disappointing and heartbreaking. I had the medal and it slipped out of my hands. Fourth is the same as eighth, the same as 16th. Unless you’re on the podium, who cares?”Still, at least Gemili ended on an upbeat note. “It hasn’t happened today, but it has relit something inside me,” he said. “If I go to Tokyo it’s winnable.”It means that Britain still only has won medal after five days of competition. However Dina Asher-Smith is a penalty kick away from gold in the 200m after yet another potential rival, Elaine Thompson, was ruled out through injury. It means that only four of the top 10 in the world will be in Wednesday’s final - with Asher-Smith fastest of all.“Dina is going to win,” predicted Gemili. “This is the best opportunity for a female sprinter to win a medal. She’s miles apart from everyone. It’s not about if she’s going to win it, it’s about how fast she can go. I’m hoping she can do something really special.”Elsewhere there was an easy victory in the 800m for the Nike Oregon Project athlete Donavan Brazier in a US record 1:42.34, ahead of the Bosnian Amel Tuka and the Kenyan Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich.When Brazier was asked what he knew about Alberto Salazar’s doping ban, he surprised his audience by telling them: “I didn’t actually know the investigation was going on. And he’s not my coach - I’m coached by Pete Julian.”When some put it to him that what had happened might have changed his opinion of Salazar he shook his head. “No. The only contact I’ve had with Alberto has been pleasant. I like Alberto. He’s a cool guy.”And when asked if he would stay with the Oregon Project, he added: “Yeah, if Pete takes control.”Meanwhile a thrilling men’s pole vault competition was won by the American Sam Kendricks, who cleared 5.97m to defeat the Swedish teen sensation Mundo Duplantis to gold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/891c808740ca11b64adc453f5b9679f5f3ec1110/0_241_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e35adbf193b398755876dd6a661c8ef","title":"ben elton review nottingham playhouse","story":"Nottingham PlayhouseFifteen years since he last performed standup, Elton’s new show humbly embraces the madness of the modern world ‘It hasn’t been easy,” says Ben Elton, “trying to decide what to talk about.” You don’t say. His new standup show is stuffed to bursting with Elton’s takes on identity politics, post-truth, and every other cultural phenomenon since he last performed live comedy 15 years ago. It’s not a perfect return: there are missteps, lapses into fogeyism, and sometimes it’s more sermon that standup. But there’s big-hitting stuff here, too, and – as passionate as ever, 30 years on from his Thatcher-bashing heyday – Elton’s open and inquisitive engagement with the thorniest corners of modern living is bracing to experience.Having watched Messrs Carr, Gervais, Chappelle and others recently, I was ill-prepared for this level of humility from a middle-aged male standup faced with a fast-changing world. That’s the subject of Elton’s show: not only that “I don’t understand any more”, but that today’s world is so confusing, he now worries he never understood anything in the first place. What’s refreshing is that Elton – rather than fleeing towards old certainties – embraces the confusion, at least in principle.There’s a have-cake-and-eat-it dynamic at play, in that he repeatedly asserts his support of new developments in culture (particularly relating to gender and sexuality), while exploiting the humour of his predicament as a sexagenarian at sea in the modern world. He takes “pale, male and stale” on the chin, admitting this is “a limp, wrinkly Caucasian scrotum of a show”. His material on sexuality as a spectrum and trans awareness (“I used to know I was a man”) is disarmingly open-ended. So, too, a section on Germaine Greer’s journey from feminist hero to feminist pariah, the final line of which gets a laugh despite clearly not being meant as a joke.Does that mean Elton isn’t in control of his material? Occasionally, perhaps – a section on his father’s Alzheimer’s is awkwardly framed. But, more often, he treads deftly the delicate line between respect for a new generation’s truths and vestigial loyalty to his own. And he repeatedly finds the funny while doing so, with his striking line about all men sharing Harvey Weinstein’s bathrobe, a lurid future projection of his kids’ generation conga-ing to Kanye in their care homes, or his vision of what Tomorrow’s World might have looked like had Maggie Philbin really known what was in store for us.As he cartoon-stomps around the stage, the rhythms of 80s-era Elton are vividly summoned by, say, his early routine (“I’ve got the Alz”) about his fear of looming senility. Yes, conservatism creeps in, particularly after the interval, as he laments the advent of the internet, sourdough bread and craft beer. It’s usually self-aware and sometimes very droll, as when Elton protests at other people’s fingers “fossicking” (lovely word) in the rock salt. But the contention that everything was better “when I was a kid” gets a little over-insistent.There’s too much in the show – he’s no sooner started on Orwellian workplace terminology than he’s jumped those tracks to decry the Americanisation of the UK. Then – after he ardently debunks the myth that Boris Johnson is funny – the jokes fall away and Elton sounds a sonorous alarm at our looming “new dark age”. At its best, this is a show that’s intensely engaged with how we live now, from a comic who’ll grant you pale and male while humbly contesting the sell-by date."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d15e7605d06515d0bba590b3c101ba27fe5b572/606_505_3912_2347/master/3912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bba29311c226d35a1055b5aea7b91f26","title":"iphone 11 review iphone xr dual camera a13 smartphone","story":"Apple’s lower cost model has latest chips and longer battery life but is identical on outside to predecessorThe iPhone 11 is Apple’s latest lower cost smartphone for 2019 that’s clearly aimed at a broader market, offering most of what its top phones do but for £320 less.Costing from £729, the iPhone 11 is also £20 cheaper than last year’s iPhone XR was on launch – the phone it has now replaced.In fact the iPhone 11 is identical on the outside to the iPhone XR in almost all the ways that matter. It’s the same size and weight. It’s got the same glass and aluminium design, same 6.1in LCD screen with rounded corners, the same large notch at the top and same thick bezels around the sides.Flip it over and it’s got the same glass rear, except that “iPhone” is no longer written on the back and the Apple logo is positioned lower. The biggest difference is the new large, square camera lump in the top left corner, which on the iPhone 11 houses a new dual camera system.The phone is well built, feeling extremely solid and it has the best LCD screen you’re likely to see on a phone although it isn’t as good-looking, colour rich, bright or high contrast as the OLED screens fitted to the iPhone 11 Pro or Apple’s many rivals costing £500 and up.The iPhone 11 also suffers from the same disadvantages as the iPhone XR before it, namely it’s fairly heavy and wide with rounded edges that provide little in the way of grip. Compared to Samsung’s Galaxy S10, which has the same size 6.1in screen, the iPhone 11 is 5.3mm wider and 37g heavier and significantly harder to use one-handed.The iPhone 11 shares the same core as the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max: Apple’s latest A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage. It’s the fastest and most efficient of Apple’s chips yet, but the reality is that it’s very difficult to tell. The iPhone 11 doesn’t feel any faster than last year’s iPhone XRXS, or in fact the iPhone X in day-to-day usage.That’s not surprising as Apple focuses its chips on doing the things you’d normally do more efficiently, with power to do something unusual if you need it. That means the iPhone 11 should still be a top-performer in two, three, maybe four years from now. So really the only thing you need to know is that the iPhone 11 will handle everything you are likely to do, and then some.Apple also says that it’s managed to make the iPhone 11 last an hour longer than the iPhone XR, which lasted 32 hours between charges in my testing.I’m happy to report that’s a bit of an underestimate. The iPhone 11 lasts closer to 35 hours between charges, which makes it the longest-lasting iPhone to have crossed my test bench, getting me from 7am though until 6pm the following day.That was after the iOS 13.1.1 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.The iPhone 11 came out of the box with iOS 13 but was quickly updated to iOS 13.1 and then iOS 13.1.1, which was a good thing, as prior to the updates it was filled with bugs giving me all kinds of issues on three different iPhone 11 series phones.First off, the camera confirmation for restoring it from another iPhone didn’t work. Then I was immediately stuck in a password-demand loop for an email account, which ended up with me having to hit the cancel button and then quickly enter one character of my 35-character password before the password demand popped back up blocking me from entering more. Hit cancel, rinse and repeat. Absolutely infuriating.I had issues with location permissions getting stuck on “ask every time” for some apps. I also had several hard lockups of the phone prompting the three-button combo force restart procedure (up, down, hold power for ages), text in widgets and other areas was compressed and overlapping each other, and sometimes the camera failed to activate when launched.Most of the problems have been solved since the update to iOS 13.1.1, and it even added an extra hour to my battery tests.The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which turns the interface from a predominately black text on white background to white text on a dark background, either manually or on a schedule.You can now also long-press on control centre buttons such as Bluetooth or wifi, first to open a up more detail, then a second time to open up a quick connect menu as well as a button to take you straight to the appropriate place in the settings app for more extensive changes. It is a user-friendly feature that Android has had for years, so it’s good to finally see Apple catch up.A few new privacy options are welcome, including the ability to silence unknown and spam callers and finer-grain location permissions. Menstrual cycle tracking is now integrated into the Health app alongside headphone audio level, and there’s a new summary view, which makes the app more friendly and useful at a glance.It’s worth pointing out that Apple still provides the industry’s longest software support lifecycle of about five years from release where the best rivals cap out at about three years. It means you can safely use the phone for longer as you will continue to get important security updates as well as new features via iOS version updates.The iPhone 11 has a new dual 12-megapixel camera on the back. Oddly you get an ultra-wide camera alongside a standard camera, not the more typical 2x optical zoom camera. That means you’ve effectively got 0.5x and 1x optical zoom then up to 5x digital zoom, which is good, but doesn’t hold a flame to real optical zoom.Apple has significantly upped its game in the camera department this year, particularly in poor lighting conditions. Photos in good lighting conditions are some of the best on a smartphone, producing detail-rich and colour-accurate photos. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with.Other than your typical ultra-wide vistas, you can also use the new camera to photograph more of a building or object you can’t get far enough away from to use the main camera.Portrait mode is good too, and unlike on the XR can be used on more than just people. Apple’s smart HDR mode is also improved, producing images that are closer to class-leading Google Pixel cameras. But the biggest boost is Apple’s new night mode, which finally brings the iPhone’s very low-light performance up to scratch with the very best.It’s not as fast as Huawei’s P30 Pro, which doesn’t need a special night mode to shoot similar photos, nor quite as dramatic as Google’s Pixel 3, but produces images that are often lighter and better controlled.The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you are shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots – something I couldn’t test in dank, rainy Britain.The iPhone still struggles a little with indoor lighting where it’s not quite dark enough to benefit from night mode so produces images that are a little dark and lacking in detail. The selfie camera in particular produces somewhat grainy images here, but shoots great photos in better lighting conditions.Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, and easy to use, arguably better than rivals. The front-facing camera can also offers slow-motion selfies, which kids will love.Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 is a big step up, equalling or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features, although the lack of an optical zoom is disappointing.The iPhone 11 is an excellent but boring smartphone. It’s got a three-year-old design, which Apple broke the mould with in 2017 when it launched the iPhone X but now looks dated against the competition, particularly with the thicker bezels on the LCD screen. Things have moved on in the era of the all-screen smartphone.It’s fairly large, heavy and difficult to grip and use with one hand, but is also extremely well made and feels solid. These are all attributes shared by its predecessor the iPhone XR, as the iPhone 11 is essentially new guts in last year’s design.At £729 the iPhone 11 isn’t exactly cheap, costing the same as the top-of-the-line phones from competitors. But what you get for your £729 is Apple’s latest top-of-the-range processor with performance to match. Battery life that will easily see you into a second day, maybe a third if you’re careful. Camera performance that is up there with the very best, but lacking an optical zoom, replaced instead by a fun ultra-wide angle camera.You also get five years of software updates, which can’t be sniffed at. With a battery swap at some point there’s no reason an iPhone 11 won’t last you five years if you’re careful with it. In some tests the glass appears fairly tough to break, but less so in others, so whether it will survive real-world drops remains to be seen.If your primary driver is to buy the best, cheapest iPhone you can get, that’s the iPhone XR in 2019. If you want the best iPhone you can get, that’s one of the new iPhone 11 Pro line. So where does that leave the iPhone 11?Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, dated design, expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

People who are already psychologically vulnerable may be particularly at risk in such circumstances, he suggests.The British man in the report was brought to hospital by paramedics in an acute psychotic state, three weeks after the referendum result on the UK’s departure from the EU in June 2016. He was confused and very agitated, with disordered thoughts and speech. He heard voices and was delusional. He was also paranoid, believing people were spying on him and planning to kill him and that radio and television discussions were targeted at him.His wife explained that since the referendum result he had found it increasingly difficult to come to terms with the nature of political events around him. He became increasingly worried about racially motivated incidents and found it difficult to sleep, she said.From a multicultural background, the man described feeling ashamed to be British and said he lived in a constituency “that reflects an opinion that is not for me”.Recovery after three weeksDespite being prescribed drugs to alleviate his agitation and insomnia, his mental health continued to worsen to the point that he needed urgent hospital treatment.He was admitted to a psychiatric unit, given a tranquillizer to calm him down and prescribed an antipsychotic for about three weeks.He made a full recovery, was discharged home after two weeks and has had no further episodes.There was no history of mental ill-health in his family. But in the run-up to the referendum, he had experienced work and family pressures, both of which may have contributed to the deterioration in his mental health, notes the author, a psychiatrist in Nottingham.While this was just one case with particular circumstances, political events can be a source of significant psychological stress, according to the doctor. Separate studies have indicated the 2016 US presidential election, and Britain’s Brexit referendum, were significant sources of stress in their respective populations.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The uncertainty around the manner and timing of the UK’s departure from the EU and the possibility of a disorderly exit resulted in Revenue accelerating its recruitment plan."},{"url":null,"title":"coveney says reported uk brexit proposals don t look like the basis of an agreement","story":"The Government on Tuesday dismissed reported new proposals from the British government aimed at ending the impasse between London and the EU on the backstop.UK prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to present his final offer to the EU on Brexit to party colleagues at the conclusion of the Conservative party conference on Wednesday.According to a report in the Daily , Mr Johnson’s proposal would involve the introduction of two borders.One, a regulatory border in the Irish Sea between Britain and Northern Ireland, would be active for four years, while a second border for customs checks would be set up between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Speaking on Tuesday night, Tanáiste Simon Coveney said what was reported as the plan was “no basis for an agreement”, calling it “concerning to say the least”.“I haven’t seen the proposals yet,” he said. “I read that Prime Minister Johnson is going to bring forward a proposal tomorrow. Some are even saying he has briefing certain EU capitals in relation to these ideas since Tuesday. We haven’t seen anything.“We’ll have to wait and see. Obviously we’ll study any proposal carefully, but if the reports are true it doesn’t look like the basis of an agreement, that’s for sure.“Our position has been consistent, respectful and clear. If there is to be an alternative to the backstop it has got to do the same job as the backstop, which means no physical border infrastructure on the island of Ireland, and no related checks or controls.“The idea that you would be putting a customs border effectively between Northern Ireland and the Republic is not something that is consistent with that, or even close.”Mr Coveney echoed earlier comments by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that proposals involving customs checks in Ireland would be “bad faith” on the part of the British government.“If there is a proposal that involves customs checks on the island of Ireland, that in itself is bad faith given the commitments the British government has given both to Ireland and the EU over the last three years,” he told the Tonight Show on TV3.Addressing the growing threat of a no-deal Brexit with the UK due to depart the bloc on October 31st, Mr Coveney said Ireland faces “difficult choices” in relation to how to protest the EU single market as well as trade and peace on the island.“If we are forced into a no-deal scenario then we do have to agree with the European Commission how we protect Ireland’s place in the single market by protecting its integrity,” he said.“Otherwise Ireland gets dragged out of the single market by default when Britain leaves the EU and I don’t think we can allow that.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

As a result of the widespread dissemination of the non-details, next week’s Brexit Budget 2021 will be dismissed as a non-event.It’ll still be huge.In these mad days, non means nothing in the fullest sense of everything.It’s the elevation of nonsense, thanks to Boris Johnson and his tactical Brexit non-strategies. All supposedly dreamed up by Dominic Cummings, the brains of the outfit who apparently models himself on great military strategists like Bismark and the ancient Chinese General Sun Tzu.Or is it the guiding influence of great nonsense poets like Edward Lear and Spike Milligan? It’s hard to tell.After the weekend, the Dáil reluctantly examined the latest gobbets of nothingness hacked up by the British prime minister to avoid saying anything meaningful about his withdrawal intentions, probably because they have proved problematic for him throughout his philandering adult life.In recent days he tried to sidestep questions about “non-papers” which his people opened to the EU task force in strict secrecy only for the contents to mysteriously leak. Among other suggestions, the non-papers floated the wholly unacceptable idea of customs posts miles away from the Border on both sides with a weird class of no-man’s land in between.By Tuesday, Johnson was dismissing the idea when he had to address them in interviews.That afternoon during Leaders’ Questions, the Taoiseach welcomed the fact that the PM had “disowned himself” that morning on the radio. An unexpected display of leadership and courage, if it were true.Somebody had to do it.But as he was speaking, Leo Varadkar quickly shifted from “disowned” to “distanced”. The PM had distanced himself from the proposal.Or had he? You can never be sure with Johnson and what he might say at any given time. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin intimated this when telling Varadkar he needed to be very careful in welcoming everything Johnson said that morning because while he may have been dismissing the non-papers he has already said a lot of things about Ireland and the UK Border in Northern Ireland which are hardly a cause for optimism.As nonsense is the new normal, the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition held a discussion about the non-papers and who said what about them and where did they come from and what was in them.Martin wanted to know everything about the non-paper, since disowned by the British PM as a non non-paper. This was around about the time that Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney was ruling it out as a non-runner.There was a touch of the old wartime sitcom about the Dáil exchanges. We imagined Leo prefacing his opening reply to Micheál on the non-paper papers in a hammy “Allo Allo” voice while warning Micheál to “Listen carefully, I will say this only once”.Followed by a conspiratorial, “I am conscious, in answering your question, that I am talking about non-papers that I haven’t seen and I don’t mean that as a double negative, I actually haven’t seen them but I was aware of their existence indeed”.The possibility of a no-deal Brexit is very worrying. But wasn’t the only “bizarre” or “mad” situation considered in the chamber.Mattie McGrath wanted to talk about the victimising of “small greyhound owners” by Tourism Ireland and its decision not to promote greyhound racing to tourists.He began by telling the house that he finds the whole episode confusing. We found it confusing too. Was he talking about the owners of small greyhounds or greyhound owners who are small?What about the big greyhounds? Or the big owners?But Mattie, whose concerns on behalf of people in the greyhound world were shared by fellow rural independent Michael Healy-Rae and Fianna Fáil TDs John Brassil and Kevin O’Keeffe, meant all people involved in the industry.“I think this is bizarre,” he told the Taoiseach. “This is a mad decision.”Needless to say, when the Rural Independents are up in arms, Shane Ross is usually somewhere in the picture. This time, the Minister for Sport is squarely in the frame for this latest assault on rural life.How could his “interference” in the affairs of Fáilte Ireland be tolerated? Ross aka Winston Churchtown apparently had a quiet word with the organisation about promoting the greyhound industry and this was the result.“This is blackguarding rural Ireland again,” roared Mattie, calling on the Taoiseach to reverse the decision.It was like those heady days back in 2010 when the Independent TD for Tipperary was still a member of Fianna Fáil but lost the whip when he refused to vote for a Bill banning stag hunting by dogs. He left the party a few months later, a judicious move because most Fianna Fáil TDs were annihilated in the general election.The main pressure group agitating against that controversial Wildlife Bill was called Rise (Rural Ireland Says Enough).The Dáil’s representative for Rise wasn’t in the chamber for the angry response to Tourism Ireland’s decision not to promote greyhound related activities. But then, Paul Murphy only launched his Rise group on Monday having cut ties with the Socialist Party.In keeping with the fashion of the day, Paul’s departure was a non-split split.The Taoiseach said neither he nor anyone in the house would condone cruelty towards or mistreatment of animals, which is what promoted the Minister to approach Fáilte Ireland following recent revelations about practices in the greyhound industry.However, he revealed that he likes nothing better than a good night out at the dogs.“For my own part I got to Shelbourne Park every Christmas and have a very enjoyable evening. I intend to go again this year.”“Take Minister Ross with you,” bellowed Mattie. “If you can find him.”As far as Leo knows, Winston Churchtown asked Fáilte Ireland to consider the matter but the organisation “made the decision for itself”.Just a routine case of non-influence by an influential Minister when non means nothing in the fullest sense of everything."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4036850.1569960899!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach to join call for communicorp to reverse ban on journalists","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party TD Eamon Ryan: banning journalists from radio stations “has a very poor effect on our democracy”. Photograph: Tom Honan The Taoiseach will join other Dáil parties to write a letter calling on Communicorp to reverse a ban on journalists from The Currency website and The  from appearing on its radio stations.Leo Varadkar told Green Party leader Eamon Ryan that he did not agree with journalists being prohibited from radio or TV stations.In the Dáil on Tuesday, Mr Ryan raised the issue of a ban on some journalists taking part in programmes on Denis O’Brien-owned Communicorp radio stations.The Taoiseach said “I believe in free speech and I believe in a free press and I don’t believe anyone should be banned from the airwaves, journalist or citizen unless it’s for a very good reason. And those reasons should be somebody inciting hatred.”He added: “But I don’t think that anyone should be banned from the radio, from TV or from any publication solely based on who their employer is.”‘Free press’Mr Ryan said the ban was similar to a decision taken two years ago by Communicorp in response to an article by columnist Fintan O’Toole which resulted in  journalists also being banned.The Green Party leader said that banning journalists from radio stations “has a very poor effect on our democracy. We need a free press which is open to debate and allows different voices to be heard.”He added that “whether it’s for commercial reasons or whether it’s an editorial view of a certain owner that they mightn’t like what is written in a paper, to ban journalists from radio stations is not what we want”.Mr Ryan said that other party leaders and groupings in Leinster House were of the same view and he asked the Taoiseach to join them in writing to Communicorp asking them to reverse their decision.Mr Varadkar said “I’d be happy to join the deputy in that.”Business news website, The Currency, began publishing last week. It was founded by journalists Tom Lyons and Ian Kehoe. Among the stations owned by Communicorp are Newstalk,Today FM and Spin.

We need to ensure that Brexit and other political challenges don’t threaten the peace process by reintroducing a hard border.”The representative from Long Island added: “As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over any trade agreements between the United States and United Kingdom, I will fight to make a soft border and implementation of the Good Friday Agreement requirements for any negotiation.”Noting that the agreement was a “groundbreaking success” that proved critical to decades of relative peace, the resolution states that Britain’s exit from the European Union “threatens to undermine progress that has been made in moving beyond the legacy of the past in Northern Ireland. ”Latest interventionThe resolution notes that important issues remain unresolved in Northern Ireland, including securing justice for victims of state-sponsored violence and other violence and providing for the rights of all sections of the community.The Resolution was referred to the House foreign affairs as well as the Ways and Means committee.The introduction of the legislation is the latest intervention by Irish-Americans in Congress in the Brexit process, amid continuing concern about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland.A delegation representing civic and business leaders in Northern Ireland together with the ad-hoc committee established to protect the Good Friday agreement met with senior congressional figures last month amid continuing concern about the direction of Brexit on Northern Ireland.Sinn Féin’s Conor Murphy also met with senior politicians in the US Capitol during a visit to Washington last month.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Mr Stephens said that the card company, who he refused to name, allegedly initiated the legal proceedings about 12 months ago.Although people will be able to visit the store for the next two weeks, its doors will never open and the lights will remain on 24 hours a day. Items on display in the shop, which are only available to buy online, range in price from a £10 signed spray paint can to a handbag made from a house brick.“The proceeds from these products will go towards buying a new migrant rescue boat to replace the one confiscated by Italian authorities,” Banksy said.“So you may well be committing a criminal offence by purchasing them. Sometimes you go to work and it’s hard to know what to paint, but for the past few months I’ve been making stuff for the sole purpose of fulfilling trademark categories under EU law. It’s not a very sexy muse.”Other items for sale include disco balls made from used police riot helmets and a toddler’s counting toy where children are encouraged to load wooden migrant figures inside a haulage truck.Banksy said that despite trying to defend his artistic rights in this particular case, he has not changed his position on copyright.“I still encourage anyone to copy, borrow, steal and amend my art for amusement, academic research or activism. I just don’t want them to get sole custody of my name,” he said.Amongst the crowds gathered outside the shop on Tuesday was Janet Jones, 62, who lives locally.“It’s pretty incredible. The shop has been empty for a long while,” she said. “I’m pretty sure it was empty yesterday, It’s just happened so quickly.”Four security guards, dressed in brown trench coats, were stood outside the store. They told the Press Association\u0026nbspthat they did not know who they were working for or how long the job would last.Oliver Lewis, Croydon council’s cabinet member for culture, leisure and sport, said: “It’s really exciting, there’s a lot of people out here generating a lot of interest.“It just popped up overnight. That’s one of the great things about street art, it’s something for everyone to enjoy.”As previously reported by\u0026nbspThe Independent, the Banksy installation was spotted on Tuesday in south London. Located\u0026nbspin a formally derelict site beneath a PureGym in Croydon, and displays a number of different “rooms” including one showing a baby’s crib with CCTV cameras pointing at it.\u0026nbspThe “Stormzy vest” is accompanied by an explainer that reads: “A version of the ‘John Bull’ English gents waistcoat updated for modern times. This customised body armour is capable of stopping bullets up to .45 calibre and is fully stab proof.\u0026nbspEast Croydon-based music therapist Fraser Moyle, 29, was on his way to work when he spotted the installation, and said a friend who works nearby told him that work appeared to begin on Saturday 28 September. The downstairs part of the building had reportedly been derelict for months.\u0026nbsp“I immediately thought it could be a Banksy work due to the nature of the style, layout and political statements made in each window,” Mr Moyle told The Independent. “I spent the next half an hour staring in awe at the display! It’s amazing to have this artwork on show so close to home, and as a musician I think having Stormzy’s vest from Glastonbury in Croydon is special.”Additional reporting by agenciesThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We worked closely with the Deaf community to develop a feature that would improve access to digital media.Speaking on stage at Google IO, CEO Sundar Pichai said: You can imagine all the use cases for the broader community too. For example, tha ability to watch any video if you\u0027re in a meeting or on the subway without disturbing the people around you.English will be the only language supported by Live Caption and it will not work with phone calls, voice calls or video calls.Google revealed in September that the Pixel 4 range of phones will be launched at an event in New York City on 15 October. Pre-orders will likely open on that day before the global release date before the end of the month.Numerous other leaks mean there will be little left for Google to reveal at launch.It is expected to come with a significantly improved camera, as well as gesture controls that allow users to navigate by waving their hands at their phones.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was diagnosed with acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder, a category of acute and transient psychotic disorder\u0026nbsp– the first case believed to have been triggered by Brexit.The illness is characterised by an acute onset of symptoms and complete recovery within three months.The man recovered within a fortnight after a brief admission and treatment with olanzapine, an anti-psychotic.

He had auditory hallucinations, and paranoid, referential, misidentification and bizarre delusions.”The patient described his experiences as “intense periods of accelerated thinking, of being distracted and consumed by my own thoughts, and of a series of theatrical episodes of which I am at the centre”.The patient has had no family history of mental health problems, history of alcohol or substance misuse, or physical health issues barring mildly impaired hearing in one ear.He has remained well up to June 2019, when doctors last had contact with him.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The audio, which was leaked to The Verge, gave new details about how he plans to take on TikTok.The video-sharing app has experienced rapid growth since launching in China in 2016, with TikTok\u0026nbspdeveloper ByteDance claiming to have around 500 million users around the world.This is still relatively small compared to the 2.7 billion people who are estimated to use Facebook and its suite of apps that include Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.But the app’s popularity among teens led one employee to ask Zuckerberg to outline Facebook’s “plan of attack” to prevent it from haemorrhaging users to its Chinese competitor.Created with Sketch.Facebook birthday: 15 defining moments for the social network Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called \u0027TheFacebook\u0027 from his dorm.

So yeah, it’s a very interesting phenomenon,” Zuckerberg said.“So we have a number of approaches that we’re going to take towards this, and we have a product called Lasso that’s a standalone app that we’re working on, trying to get product-market fit in countries like Mexico, is I think one of the first initial ones.”Facebook introduced its Lasso earlier this year in Mexico, as it is one of the few countries where TikTok is yet to establish a presence.Facebook buys mind-reading startup CTRL-Labs for $1bnZuckerberg said the aim is to test out the app in Mexico before rolling it out to a global audience.“I think we have time to learn and understand and get ahead of the trend. It is growing, but they’re spending a huge amount of money promoting it,” Zuckerberg said.“What we’ve found is that their retention is actually not that strong after they stop advertising. So the space is still fairly nascent, and there’s time for us to kind of figure out what we want to do here. But I think this is a real thing. It’s good.”Zuckerberg also addressed other challenges facing the company, including its controversial\u0026nbspLibra cryptocurrency.He explained why he refused to testify in some parts of the world to face questions from lawmakers and regulators about the new currency, saying: It just doesn\u0027t really make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it’s also very much about a giant blob of goo that consumes everything in its wake. A pre-fame Steve McQueen in his feature film debut is the preppie high-schooler facing off against the aggressive alien entity. Burt Bacharach sings the film’s theme song¬ – driving home The Blob’s kitsch, drive-in-movie charm.210 The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976 Nicholas Roeg)If the experience of being abducted by aliens was translated into a cinematic mood, it would result in something like The Man Who Fell to Earth. It dispenses with all logic and concept of linear time, and instead takes place in a kind of unmoored netherworld (Nicholas Roeg fans will recognise and appreciate it immediately). And its power is punctuated, of course, by the presence of David Bowie, who is beautiful and uncanny, and perfectly cast.310 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 Philip Kaufman)We’re long-overdue a new remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The pod-people premise is effortlessly translated into new decades, and spun into powerful new metaphors for modern threats. But of the many incarnations of Jack Finney’s novel, it’s Philip Kaufman’s 1978 adaptation that remains its most terrifying and daring, exploiting the Cold War paranoia of the era and building to a devastatingly brutal final twist. Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy and a young Jeff Goldblum are among the stars confronted with an alien invasion that replaces the world’s populace with mindless doppelgängers.The original and still the best. And not just in terms of the long-running Alien franchise, but the alien genre as a whole. Chilly and sparse, with moments of languid contemplation interrupted by bloody carnage, Alien is both a haunted house movie and delicate meditation on life, power and authority. HR Giger’s ubiquitous design work remains terrifying, and Sigourney Weaver is an instant star as the compassionate and smart Ellen Ripley.A film that taught a generation of children (and, if we’re being honest, their parents) the importance of friendship, whether shared with an intergalactic gremlin or not. ET is magical cinema and the finest distillation of Steven Spielberg’s power as a filmmaker – emotional but never cloying, otherworldly but always resolutely human, and with a deep understanding and respect for child-like wonder. Anyone who isn’t in a puddle of tears by its conclusion is, I think according to international law, an irredeemable monster.Liquid Sky is a fluorescent revenge tale, a hyper-stylised fever dream, and the most vivid depiction of New York’s underground no-wave scene in the early 1980s. It sees aliens arriving in New York in search of heroin, only to discover better highs via the human orgasm. Meanwhile an aspiring, put-upon model learns that alien powers can be a tool to rid the world of bad people. Liquid Sky touches on sex, drugs, art and androgyny, with eye-candy set design and a transfixing lead performance from Anne Carlisle.Starman is ET if ET was an incredibly handsome 30-something man who looks uncannily like your dead ex. A radical departure for John Carpenter, this 1984 romantic drama sees Karen Allen’s grief-stricken widow spooked and then saved by the arrival of an alien who takes the form of her dead husband. An Oscar-nominated Jeff Bridges stars as the Starman of the title he is astounding, tasked with embodying something odd and otherworldly yet warm enough to be loveable. The film’s climax, in all its aching, deeply romantic glory, is a tribute to maintaining hope in the face of grief, and proof that Carpenter is no one-genre pony.Worth revisiting in the wake of the Amy Adams vehicle Arrival, Contact finds Jodie Foster communicating with aliens and fighting for the right to meet them. It is a still, thoughtful movie, interested in bureaucracy and misogyny in a way that sci-fi movies so often aren’t. But it also recognises the emotional power of marvelling at something extraordinary, and the sheer wonder of cracking open a door to the previously unimaginable. Robert Zemeckis hasn’t done anything of a similar quality in the decades since.A genre-splicing teen thriller that could only have been birthed in an era of Scream and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Faculty sees a cluster of disparate high schoolers (Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett and Clea DuVall among them) become convinced that their teachers have been replaced by aliens (the likes of Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen and a scene-stealing Robert Patrick having been transformed into pod-people overnight). Sweet, pulpy and dripping in Gen-X cool, The Faculty is Body Snatchers by way of The Breakfast Club, with the cheery spookiness of an RL Stine book you loved when you were 13.1010 Under the Skin (2013 Jonathan Glazer)Alien movies are unusual in that they’re always driven by outsiders and extra-terrestrials, yet almost always anchored by us, the humans. Under the Skin, a characteristically trippy experiment from visionary filmmaker Jonathan Glazer (Birth, Sexy Beast), is us as seen through the eyes of a beguiling and curious alien played by Scarlett Johansson. She marvels at human idiosyncrasies and our faces, or else delights in our chocolate cake. And in a further twist, she finds that she likes us. Under the Skin is uncomfortable and horrifying yet also unusually tender, and proof that we haven’t yet run out of new ways to depict alien visitors.Under the SkinSo eager are we to plant metaphors onto alien movies that The Blob has been referred to as everything from an analogy for the Cold War to a grim warning against the perils of capitalism.

Not even when it was introduced with a paragraph describing the story as non-literary.“Readers basically ignored that intro and engaged actively with the text itself anyway.”The paper, titled The Literary Genre Effect, will be published later this year in the journal Scientific Study of Literature.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Are they saying you are only ever three steps away from danger?“Everyone was watching, and knew we were the reason the ride was delayed.“Anyone that knows Sebby has been bored to death by his knowledge and love of Ninjago.”Ms Brett said after they finished on the ride, her son asked her: “Why would they make a disabled person walk? It really hurt.”She added: “If they’d have asked him to do it a month ago he wouldn’t have been able to and it would have ruined the whole day.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They also need to reconsider how inclusive their park is.”She added staff needed better training on how to deal with disabled children.A spokesman for the park apologised for any distress caused to the family, but said the policy was “necessary”.They said: “The health and safety of our guests is always our priority and we have a number of requirements in place to allow our guests with disabilities and additional needs to enjoy our rides.“On some rides, such as Lego Ninjago The Ride, guests are required to walk unaided. This is necessary in the case of guests being evacuated from the ride, as they would be required to walk during the evacuation process.“We are always working to make the resort more accessible and constantly review our processes.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

One much-trumpeted injection of funds was only enough for , a year, a fraction of the increase needed.We said only a bonfire of planning restrictions would do.And Mr Javid is promising just that, for new builds and extensions.He must also face down NIMBY neighbours and stop developers hoarding plots or releasing homes at a snail’s pace to keep prices high.We look forward to the detail . . . and hope it is not over-hyped, as so much was under Theresa May.Real change could bring homes in London and the South East within millennial buyers’ reach for the first time.Go for it, The Saj.GIVING Jeremy Corbyn power even for one ­second would harm Britain for a generation — and here’s why:To job-creating firms and foreign investors, we are a safe haven.Corbyn believes in none of that. His policies should terry anyone with a job, a business, pension, savings, a home or even a car. Labour would hammer businesses and seize private property.Remainer MPs seem tempted to install him in No “temporarily”. Remember how Labour only put the hard-left dinosaur on their leadership ballot in  to “widen the debate”  That went well.Does anyone seriously believe Marxists who have lusted after revolution for decades would surrender power once gted it  And what message will we have sent to the world eventhey did That our formerly serious country is only ever one act of madness away from installing a Marxist government with the same policies that reduced once-rich Venezuela to Third World ruin.The SNP couldn’t care less.

They will merrily help Corbyn for another independence vote.All other sane MPs must halt this lunacy.“BETRAYAL” is a word with no place in our politics, preaches holier-than-thou John Major, who used exactly that word as PM.MPs must soften their language, insists Major, who branded three Eurosceptic Tory ministers “bastards”.“Political chicanery” must not be used to take us out of the EU with No Deal, rules Major — who once swerved a scandal using his own chicanery and now backs any and all tricks to stop Brexit.Once PM.

Beyonce has been involved in a trade-mark dispute for years against Wendy Morales, whose wedding planning business goes by the same name.Beyonce is outraged at the idea that Blue Ivy Carter, “the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world”, might be confused with a boutique wedding event planning business.Which is unlikely, when you really think about it.So you might wonder why — really — Beyonce gives a flying fig about the fact that it has the same name as her daughter.But I guess — unless you are the mother of a cultural icon — it’s hard for mere mortals like us to understand.Beyonce has accused Morales of riding her coattails. Who knows, maybe she is. But so what What seems more relevant is the degree to which these parents apparently view their daughter as an extension of themselves.They care more about their fame and reputation than they do about letting Blue Ivy forge her own path, find her own identity and be herself.Yes, we all pass on our values and, to a degree, our aspirations to our children.But we all owe it to our kids to be aware of where we stop and they begin.And it seems to me that Beyonce and Jay Z are robbing their daughter of her childhood and suffocating her with their own aspirations.We only have to take one look around at those who haven’t been allowed proper childhoods — Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, Aaron Carter — to see how badly things can go wrong.Forget designer clothes and cultural icon status, the best thing Blue Ivy’s parents could give her is a proper childhood.We all think our kids are special. Most of us do our best NOT to spoil our kids and keep them grounded, they seem to want the opposite.They need to teach her that money and status is not as important as family, values, morals, kindness — and friends. THIS week I am mainly feeling fed up with politicians.I voted Remain because the chaos of leaving far outweighed any problems of staying in.But the country voted Leave and I accepted that. What’s the point in asking the country to votethe result is ignored Three years on and we are still waiting to leave. Boris Johnson is at least trying to honour the people’s decision.Jo Swinson for the Lib Debs, who is held up as a shining new light in politics, has said thather party wins an election – most unlikely – she will cancel Brexit on the basis that on the first vote the margin for Leave was so small and people didn’t know what they were voting for.But those are just excuses. She, and others, think they know best and would no doubt keep having the vote until they get the result they want – to remain in Europe.Politicians are trying to force a Remain outcome, through delays to Brexit, not calling a general election and following their own views on the EU rather than that of the country.But crashing out without a deal is not what really worries me. It’s the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government.Here is a man who sympathises with Russia – although they came here and killed people, including poisoning a police officer.A man who sympathises with the IRA, met with Hamas and Hezbollah and refused to sing the National Anthem.A man who wants to close private schools and implement a four-day week .This is a man who wants to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for private tenants and force landlords to sell their buy-to-rent properties for less than they are worth, leaving them in debt – then also clobber them with higher taxes.He wants to nationalise industry and confiscate £billion of shares in , large companies and hand them to workers.As Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.I hope politicians knock their heads together, compromise, get out of Europe and focus on the future outside of the EU – new trade deals, new investments, jobs and innovation.This is a great country, let’s hope it remains so.I KNOW Phoebe Waller- Bridge is not for everyone – although her telly show Fleabag is pretty damned funny.But whether you like her or not, she is currently on a serious roll.TV awards left, right and centre including Emmys and Baftas – and now she has just signed a £million deal with Amazon.Her talent is incredible.IN her new memoirs, Demi Moore has criticised ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for “shaming” her by sharing a picture of her in her underwear during their marriage.Apparently, he justied it at the time by saying that sharing a snap of Demi half-naked was just a “good-natured joke”.Really ACTOR Christopher Eccleston has revealed his lelong battle with anorexia – which some, who think of it as a woman’s affliction, may have found shocking.Meanwhile, F’s Lewis Hamilton has revealed he’s not happy with his body and has clearly spent his letime trying to become so.Both stories are reminders that men are becoming as fixated with their physiques as women have been all these years.What we are left with is a reality that no one – man or woman – is ever -per-cent happy with their looks.I most certainly am not.THIS Wednesday sees theof The Apprentice at pm on BBC .The show starts with a bang when Lord Sugar sends candidates off to South Africa to run a safari tour.When they don’t know the dference between an elephant and a rhino, you know it spells disaster . . .  but in a good way.This series is the best ever, so I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as we did making it.Freddy McConnell, , from Kent, wants to be registered as “father” or “parent”, despite having physically given birth to the baby – but a judge ruled against him.This is tricky, but the judge’s decision has to be the right one.

They could end up re-shaping the political landscape of this country forever.The Supreme Court’s outlawing of a political decision and the coward Corbyn’s refusal to trigger a general election have created a dangerous Commons stalemate.At the same time voters are powerless as political conventions which are the backbone of our democracy are reshaped before their eyes.Tuesday’s court judgement overruling Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament will have a chilling effect on decision-making at the heart of government.How many future kne-edge rulings made by a PM against the clock could now be quashed by the court What about the signing of treaties  Or the appointment of ministers How about choosing to take military action in retaliation for an attack on Britain You can bet Vladimir Putin is lapping up the prospect of a British Prime Minister having to go cap in hand to a  of judges to askhe can hit back.The Supreme Court has potentially paved the way to a new era of rule by a group of unelected entities. Meanwhile, the Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition has shown once again that he has the spine of a jellyfish.Jeremy Corbyn’s actions are those of a man who is scared to face the voters, scared of his own Labour MPs and scared of even being PM.Together with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson he is intent on driving Britain away from the Brexit a majority voted for and into a rigged referendum which nobody deserves.They are also forcing us away from the general election which the country is crying out for and into another EU extension which will only prolong our agony.This week the SNP are leading a plot to ambush Boris with a vote of no confidence while he prepares to address the Tory conference.Perhaps they should consider how Scottish voters would feelthey had won an independence vote only to find it hadn’t been implemented three years later.Our shambling farce has gone on too long.But as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox says even these turkeys won’t be able to prevent Christmas.Britain’s voters will get their say eventually.At that moment they will decide one of two very clear futures for this country.Either a resumption of the democratic traditions and institutions at the heart of our society under Boris Johnson.Or a disunited kingdom, riven by the elite interests of lawyers and rival factions, carving up our political landscape between them.It would mean goodbye to the Britain we treasure as a beacon of democracy.And herald the dawn of a chaotic virtual republic under complete enslavement to Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Asked whether that would include the DF-, Cai said, “Please wait and see.”No details of the DF- have been released, but the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said it may have the world’s longest range at , kilometres.US nuclear tipped missiles fall a few thousand kilometres short of that.Analysts say the DF-, flying at  times the speed of sound, might be able to reach the US in  minutes with up to  warheads for separate targets.China’s current mainstay missile the Dongfeng- — Dongfeng means “east wind” — has a range of more than , kilometres that puts most of the continental US within reach.Todays carefully coordinated celebrations in China came as a protester was shot in the chest by police in Hong Kong, where violent demonstrations continued against the regime.Tensions remained high today as cops banned rallies in Hong Kong, in fear of chaos on Chinas National Day.Tens of thousands of black-clad protesters marched in multiple pro-democracy rallies, urging Chinas Communist Party topower to the people.In a bid to stop demonstrations, riot police repeatedly fired tear gas in several areas as protesters hurled gasoline bombs, bricks and other objects in their direction.Video footage showed a campaigner - a man struck by a live round - begging for help as he bled on the street.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One day’s coverage is no longer tomorrow’s chip-paper.”Harry, who is represented by high-powered London legal firm Harbottle  Lewis who have made several complaints to newspapers on his behalf, also claimed the couple had been unable to correct “continual misrepresentations” in the press.He also even questioned the positive newspaper coverage the couple have enjoyed during their current Southern African tour.The Duke and Duchess have been pictured every day since last week attending a series of events to highlight good causes close to their hearts.Each visit has been crafted by a team of public relations experts to help improve their image.That included Harry’s visit to land mine fields in Angola - just like Diana did in the s and a rare public appearance by their baby son Archie.But the Prince claimed this “positive” coverage of himself and Meghan on the tour exposed “the double standards” of the press.He added: “She is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you’ve seen on this Africa tour.“I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.”Meghan started the costly legal action against the Mail on Sunday newspaper over an allegation it “unlawfully” published a letter from her to her father Thomas Markle earlier this year.The Duchess insists the letter - which detailed her pain at their estrangement since the Wedding - was private.Law firm Schillings, representing the Duchess, said she had filed a High Court claim against the paper and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement ofand breach of the Data Protection Act .The legal proceedings in the Chancery Division of the High Court are being privately funded by Harry and Meghan.Depending on the court ruling, proceeds from any damages will be donated to an anti-bullying charity.In response to Harrys statement, Royal author and Prince Charles’ biographer Penny Junor said: “This is the most extraordinary statement and goes way beyond anything I have ever seen issued by a member of the royal family.“I completely understand that Harry should feel protective about his we and there have undoubtedly been some negative stories in the last nine months that must have hurt - but not exclusively in the Mail on Sunday - and they have not all been lies, nor I would suggest, part of a ruthless campaign.“The positive coverage of this last week in Africa is richly deserved. This feels to me like an over-emotional and somewhat ill- advised outburst.”A Mail on Sunday spokesman said: The Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.Specically, we categorically deny that the Duchess’s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Around  years ago, as co-presenter of BBC’s live TV show Crimewatch Daily, I interviewed a man called Mick North.Mr North was a lecturer in biochemistry at Stirling University in Scotland and, shortly after giving birth to their daughter Sophie, his we Barbara was diagnosed with breast cancer and died just two and a half years later – leaving him with a toddler to bring up alone.On March , , he dropped Sophie – by then aged five – at school and headed off to work.The school was Dunblane Primary and she was shot dead by social misfit Thomas Hamilton who, armed with the four guns and  cartridges he owned legally, massacred  pupils and one teacher.In , after writing a book about the tragedy, Mr North came on the show to tell his heart-breaking story and to explain why, in , he had joined the Gun Control Network to campaign for tighter vetting.Sympathising with a man who had lost his daughter in such unconscionable circumstances, I simply said something along the lines of, “I’m not surprised” – a comment seized upon as “partisan” by the gun lobby, who then bombarded the BBC with complaints.The next day I was forced to apologise on air.Yes, it’s important that those presenting on the BBC are seen to be impartial when discussing politics but, be it Naga, citing her own experiences of racism or, in my case, sympathising with a man asking for tighter gun laws after his young daughter was shot dead, these are human reactions that should be judged using common sense, not boiler-plate rules.IN Debbie Harry’s compelling memoir, Face It, she writes about the time David Bowie was backstage with her and rock star Iggy Pop.She says: “David pulled out his c*ck – asI were the official c*ck checker or something.“He loved to pull it out, with both men and women.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though.

Forcing them to carry crack cocaine and heroin across rural and coastal communities.“Threatening them into carrying guns and knives as ‘protection’.

The rest admitted conspiracy to burgle.She was found guilty of money laundering after a trial but cleared of the burglary charge.Asian gold jewellery, designer clothes and watches were all swiped in the raids then taken back to Romania, where the crooks enjoyed the trappings of their criminal enterprise.Other property was stored at an address in Oldbury - described as an Aladdins cave of stolen goods.One victim whose home was attacked and Christmas presents stolen told the court: Since the break-in of our property our children have been devastated.Their home should have been their safe haven. I had jewellery given to me from grandparents which can never be replaced. They ransacked my bedroom and my childrens bedroom.I go round checking doors  times over. My husband had his wedding ring stolen. It is going to take a very long time to feel safe again.Another said: My bedroom and personal space was invaded. Even today I have flashbacks.I am still left out of pocket. The biggest impact has been emotional.Officers made a breakthrough on September , , when traffic cops monitoring an uninsured car on the M watched as a bag containing jewellery, stolen from a home in Solihull, was thrown from a window.Zaharia was arrested and his DNA taken which later matched to a blood stain found at a burglary.Police intelligence linked Zaharia to an address in Oldbury and on December  cops executed a warrant at the house where all five were detained.Bundles of cash and stolen jewellery was also recovered – as well as £, in Spiru’s handbag – alongside burglary “paraphernalia” including several pairs of rubber grip gloves and tools.Sgt Sandy Thompson said: “This group has been responsible for untold heartache, worry and inconvenience among hundreds of residents across the region. It’s one of the biggest burglary conspiracies we’ve ever seen in the West Midlands.We’ve linked them directly to  burglaries where £, and property valued at £, was taken – but we suspect they’ve committed far more offences and taken cash and valuables worth millions of pounds. Four or five hundred is a conservative estimate.They were ruthlessly organised: they would scope out homes in affluent areas, wait till nightfall and strike at addresses with the lights off that appeared unoccupied.“They always broke in via first floor windows to avoid alarm sensors on the ground floor, to get straight into bedrooms where valuables were likely to be kept and even took jewellery testing kits with them to test the purity of gold items at the scene.The group made regular money transfers to family members back home via Oldbury post office and other outlets.We also found lots of photos showing friends and family in Romania posing in expensive jewellery taken from homes in our communities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"woman leg gash young farmers ball","story":"The -year-old suffered the gaping wound to her leg at the dinner dance event at Tillington Hall Hotel, Stafford, on Friday, September .Cops have now launched a probe and are trawling CCTV in a bid to get to the bottom of mystery incident which left one member of Eccleshall YFC needing several stitches.The woman suffered a deep cm cut to the back of her right leg at around .pm - but it not yet known what happened.She was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital where the wound was stitched together but has since been released.Staffordshire Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs has now released a statement.A spokesman said: We are saddened that one of its YFC members was injured during Eccleshall Young Farmers’ Clubs’The YFC member involved has received hospital treatment and is now back home with her family.We are in contact with the YFC member and their family to support them during this dficult time.

Martyn Evans, , was found dead on a sofa hours just hours after drinking heavily with four friends. The two men and two women decided to have a bit of fun at his expense and filmed their treatment of Martyn, including trying to shave his eyebrows. They poured bleach and washing-up liquid on his head - and put a banana up his nostril.An inquest at Avon Coroneraposs Court heard Martyn was more intoxicated than the rest of the group, and was clearly out of it on the sofa as the antics went on.A coroner said: I find the behaviour of these four iniduals towards Martyn, a vulnerable man, to be appalling.    After attempting to wash some of the bleach out of Martynaposs hair, the group then carried him back to the sofa to sleep - and found him dead there just hours later. The four people involved - aged between  and  - pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court in August this year to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. They were each handed an -month community order, with rehabilitation, but their bullying actions were not linked to Martynaposs death. Coroner Dr Peter Harrowing recorded a short narrative conclusion at Martynaposs inquest - stating that he was unable to determine how the young man came by his death. The inquest heard that Martyn, who lived in Withywood, Bristol, had a long history of learning and developmental dficulties. On October , , the night before his death, he had gone with two friends to the home of another two of their friends in Highridge, Bristol, for an evening of drinking. According to one female member of the group, who claimed she was not drinking that night, Martyn and the other three drank around  cans between them, the inquest heard. When paramedics from South-West ambulance service were called to the address in Highridge shortly after .am the following morning, they found Martyn in a state of rigamortis on the sofa. Mr Harper said he spoke to Martynaposs friend who lived in the house, who seemed visibly distressed and very shaken. The man explained that Martyn had come round the night before with another friend and that Martyn had been drinking Stella Artois beer throughout the night. He told Mr Harper he was not sure how much Martyn had consumed, but he was drunk, and at am, the man had helped him to the sofa to sleep, the inquest heard. He said that he next saw Martyn when he walked into the sitting room at .am and found him dead. The inquest heard that PC Matthew Stanford and Sergeant Lisa Colton, of Avon and Somerset Police, then attended the scene. The two officers entered the sitting room and saw Martyn on his back on the sofa, covered with a white duvet, and with vomit stains on his upper jeans, the neckline of his t-shirt, and the soles of his socks.  They then concluded that Martynaposs death was a tragic accident, and that he could have choked on his own vomit after being left to sleep on his back whilst extremely drunk, the inquest heard.

The xs have been drafted in because organisers were unable to locally obtain cars suitable for the royal couple and their baby son Archie. It is understood that the cars for the trip were offered by Jaguar Land Rover, and were transported at no cost to the taxpayer. A palace source said it was due to security concerns to transport the royals. The manufacturer has provided vehicles for the royal family for decades, including on foreign visits.    Meghan was pictured today arriving in a British-registered blue Range Rover during her visit to the University of Johannesburg, South Africa. Aides and personal protection officers have been seen in four Land Rover Discovery vehicles, four green and one blue. Harry and Meghan faced criticism in August after reportedly taking four private jet journeys in  days, rather than opting for commercial flights, despite speaking out on environmental issues. The Duke has previously said that he would have a maximum of two children due to his concerns about climate change.    Speaking for a special edition of British Vogue in August, Harry said: “What we need to remind everybody is: These are things that are happening now. We are already living in it. “We are the frog in the water and it’s already been brought to the boil.

My mother couldnapost walk at the time, she had to be wheeled to the bathroom, the whole trolley, so that means everybody near her has to be moved, thereaposs trolleys in front of the toilet door, that person has to be moved. At one point my mother was under the glove dispenser, which meant people were leaning over her to get gloves, she couldnapost get any rest. We couldnapost wash her, I had a few times where I just broke down in tears.    People of all ages, everyone there in that zone, are sick, this isnapost people with broken bones, these are all people who need to be admitted to hospital. People were getting heart traces done in the corridor, people who had had heart attacks, strokes, dementia, everything has to be discussed out in the corridor, everyone knows each otheraposs medical records. Initially she didnapost have compos mentis due to the infection but became more aware the better she got, but her spirits dropped, itaposs so demoralising. When she became clearer on Friday, mam said to me: aposIf thereaposs a fire or a gas leak here, people are going to die, because there is no possible way they could evacuate that AEapos. There was people there with ious forms of dementia who donapost know that the blanket has slipped off, who are in ious states of undress, and she was watching this asking: aposAm I that way apos, and I was reassuring her, but itaposs so hard to see. You need someone with you who is physically fit enough to stand for hours on end, no relatives or visitors can have a seat to sit down as thereaposs no room, so you have to stand and just wait and wait.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

The main cause is the revised tarfs for out of area patients.#In addition, we have had a mental health long stay patient from out of our area which accounts for £, of the in-month movement which is unusual.#On the forecast year overspend, Ms Orr added: #The biggest single area of social work overspend is on learning disability, where there has been a failure to deliver anticipated savings so far, along with higher than budgeted demand.#This links closely with the year to date position. Again both are affected by the same factors. The next two largest areas of forecast overspend are physical disability and older people.#The biggest threat to the financial position of the IJB remains an ongoing dispute over service level agreement charges with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the overspend liable to rise should no deal be reached.Ms Orr added: #The IJB made a decision to reject the increase [in service level agreement charges] and the forecast outturn reflects this position.

Scottish Ministers dont have the power to extend the Borders Railway.And doubts have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main Line.\"Diesel hauled trains not in a hurry already go via Dumfries so having another ersionary alternative route would not add

Police Scotland does not make any financial contribution to the town centre schemes.ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.ldquoFor information, previous work undertaken by officers in  indicated that the likely total capital cost of replacement, on a like for like basis, while utilising more modern digital technologies, could be in the region of circa pound,.ldquoThere would be potentially additional costs associated with related civils works and infrastructure in the region of pound,.ldquoA follow up report could update and validate this figure to present-day costs, however given the anticipated capital expenditure of circa poundm, plus a requirement for future on-going enhanced revenue expenditure, officers do not believe that this will provide value for money.ldquoIn addition, there is currently no identied budget, either capital or revenue.However, at a full council meeting in May, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell put forward a motion calling on officers to explore options for keeping the CCTV network, and officers have suggested a public consultation be held.The motion was agreed, and so the council will consult with ious stakeholders in the CCTV network, including Police Scotland, community councils and area partnerships, as well as providers of CCTV network systems and infrastructure to determine potential costs.The consultation will then form the basis of a series of options for CCTV in the Borders which councillors will be asked to approve, most likely in December.The councilrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar, said: ldquoWe know that CCTV can be a useful tool for the police and communities in terms of public safety.ldquoHowever, we also know that in order for the cameras to contribute to creating safe environments in our towns, the technology needs to be kept up-to-date.ldquoWith a growing demand for our services, and budget constraints, the Council must consider whether replacing the current system is value for money, and what other options are available.ldquoIn order for the council to make a fully informed decision, we need the views of the public and would encourage residents, businesses and community groups to take part in our consultation before the October  deadline.The survey is available at scotborders.citizenspace"},{"url":null,"title":"dream-wedding-dashed-thomas-cook-goes-bust","story":"A PEEBLES couple have had their dream wedding in Turkey shattered by the collapse of Thomas Cook.Groom Kevin Weir and his bride Kirsteen Barrett forked out pound, to fly their  guests to celebrate their wedding in the sun.But with only two weeks to go until they jetted off to say their vows, news that the travel firm had gone bust wrecked their plans.The distraught couplersquos wedding is now in ruins and they fear it could take months before they see a penny of their money refunded.Bride-to-be Kirsteen told us she broke down after hearing news that the travel operator had gone into liquidation this week.ldquoI just couldnrsquot believe it.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day. During our visit there was nothing unusual moving over the sea but the warden accounted for an adult Pomarine Skua, a Manx Shearwater and four Red-breasted Merganser. Then at .am the next day another birder had a Sabinersquos Gull with Kittiwakes and an Artic Skua. Then on September  a Mediterranean Gull appeared over the wardenrsquos cottage and there was a fly-past by a Grey Plover.These sightings had obviously aroused interest and a two-hour sea watch first thing on September  saw three Arctic Skua flying north,  Red-throated Divers, nine north, five south and  Common Scoter flying north.Less common migrants began to appear towards the end of the week with Lesser White Throat, Yellow-browed Warbler, Wood Warbler, Pied Flycatcher, Barred Warbler, Yellow Wagtail, Redstart and Black Redstart.In the following week Barnacle Geese passed over. This illustrates that birdwatching at this time of year can be exciting.

To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.The couple are coming to the end of a -day tour of southern Africa with son Archie which has received favourable coverage, but the duke said these positive publications exposes the ldquodouble standards of this specic press pack.Meghan has launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday newspaper over an allegation it unlawfully published the letter to her father.Law firm Schillings, representing the duchess, said she had filed a High Court claim against the paper and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement ofand breach of the Data Protection Act .In the statement published on the duke and duchessrsquos official website, Harry said he and Meghan believed in ldquomedia freedom and objective, truthful reporting as a ldquocornerstone of democracy.Addressing readers, he added: ldquoUnfortunately, my we has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against iniduals with no thought to the consequences ndash a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.ldquoThere is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specically when it is knowingly  and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face ndash as so many of you can relate to ndash I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.It is understood the couple did not take legal action lightly, but the timing of the announcement will over overshadow the final day of their Africa tour on Wednesday.In February, the Mail on Sunday published extracts of Meghanrsquos handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle. In one extract, published by the newspaper, the duchess wrote: ldquoYour actions have broken my heart into a million pieces ndash not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this. Something I will never understand.In the run up to the wedding, Mr Markle was caught up in controversy after he allegedly staged paparazzi photographs of himself and then began commenting regularly to entertainment website TMZ about his contact with his daughter.Harry explained that the alleged unlawful publication of the private letter was done in ldquoan intentionally destructive manner to ldquomanipulate readers.He claimed readers were misled by ldquostrategically omitting select paragraphs, specic sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year.He added: ldquoThere comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives.ldquoPut simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isnrsquot acceptable, at any level.ldquoWe wonrsquot and canrsquot believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.A spokeswoman for law firm Schillings claimed the ldquointrusive publication of the letter was part of Associated Newspaperrsquos campaign to write ldquo and deliberately derogatory stories about Meghan, ldquoas well as her husband.A Mail on Sunday spokesman said: ldquoThe Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.ldquoSpecically, we categorically deny that the duchessrsquos letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Harry accuses tabloid press of  uruthless campaign u against Meghan"},{"url":null,"title":"first-reported-case-brexit-triggered-psychosis-presented-doctor","story":"A doctor has warned that political upheaval can take a serious toll on mental health as he revealed details about the first reported case of Brexit-triggered psychosis.The male patient, in his forties, suffered hallucinations and delusions when his mental health ldquodeteriorated rapidly shortly after the results of the EU referendum in summer .He also became increasingly worried about racial incidents and, after being admitted on to a psychiatric ward, said he felt ashamed to be British.Dr Mohammad Zia Ul Haq Katshu, who treated the patient, wrote: ldquoHis we reported that since the EU referendum results were declared on  June , he started spending more time putting his thoughts across on social media.ldquoHe found it dficult to reconcile with the political events happening around him.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head!

I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or

It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"POLITICS WATCH  Nothing like a dame to perk up this panto","story":"The Andrew Marr Show chose the latter strategy. It is dficult to see why. A time limit on the interview might have been part of the deal with Downing Street, but the beauty of a live programme is that things can changeneed be. Marrs interview with Boris Johnson was just reaching a critical juncture when the show segued to a pre-recorded interview with Dame Helen Mirren about Catherine the Great .Granted, viewers might have been looking forward to hearing from Dame Helen, but the segment could have been included in a longer version of the programme placed on iPlayer. Yes, the PMrsquos minders would likely have moanedthe interview overran, and it is not quite cricket to go back on an arrangement, yet as we are being constantly told, we are living in extraordinary times.As for the interview with Angela Rayner, Shadow Education Secretary, it could be justied by way of reaction to the Johnson interview. Couple of questions, job done. But we had her response, plus a rehash of last weekrsquos Labour conference story about public schools in England, and yet more speculation on what might happen next on Brexit.Was this a case of the BBC playing it safe when a commercial broadcaster might have gone for it with the Johnson interview and had the arguments later : PM says he acted with proprietyJust as these are unusual times, so Mr Johnson is an exceptional interviewee. That was made plain once more during his encounter with Marr. It was asthe BBC man was equipped with a water pistol, delivering questions in short, sharp, well-aimed bursts, and Mr Johnson was countering with one of those water cannons he bought as London Mayor and was banned from using by the then Home Secretary Theresa May. ldquoWhoosh! went a torrent of metaphor and hyperbole in Marrrsquos direction.It is a dficult style to combat. Interviewing Mr Johnson on the Today programme, Mishal Husain resorted to telling him to ldquoPlease stop talking, which he laughed at and carried on. Eddie Mair managed to get further than most by being icily forensic and not allowing himself to be distracted by the Johnson bluster. Marr did a heroic job of hauling the PM back to the topic on the many occasions he tried to break free, but even this was not enough to halt the tide of verbosity.The most newsworthy moment came towards the end of the encounter when talk turned to Mr Johnsonrsquos friendship with American businesswoman, Jenner Arcuri. The subject had been raised during the paper review. ldquoA lot of people are wonderingwe are going to talk about the Jenner Arcuri affair, said Marr during the item. ldquoYes, we are. They had to, given it was the splash in the Sunday Times. Plus, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had criticised the show for not tackling a Minister about the story last week, when it broke.: Facing court again over extensionThis time, Marr asked several times whether Mr Johnson, as London mayor, had declared any links to Ms Arcuri given her business was in receipt of public money and she had gone on publicly funded trade missions. ldquoThere was no interest to declare, said the PM.Over on Ridge on Sunday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, adopted a similar, nothing to see here, approach to the Arcuri story, saying that everything went through the proper processes.Next up was Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, whose party had taken out a double page ad in a Sunday newspaper proposing an electoral pact with the Conservatives as a way to give Mr Johnson ldquoa big, workable majority. The PM later brushed aside the offer.Host Sophy Ridge tackled Mr Farage on a recent speech in which he said ldquowersquoll take the kne to overpaid pen pushers in Whitehall who had tried to frustrate Brexit. ldquoIt would have been better to say axe, he conceded, claiming such language was are more in keeping with political tradition.If Mr Farage was now the vocabulary police to Mr Hancockrsquos traffic cop, it has hard to know what role Jackson Carlaw was playing on Sunday Politics Scotland. In the face of questioning by host Gordon Brewer, the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives was like the office temp who had unwisely picked up a ringing phone as he was passing. No, he had not been consulted by London over new EU proposals. Nor was he going to be drawn on whether the PM would have to resignhe did not obey the law and seek a Brexit extension, as one of his own MSPs, Adam Tomkins, insisted earlier this month. Nothing had anything to do with Mr Carlaw, but he would take a message and make sure the right person received it once they ed from lunch.: Hospital building programme highlightedAt least he did not add more intemperate words and heat to what had been a torrid week. On Marr, Helen Mirren said Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, once advised that it was best to praise in a loud voice and scold in a whisper. How wise. It was worth having the grand dame on after all."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-tories-back-spring-election-capitalise-snp-turmoil-following-salmond-trial","story":"The plea to the Prime Minister came as the partyrsquos annual conference in Manchester heard another major spending announcement: a plan to raise the national living wage to pound. an hour by  unveiled by Sajid Javid, the Chancellor, as he sought to move the conference spotlight away from allegations surrounding Mr Johnsons private le.The further sign that an election is on its way has prompted Scottish Tory MPs to urge the PM to rule out a December poll and wait until next year to go to the country, preferably in the spring.:Opposition parties reject SNPs bid for snap no-confidence vote as rt remainsSome party insiders argue that, apart from avoiding the effects of a bad winter in Scotland, holding an election in March  could bring electoral benefits for the Conservatives in their battle with Nicola Sturgeonrsquos SNP following the high-profile Salmond court case.One senior Scottish Tory source told The Herald: ldquoIrrespective of the outcome of the trial, the Nationalists will be in turmoil.In his set-piece speech, Mr Javid told conference that his \"ambitious\" proposal - which as well as a rise in the amount of the living wage would also see the age threshold lowered to cover all workers aged over  - would give four million people a pay rise.He explained he wanted the national living wage to be raised to match two-thirds of median earnings, which would represent a p hourly increase in .\"Over the next five years, we will make the UK one of the first major economies in the world to end low pay altogether,\" declared the Chancellor.But Mr Javid said the Government wanted to reward the hard work of millennials and bring down the age threshold to cover all workers over .But John McDonnell, his Labour Shadow, dismissed the announcement, saying: ldquoThis pathetic attempt at catch-up by the Conservatives will fool nobody.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI Director-General, said: ldquoBusiness shares the Chancellors ambition to end low pay.

She paused before adding ldquoRemember all those times I couldnrsquot come to Glasgow to see you girls  Well that was because I didnrsquot have the money to put petrol in the car.I could see a little of what my friend was so passionate about: I really admired the seemingly over-arching confidence of the girls I had been at school with. I craved that confidence for my children. We were a purposeful, articulate and loyal bunch. We stretched our wings in the sciences, creative writing and Latin.We were surprisingly erse too - from the children of the inherited rich to the daughters of the just-recently-got rich. From the off-spring of immigrants whorsquod arrived with a fiver in their pockets to the few girls who faced abuse walking through some of Glasgowrsquos poorer areas to get to the school, we were quite a motley crew.As a Muslim, I was proud to inform my parents that my best friends were a Jew and a Christian. We confidently asserted ourselves, and expressed our ideas freely, perhaps without fear of what any boys in the class might think of us. Most,not all, of us assumed we would go to university or college and then onto work.But I often wonderedour confidence was a bit like our school unorm, and indeed our accents - something we put on, to homogenise us, to make us a type, maybe to cover up or compensate for any wee shortcomings we might have had.We were also utterly terried of the kids from the local state school. They sat on a wall nonchalantly eating chips as we walked by, but we actually thought they wanted to kill us - a perfect example of how a lack of contact, breeds fear. It floors me to think that,  years later, a close friend and colleague, Kate, who I cannot even contemplate starting a work project without, was one of those chip-eating lsquoterrorsrsquo.I knew that sort of insularity and lack of, as I saw it, iniduality was not what I wanted for my own children.Ultimately, both had six years at state school, having encountered young people from a wide spectrum of backgrounds and abilities, accents and sensibilities.I watch them in their workplaces interact with customers with an ease I could have only dreamt of. They describe nights out that involve skillful de-escalations of potentially dficult situations with groups of other young men in the street.They are quietly confident but always attuned to the group dynamic. Most importantly I value their iniduality, and their determination to go against the flow or fashion. They may not have particular loyalties to their old school tie, but perhaps thats not a bad thing."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-offer-new-brexit-plan-brussels","story":"The UK will offer Brussels a revised Brexit deal by the end of the week as Prime Minister Boris Johnson ramps up efforts to strike an agreement.It is understood the legal text of a Brexit plan will be sent to Brussels after the Tory conference concludes on Wednesday.The move comes as Irish broadcaster RTE reported the UK had put forward the idea ofcustom clearance centres being set up five to ten miles either side of the Irish border.:Opposition leaders plot to stop Boris Johnsons no-deal Brexit planHowever, Government sources distanced themselves from parts of the reports.The reported plans by the British Government to create customs posts along both sides of the Irish border to replace the backstop were dismissed by Irish deputy premier Simon Coveney.The idea for the customs posts are contained in the so-called lsquonon-papersrsquo submitted by UK officials during recent technical discussions.Mr Coveney poured cold water on the plans, saying Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ldquodeserves better.:Scottish court bid to ensure Boris Johnson \"obeys law\" over Brexit to startHe tweeted: ldquoNon-Paper  Non-Starter.

Mendacious, philandering scumbag! were some of the more temperate reactions on social media to Boris Johnsons recent round of BBC interviews.But judging from the PMs relaxed and unruffled demeanour on Marr and the Today programme, hes not that bothered. His political advisers believe that most people are, rightly or wrongly, supremely indferent to the question of where the PMs hand strayed  years ago. And the preoccupation with language they find almost comical. People use military metaphors all the time, like ldquostick to your guns.

Why  Because the politics of the PMs personal le and language plays well in the echo-chambers of Twitter, but not in focus groups, where people are bothered about pay, jobs, the NHS and Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.Im not so sure. Torsten Bell, of the low pay think tank the Resolution Foundation, takes it seriously and hailed it as ldquohugely ambitious.

The centre-ground has moved dramatically and suddenly to the left.Im not saying the PM has become a Marxist, but its striking that he has started to use the language of Keynesian economics. It is rare enough to hear a Tory advocate higher public spending. But Johnson is now echoing Labours argument that low interest rates are a unique opportunity for governments to make massive investments in infrastructure, new hospitals, gigabit broad-band etc.When did you last hear a Tory PM make the case for what is sometimes called ldquoPeoples Quantitative Easing  Margaret Thatcher would be appalled at this abandonment of fiscal prudence and Javids talk of the Tories being a ldquoworkers party. Even Tony Blair regarded redistribution and deficit financing as ldquoold Labour.Of course, a lot of what the PM says is probably electioneering: offering jam tomorrow and bagels after Brexit. But it also marks a big sht in the electoral ldquobattlegroundIm still allowed to use that term. Its a tribute to the work of parties like Labour and the SNP who have rehabilitated social democratic policies after three decades in the wilderness.Indeed, the Scottish National Partys policies, on the ldquosocial wage, borrowing and taxation, are beginning to look distinctly conservative, with a small ldquoc. Jeremy Corbyns policies on nationalisation, public spending, Universal Basic Services etc. no longer seem so extreme.The great moving left show is taking us into very interesting political territory, where many of the dogmas of the neoliberal era, which began with Margaret Thatchers monetarist experiments, are falling way. Im not sure where Brexit fits into all this, but it has clearly been a catalyst. Pressure from the ldquoleft behinds in provincial England has provoked a fracturing in the ideology of the right.People are fed up with austerity, low wages, crumbing infrastructure. They want big changes, not just in the way politicians talk, but what they actually do. I cant remember a time quite like this. Andthe Tories are actually talking left, I want to hear more of it. I want interviewers to interrogate the PM about these policies, and not just thigh-gate because we need to know just how seriously to take this new language.The personal may of of huge signicance to some people, but we should never forget that the political is political too, and thats important for all of us."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7329057.jpg?type=article-full","title":"abellio-says-move-end-scotrail-franchise-creates-staff-public-uncertainty","story":"Scottish Labour is to call to urge ministers on Wednesday not to extend the Abellio ScotRail contract beyond .Passengers have complained of delays, cancellations and overcrowding on the rail network.Ahead of the Opposition Day Debate, Abellio Scotrail has said it recognises the impact poor performance has on customersrsquo lives but said that any change would \"undermine the progress that has been made and be far more costly to the taxpayer\".Earlier this month, the Scottish Government put plans in place to run the railways as an \"operator of last resort\"ScotRails performance fails to improve.:Average of almost  trains a day cancelled byScotRailWhile the rail operator reports improvements, Scottish Labour insisted it was not enough - and has backed bringing the service back into public ownership.Dominic Booth, managing director of Abellio UK said: ldquoScotlandrsquos Railway needs stability and not the upheaval a change in the franchise would bring about.ldquoWe have delivered more services, more seats, more jobs and more investment at less cost to the taxpayer.ldquoAbellio ScotRail has also invested an additional poundmillion to improve our performance and we are on track to deliver the Remedial Plan commitments made to Transport Scotland.ldquoScottish Labourrsquos motion threatens not only the long term vision for Scotlandrsquos Railway, it creates uncertainty for thousands of staff and  million passengers across all of our communities.ldquoAny change would be far more costly to the taxpayer and will fail to deliver the benefits of this once in a generation investment.:Labour forces vote on endingScotRaildeal  years earlyIn a briefing paper, Abellio said that the railway network was being used more than ever before, serving nearly  million passengers a year.Abellio said that since First ran the railways, there had been a % rise in services, % more seats, % more staff and that the taxpayer subsidy was % less.\"We have overcome the late delivery, by suppliers, of % of our new trains and kept customers moving during Network Rail failures on track and signalling, delays to Network Rail projects such as the  week Queen Street tunnel closure and major weather disruptions like the recent flooding,\" Abellio said.In March, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a remedial plan put into place by ScotRail was its \"last chance saloon\".Abellio said: \"We know the impact poor performance has on customersrsquo lives, and it is no surprise that there has been anger and frustration.

The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But its integrity was soon called into question by members of the public, concerned that gravestones were being laid flat without clear notice. Meanwhile, a council insider accused the local authority of failing to abide by guidelines for testing the memorials.A report to this Thursday#s meeting of the Council#s Monitoring and Audit Committee has set out key findings, and has made a number of recommendations for how the programme should be improved for any future works.In all,  recommendations were made — with six described as high priority.According to an official statement from Orkney Islands Council, key findings of the report were that:The six high priority recommendations were that:According to OIC, a further five recommendations have already been progressed — these are:Additional recommendations included:According to OIC, progress in delivering and completing the actions that have been requested will be reported to future meetings.Work to re-erect headstones in Orkney#s cemeteries is continuing with five cemeteries now completed, and one more expected to be completed shortly.Work will also be getting underway to identy and make safe stones where required in the remainder of Orkney’s kirkyards as part of a continuous programme of public safety over the months and years ahead.The full report is available here  # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Files Committees-and-Agendas Monitoring-and-Audit MA MA-- I.__Burial_Grounds_Memorial_Safety__.pdf.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Irsquove seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.ldquoI lost my mother and now I watch my we falling victim to the same powerful forces. Harry said about his we: ldquoI have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long.

Dr Mohammad Zia Ul Haq Katshu, who treated the patient, wrote: ldquoHis we reported that since the EU referendum results were declared on  June , he started spending more time putting his thoughts across on social media.ldquoHe found it dficult to reconcile with the political events happening around him. He became increasingly worried about racial incidents. His sleep deteriorated.Once admitted, the unnamed patient was described as agitated, attempting to ldquoburrow through the hospital floor with his hands to ldquoget the hell out of this place.He believed he was being spied on and that talks on the radio were directed at him.He later said: ldquoI was looking at the electoral map of voting for the EU. I am in a constituency that reflects an opinion that is not for me.Dr Katshu warned that political events can act as ldquomajor psychological stressors in the article published in BMJ Case Reports. Previous surveys have shown that concerns over the future of the US after the  presidential elections and the Brexit referendum were signicant sources of stress.Dr Katshu added: ldquoHis mental health had deteriorated rapidly following the announcement of the results, with signicant concerns about Brexit.ldquoHe presented as agitated, confused and thought disordered. He had auditory hallucinations, and paranoid, referential, misidentication and bizarre delusions.The patient also reported experiencing family pressures and it is possible these and work-related stress also contributed to his illness.The patient was diagnosed with acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder, a category of acute and transient psychotic disorderndash the first case believed to have been triggered by Brexit.The illness is characterised by an acute onset of symptoms and complete recovery within three months.The patient described his experiences as ldquointense periods of accelerated thinking, of being distracted and consumed by my own thoughts, and of a series of theatrical episodes of which I am at the centre.He recovered completely within a fortnight after a brief admission and treatment with olanzapine, an anti-psychotic.He had experienced a similar episode  years previously following work-related stress.But he had no family history of mental health problems, history of alcohol or substance misuse, or physical health issues barring mildly impaired hearing in one ear.He has remained well up to June , when doctors last had contact with him.copy -.

This target is more ambitious than that set for the UK by some five years. In addition, an ambitious interim target of  per cent by  was also agreed.All this puts Scotland at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Encouragingly, there was a broad consensus across the Holyrood Chamber that this was the right thing to do, although, bizarrely, the Scottish Green Party MSPs abstained in the final vote, refusing to support the Bill which everyone  agreed to.The ambitious targets set last week don’t go far enough for some. I met a number of youth climate strikers outside Holyrood on Thursday, who were both articulate and passionate about their subject. Groups like Extinction Rebellion have certainly helped put tackling climate change at the centre of the political agenda, but on the fringes there is the whf of an end-of-times apocalyptic cult about some of their members.The measures that we are taking to reduce CO emissions are guided by the advice of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If their considered view on what needs to be done changes, then that is the time to take further action.: Why Holyrood must not betray Scotland’s climate strikers – Dr Richard DixonFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereOffshore wind getting cheaperIt also needs to be remembered, in all this debate, that Scotland amounts for a fraction of one per cent of global CO emissions. Meeting our climate change targets will come at a cost, both economically and socially, but the overall impact will do nothing to help save our planet unless the lead we are taking is followed by countries across the world.The point was fairly made in last week’s debate that the setting of targets, however robust, is the easy part what is harder is actually implementing the policies to ensure these targets are met. In the fields of energy, and transport, in particular, we will all have to make dferent choiceswe are to meet the targets we have set.Technological advances will be vital here. Last month saw the award of the latest Contract for Dference by the UK Government, demonstrating another substantial reduction in the cost of electricity generated by offshore wind. Nuclear power, while now relatively more expensive in terms of its unit cost, provides a reliability that other, intermittent, forms of low-carbon electricity generation struggle to meet.In the area of transport, we need to see a modal sht away from petrol and diesel-powered vehicles both to public transport and to inidual vehicles powered by low-carbon sources. Electric cars are still limited in range due to battery size, but as the technology improves costs will reduce, and they will become more attractive.In all this, we do have to be aware of the potential impact of any policy changes on social justice. The fuel duty escalator introduced by the previous Labour Government has now been frozen for eight years running. While it is perfectly possible to make an argument in terms of reducing carbon emissions that the escalator is a valuable policy tool, in practice it is a regressive tax that hits hardest on the poorest households.: Brexit and climate change leave farmers struggling – Alan White:  terrying ways climate change could affect your le in ScotlandUnfair taxes dressed up as ‘green’ policiesIn similar fashion, the SNP’s Workplace Parking Levy or “Car Park Tax”, which could hit those parking at their place of work with an annual charge of up to £, might well be dressed up as a “green” policy, but will hit hard at those who have no alternative but to use their private cars to get to their pace of work.Similarly, low-emission zones in city centres can be got around by those wealthy enough to buy more modern, low-emitting vehicles, but those who can only afford to buy a ten-year-old diesel car will find themselves effectively excluded from city centres. Raising the cost of aviation will mean that the wealthy can still travel by air, while pricing out those who simply want an annual family holiday to the Mediterranean.All this demonstrates why government policies are a blunt instrument which can often have unintended and negative consequences. And it illustrates why inidual responsibility, and personal choices, are as important in the fight against climate change as any legislation that might be passed.Because,we are serious about reducing CO, we will all need to be prepared to live our lives dferently. That means making choices that come at personal cost to ourselves: using the car less, flying less often, turning down the heating, and wasting less food.To give just one example: people will often make the claim thatonly public transport were better, they would make less use of their cars. And yes, public transport can and should be better, but the reality is that evenwe had the world’s best public transport in Scotland, it is still never as convenient as using your own vehicle. The best bus or train system in the world will not pick you up from your front door, and deliver you precisely to your exact destination, by your own preferred route. Using public transport as an alternative to a private car will always mean a sacrice, and it is simply a cop-out to say that we need better public transport before we can make that choice.We don’t need to be Greta Thunberg to realise that we need to take the threat of climate change much more seriously than we have done in the past. The Scottish Parliament has taken a signicant step forward with the legislation passed last week, but on its own it simply won’t be enough. We are all going to have to change our behaviours, and that is going to come at personal cost.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"article 50 supersedes benn act on brexit extension says jacob rees mogg","story":"Speaking on the recording of the Conservative Home podcast, Moggcast at the Conservative party conference in Manchester, Mr Rees-Mogg said the situation was \"very straightforward\".Despite this, Mr Rees-Mogg also admitted he does not see any \"easy and obvious loophole\" the Government could use to get around the Benn Act.: Brexit: Can the Queen actually sack Boris Johnson The Benn Act says the Prime Minister must ask the EU for an extension of the Article  negotiating period by  October, unless Parliament has approved a deal or a no-deal Brexit.When asked by a member of the public at the fringe event whether EU law and Article  supersede the Benn Act, Mr Rees-Mogg said: \"Yes it does, so its very straightforward.\"Mr Rees-Mogg continued: \"You may remember how we got the extension from  March.\"We did not get it by an Act of the UK Parliament, we got it because as long as the  European Communities Act is enforced, EU law is more powerful than UK law.\"So anything that is agreed at the EU level is our fundamental law overriding any domestic legislation.\"So Article  and EU law overrides the Benn Act, andDominic Grieve were here hed say the same thing.\"Mr Rees-Mogg was also pushed by an audience member on how the Government could get around the Benn Act, which requires the Prime Minister to write a letter to the EU requesting an extension.On possible legal loopholes the Government could exploit to avoid implementing the terms of the Benn Act, Mr Rees-Mogg added: \"The law is the law as it is.\"There is the very important question of how it interacts with EU law, but there is no easy and obvious loophole that I can sit here and tell you we can use, becausethere is I havent spotted it.\": Ian Blackford urges opposition leaders to unite to oust Boris JohnsonMr Rees-Mogg also told Conservative party members the  former Conservative MPs who had the Tory whip removed after voting against the Government should have the whip restoredthey can show they are willing to support the Government to deliver a Conservative programme.He said: \"I always believe in politics in being as generous as you possibly can be.\"But you cannot have a situation where people are trying to put Jeremy Corbyn in charge of the order paper.\"So, look,they are willing to show that they are willing to support a Conservative Government deliver a Conservative programme, and pull back from what they did before, I think generosity is in the nature of Conservatism, and the Conservative party is a broad church and needs to remain a broad church.\"He continued: \"Therefore we ought to be generous and we oughtnt to be ideological about who belongs to the Tory Party, we need to welcome people who are willing to make interesting arguments, but we cannot have a situation where people hand over the order paper to the Opposition.\"So how do we get on from here  Well, lets seethere are any other votes which give them the chance to come back, but I think a number of them are retiring and have no interest in coming back, so it wont be everybody.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"fracking ban decision to be unveiled by scottish government","story":"The Scottish Government is facing calls to unveil a legal ban on fracking when MSPs are updated on the issue this week.Energy minister Paul Wheelhouse is to make a statement to MSPs at Holyrood on Thursday and campaigners are now calling the issue to be put to rest once and for all.Two years ago energy minister Paul Wheelhouseannounced an \"effective ban\" on fracking in Scotland, but this was judges found this had no legal force after a court challenge was brought by petrochemical giant INEOS.Read more: Final decision on Scottish fracking ban delayedFriends of the Earth Scotland Head of Campaigns Mary Church said: “Ministers must live up their rhetoric and fulfil the promises of two years ago by committing to a full legal ban on fracking that will put this issue to bed once and for all.\"The effective ban announced  years ago has been exposed in court as having no legal force and was described by the Scottish Government’s own legal team as merely ‘the language of a press release’.Read more: Fracking court battle cost Scottish government £k“An expert legal opinion from earlier this year shows that not only is it well within the power of the Scottish Government to ban fracking, but that legislating would be a far more effective way to stop the industry and defeat any further legal challenges from companies like INEOS who want to frack the central belt.\"In response to a Scottish Government consultation on fracking, , people called for the industry to be stopped.

It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters. Consequently, the claim by David Cameron that he sought the Queen’s intervention during the Scottish referendum campaign has been reportedly the source of further displeasure in Buckingham Palace.This story originally appeared in the i. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Climate change is speeding up sea level rise and the increasing regularity of violent storm events means the coastal archaeology is also rapidly vanishing.#Please help us record the sites and the stories of everyday maritime Shetland before it is too late.”Moder Dy is run entirely voluntarily with the non-financial support of Shetland Amenity Trust, Archaeology Shetland and Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk . It also has the support of Burra History Group for the Burra Noost Project and is partnering with Bressay History Group to support their recording of Bressay noosts this summer.Costs such as the website, room hire, resources for free school visits and insurance have so far been financed by the directors. Money is slowly trickling in via donations, sponsorship, and profits from workshop ticket sales. The next workshop is being held in Unst on Saturday st June.The first step of applying to the National Lottery Heritage Fund has been successful, allowing Moder Dy – named after the dialect phrase for the mother wave – to apply for a pot of £, to run the Burra Noost Project.However, at least £, needs to be raised to match this grant funding. Donations and business sponsorshipwould help make the Burra Noost Project a reality and enable Moder Dy to record the ordinary lives of Shetland folk from the days when the four-oared boat was the equivalent to the family car today..."},{"url":null,"title":"dozen young sailors to join tall ships races ","story":"Sail Training Shetland sail trainees and sponsors on board the Faroese sailing smack Westward Ho at Victoria Pier.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Planning permission was granted in  and received approval from elected representatives on Belfast City Council having gone through all of the requisite planning procedures.The plans have been signicantly revised three times following consultation, resulting in a final plan which meets the school’s needs while making provision for extensive landscaped open space facilities for local residents.The sports provision as planned will occupy under fty per cent of the land available with the remainder proposed as a managed landscape development. In a letter addressed to FOGOG dated September , Mr Baker states that the project needs to proceed “within the approved plans”.“While there is no scope to amend the plans in these areas, the Department’s view remains that there are still a number of other areas where engagement between the residents and the school would be of great value.“As you are aware, a contractor is in place for this project and is ready to start on site.“As I stated at the meeting, it is the Department’s preference that this project can proceed in a manner that will benefit both the school and the community and I would urge you to consider the offer being made in a positive manner.”FOGOG have occupied Glassmullin green since August  when contractors, Haffey Sports Grounds, were due to begin work on the project. FOGOG have campaigned for the protection of the green space since , and described attempts to develop on the site as a “land grab”.De La Salle College have reiterated on several occasions that it has engaged in “considerable” and exhaustive “consultations” and modied plans three times to take into account the wishes of residents whilst still benefitting its pupils and “the whole community”.In his letter Derek Baker stated that there were four specic areas “where it will not be possible to make amendments”. Those areas are:•G pitch – following consultation in the earlier stages of this project, the size of the pitch has already been reduced. The current approved plan is for a m x m pitch, which is the minimum requirement to enable the school to have a useful facility for the delivery of the PE curriculum.School•Fencing – As you will appreciate, safeguarding of the De La Salle pupils is paramount, so the pitch needs a level of fencing. This will also have the benefit of protecting residents’ homes from stray balls.•Floodlighting – One of the key aspects of this project is that the pitch is available for community use outside of school hours and floodlighting is required to allow the community to maximize its use of the facility. While the provision of floodlights is central to the project, there is scope to review the hours of operation of the lights.•Pavilion – The pavilion is required for both school and community use and has already been reduced in size. It is simply not possible to further reduce the size of the pavilion and still have a facility, which meets the needs of the school and the community.However, in his communication to FOGOG, Mr Baker said that there are “still a number of areas” where engagement between the residents and the school “would be of great value”. The main areas are:•Hours of use of the facility•Sources of funding and the charging policy for community use of the facility•Landscaping of the Council area and•Nature of the G surface.Senior De La Salle College representatives told the Andersonstown News that the school “has always been and is still willing” to engage with FOGOG.“There has been extensive consultation on this project since it was first announced in January . As of September  the Department received an acknowledgement from FOGOG that they are considering the letter sent from Derek Baker and will be in touch in due course.“The delay on the project is costing thousands of pounds and this project will begin within the coming weeks.“We have made repeated efforts to engage, we want FOGOG to talk to us. Essentially these contractors have to go back onsite. This is a real passion for us.

The yard went into administration in August following the collapse of its Norwegian parent company.InfraStrata said it will retain the  workers who are still employed.Trade union Unite says it expects people toto work as early as this week. Unite regional officer Susan Fitzgerald said the workers had “defied the cynics”.SDLP Councillor Brian Heading welcomed news that a buyer had been found.Cllr Heading spearheaded efforts to bring together a coalition of public agencies to secure the shipyard after it fell into administration.“At last the shipyard workers have some positive news. They have fought tooth and nail to defend their livelihoods but also to secure one of Belfast’s most iconic industries. They deserve immense credit for their work over the last number of months,” he said.“What’s needed now is an economic strategy for the shipyard that will allow the site to grow and prosper. We have a real opportunity to create a green energy hub on the site, forging ahead with the assembly and manufacture of cutting edge wind technology. That’s where the economy of the future is and we should be preparing for it now.“I want to pay tribute to the immense strength and resilience of the shipyard workers and their trade union representatives who made this a pressing political priority.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lamh dhearg and portglenone get ready for part three","story":"BOTH Lámh Dhearg and Portglenone will be hoping it’s third time lucky in Ballymena this eveningas they meet once again to see who will advance into Sunday’s Antrim Senior Football Championship final.Thursday’s replay at Queen’s Arena was another night of high drama as Conall Delargy kicked an equaliser deep into stoppage time to force extra-time and Casement’s thought they had got it done as they led by one in the dying seconds of the additional period, only for Ben Rice to storm through and kick another equaliser with the last act of the game and force a free-kick contest.After five kicks each, the teams were level at - so it went to sudden death with the five kickers going again and all converted, prompting Antrim chairman Ciaran McCavana to step in and offer the teams the opportunity of another game to decide it in a more orthodox manner.His decision mostly drew praise from throughout the county and it was also applauded by Lámh Dhearg manager, Mairtín Lynch, who felt McCavana did the right thing.“I thought it was terribly brave of the county board a to advocate this and they should be given great praise for what they did,” he said.“Both teams need massive respect because they#ve brought tremendous goodwill to Antrim football. Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shirleyvalentine-digitalad-anderstown.png","title":"residents in stand off with contractors at glassmullin green","story":"CAMPAIGNERS opposed to the development of a new sports facility at Glassmullin Green have continued to occupy the space as contractors attempted to move on site this morning.Education NI has provided £.million for the project, which would see a G pitch, car park and pavilion built for De La Salle College.Work was initially due to begin on August , with Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds leaving the site following intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the green space since .FOGOG have occupied the site for the past seven weeks and have opposed today#s attempts by contractors to begin work on the development.La Salle has previously faced accusations of failing to properly engage with residents, who have described the plans as a #land grab#.

I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.“I lost my mother and now I watch my we falling victim to the same powerful forces.”My we has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against iniduals with no thought to the consequencesHarry said about his we: “I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.”The couple are coming to the end of a -day tour of southern Africa with son Archie which has received favourable coverage, but the duke said these positive publications exposes the “double standards of this specic press pack”.Meghan has launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday newspaper over an allegation it unlawfully published the letter to her father.Law firm Schillings, representing the duchess, said she had filed a High Court claim against the paper and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement ofand breach of the Data Protection Act .In the statement published on the duke and duchess’s official website, Harry said he and Meghan believed in “media freedom and objective, truthful reporting” as a “cornerstone of democracy”.Addressing readers, he added: “Unfortunately, my we has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against iniduals with no thought to the consequences – a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.“There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specically when it is knowingly  and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face – as so many of you can relate to – I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.”It is understood the couple did not take legal action lightly, but the timing of the announcement will over overshadow the final day of their Africa tour on Wednesday.In February, the Mail on Sunday published extracts of Meghan’s handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle. In one extract, published by the newspaper, the duchess wrote: “Your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces – not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this. Something I will never understand.”In the run up to the wedding, Mr Markle was caught up in controversy after he allegedly staged paparazzi photographs of himself and then began commenting regularly to entertainment website TMZ about his contact with his daughter.Harry explained that the alleged unlawful publication of the private letter was done in “an intentionally destructive manner” to “manipulate” readers.He claimed readers were misled by “strategically omitting select paragraphs, specic sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year”.He added: “There comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives.“Put simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn’t acceptable, at any level.“We won’t and can’t believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.”A spokeswoman for law firm Schillings claimed the “intrusive” publication of the letter was part of Associated Newspaper’s campaign to write “ and deliberately derogatory stories about” Meghan, “as well as her husband”.A Mail on Sunday spokesman said: “The Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.“Specically, we categorically deny that the duchess’s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.”"},{"url":null,"title":"senior mp mortified after tory conference clash with security","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is already producing huge seas over the North Atlantic, according to the hurricane centre.Severe weather conditions are not uncommon in the exposed island chain, but hurricanes have usually eased by the time they reach the area’s cooler waters.Nuno Moreira, head of the weather department at Portugal’s Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere, said Lorenzo is so big it is taking longer than usual to weaken.“It’s a rare event … but not unique,” Mr Moreira said, noting that two storms of similar strength hit the islands in the s.Scientic studies have indicated the Azores should expect more powerful cyclones in the future due to climate change, Mr Moreira said, as the atmosphere and oceans heat up.The centre of Lorenzo is expected to pass near the western Azores early on Wednesday.The Azores regional government sent crews out to clear drainage systems during calm daytime weather on Tuesday and told residents to prepare their homes. It also cancelled Wednesday classes at schools and told government workers to stay at home, except for emergency workers."},{"url":null,"title":"nasa lander captures marsquakes and other martian sounds","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The rest could be marsquakes — or something . The French seismometer is so sensitive it can hear the Martian wind as well as movements by the lander’s robot arm and other mechanical “dinks and donks” as the team calls them.One of our favorite DJs, @NASAInSight, just dropped some new Martian beats!

Scientists are trying to salvage the experiment to measure the planet’s internal temperature.The so-called mole is meant to penetrate ft beneath the Martian surface, but has managed barely ft.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: DCSDC Health and Community Committee and UNISON Community Branch Activists."},{"url":null,"title":"newtown volunteers working around clock look kittens","story":"There are more kittens to be adopted in Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensNewtown Cats Protection is looking for people to adopt kittens.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensMore kittens are in need of adoption in Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensOne of the kittens up for adoption Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensNewtown Cats Protection staff are hoping to see more kittens adopted.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensCats protection logo.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"newtown youngsters strike climate change","story":"Climate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Pictured left to right, Kylie DaviesSophie WeaverRuby White, Lyssie Jarvisalt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Newtown youngsters strike about climate changeClimate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Newtown youngsters strike about climate changeClimate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"unique mix entertainment offer bishops castles michaelmas fair","story":"Barrel organ player, Dave Hill entertains crowds at this year#s Michaelmas Fltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtair.

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class.

Several of them would be subjected to severe political pressurethey made a decision to close on Monday.At the outset of the discussion the boardrsquos chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, said he did not wish to open debate on the already widely discussed issue. The allocation of exceptional holidays remained a matter of departmental policy whatever board members might think inidually.Mrs Ethel Smyth said the matter was causing great concern in the area and that she had already condemned Lord Elton for the action he had taken in offering Monday as an exceptional holiday.Only a native lord from England would have made such a mistake. In her view, it might have been quite proper for the Roman Catholic maintained schools take one of their ten optional days holidays to see their spiritual leader of their church.In all but one of the controlled schools in her area good sense had prevailed and those schools would remain open on Monday.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision. But it secured a reprieve as a result of pressure from local politicians, including Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.Contractors are currently hard at work restoring and extending the facility which commands spectacular views over the country park from the front of the building and Strangford Lough from the rear.Cllr Walker, who for many years has been campaigning for more investment in the country park to provide an enhanced range of attractions for visitors, said many people were looking forward to seeing the councilrsquos future vision for Delamont.He said the country park was one of the best of its kind in the province and offered ldquounlimited development potential.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoIt is important that when the vision for the future is unveiled that local people are given an opportunity to study the document and provide comment on it.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and it is important that the local council presses ahead with its own investment plan to make Delamont even better, capitalising on its huge development potential.Delamont currently operates a hugely successful miniature railway, cafe, stunning walks and childrenrsquos adventure playground, but Cllr Walker believes so much more can be done.He added: ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.ldquoSecuring finance to enhance the country park is critical to its future development and I hope others funders will join with the council on this issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Resurfacing.jpg","title":"Resurfacing work set to start in Irish Street  ","story":"WORK to resurface Irish Street in Downpatrick following the completion of a pound, public realm scheme is expected to start imminently.Roads officials have indicated that concerns about the state of a derelict building close to the townrsquos former police base have been addressed, paving the way for resurfacing work to start.It was revealed last month that the project had been delayed due to issues over insurance and that the work could not take place until these are resolved.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he has been told by roads officials that concerns about the derelict building have been ironed out and that resurfacing work will begin.Work on the regeneration project was due to be completed by March, but it was the end of June before contractors finally moved off site, with traders in the area expressing anger about the impact the delayed scheme was having on business.The delay also had a knock-on effect on traffic congestion in other parts of the town as a result of the temporary one-way traffic system in Irish Street.Managed by the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities and Newry Mourne and Down Council, the scheme has resulted in new granite paving, street lighting and street furniture.The delay in completing the public realm work within the anticipated three-month timeframe was blamed on a number of factors, described as ldquounforeseen works issues, that resulted in the loss of construction time and delays in delivering the scheme.Issues which arose included the identication of asbestos piping along both sides of Irish Street which resulted in the works contract being put on hold for eight weeks. In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town. The street has been transformed as a result of signicant investment which was long overdue.Cllr Curran said a new group was formed in July to oversee a pound, scheme to help revitalise shop fronts at Irish Street, with the so-called lsquorevitalisation fundingrsquo provided by the Department for Communities and local authority to help business owners improve the fronts of their respective properties.A working group to steer the project forward has been formed, with traders encouraged to come up with schemes to improve shop fronts.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThis is a timely initiative given what the Irish Street traders had to endure for the first six months of the year. It is also important that whatever schemes come forward that the character of this part of the town is retained.ldquoThere are also plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.ldquoI lost my mother and now I watch my we falling victim to the same powerful forces. Harry said about his we: ldquoI have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.The couple are coming to the end of a -day tour of southern Africa with son Archie which has received favourable coverage, but the duke said these positive publications exposes the ldquodouble standards of this specic press pack.Meghan has launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday newspaper over an allegation it unlawfully published the letter to her father.Law firm Schillings, representing the duchess, said she had filed a High Court claim against the paper and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement ofand breach of the Data Protection Act .In the statement published on the duke and duchessrsquos official website, Harry said he and Meghan believed in ldquomedia freedom and objective, truthful reporting as a ldquocornerstone of democracy.Addressing readers, he added: ldquoUnfortunately, my we has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against iniduals with no thought to the consequences ndash a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.ldquoThere is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specically when it is knowingly  and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face ndash as so many of you can relate to ndash I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.It is understood the couple did not take legal action lightly, but the timing of the announcement will over overshadow the final day of their Africa tour on Wednesday.In February, the Mail on Sunday published extracts of Meghanrsquos handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle. In one extract, published by the newspaper, the duchess wrote: ldquoYour actions have broken my heart into a million pieces ndash not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this. Something I will never understand.In the run up to the wedding, Mr Markle was caught up in controversy after he allegedly staged paparazzi photographs of himself and then began commenting regularly to entertainment website TMZ about his contact with his daughter.Harry explained that the alleged unlawful publication of the private letter was done in ldquoan intentionally destructive manner to ldquomanipulate readers.He claimed readers were misled by ldquostrategically omitting select paragraphs, specic sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year.He added: ldquoThere comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives.ldquoPut simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isnrsquot acceptable, at any level.ldquoWe wonrsquot and canrsquot believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.A spokeswoman for law firm Schillings claimed the ldquointrusive publication of the letter was part of Associated Newspaperrsquos campaign to write ldquo and deliberately derogatory stories about Meghan, ldquoas well as her husband.A Mail on Sunday spokesman said: ldquoThe Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.ldquoSpecically, we categorically deny that the duchessrsquos letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Harry accuses tabloid press of  uruthless campaign u against Meghan article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Irsquove seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.ldquoI lost my mother and now I watch my we falling victim to the same powerful forces. Harry said about his we: ldquoI have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.The couple are coming to the end of a -day tour of southern Africa with son Archie which has received favourable coverage, but the duke said these positive publications exposes the ldquodouble standards of this specic press pack.Meghan has launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday newspaper over an allegation it unlawfully published the letter to her father.Law firm Schillings, representing the duchess, said she had filed a High Court claim against the paper and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement ofand breach of the Data Protection Act .In the statement published on the duke and duchessrsquos official website, Harry said he and Meghan believed in ldquomedia freedom and objective, truthful reporting as a ldquocornerstone of democracy.Addressing readers, he added: ldquoUnfortunately, my we has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against iniduals with no thought to the consequences ndash a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.ldquoThere is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specically when it is knowingly  and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face ndash as so many of you can relate to ndash I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.It is understood the couple did not take legal action lightly, but the timing of the announcement will over overshadow the final day of their Africa tour on Wednesday.In February, the Mail on Sunday published extracts of Meghanrsquos handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle. In one extract, published by the newspaper, the duchess wrote: ldquoYour actions have broken my heart into a million pieces ndash not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this. Something I will never understand.In the run up to the wedding, Mr Markle was caught up in controversy after he allegedly staged paparazzi photographs of himself and then began commenting regularly to entertainment website TMZ about his contact with his daughter.Harry explained that the alleged unlawful publication of the private letter was done in ldquoan intentionally destructive manner to ldquomanipulate readers.He claimed readers were misled by ldquostrategically omitting select paragraphs, specic sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year.He added: ldquoThere comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives.ldquoPut simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isnrsquot acceptable, at any level.ldquoWe wonrsquot and canrsquot believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.A spokeswoman for law firm Schillings claimed the ldquointrusive publication of the letter was part of Associated Newspaperrsquos campaign to write ldquo and deliberately derogatory stories about Meghan, ldquoas well as her husband.A Mail on Sunday spokesman said: ldquoThe Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.ldquoSpecically, we categorically deny that the duchessrsquos letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Harry accuses tabloid press of  uruthless campaign u against Meghan article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Dr Mohammad Zia Ul Haq Katshu, who treated the patient, wrote: ldquoHis we reported that since the EU referendum results were declared on  June , he started spending more time putting his thoughts across on social media.ldquoHe found it dficult to reconcile with the political events happening around him. He became increasingly worried about racial incidents. His sleep deteriorated.Once admitted, the unnamed patient was described as agitated, attempting to ldquoburrow through the hospital floor with his hands to ldquoget the hell out of this place.He believed he was being spied on and that talks on the radio were directed at him.He later said: ldquoI was looking at the electoral map of voting for the EU. I am in a constituency that reflects an opinion that is not for me.Dr Katshu warned that political events can act as ldquomajor psychological stressors in the article published in BMJ Case Reports. Previous surveys have shown that concerns over the future of the US after the  presidential elections and the Brexit referendum were signicant sources of stress.Dr Katshu added: ldquoHis mental health had deteriorated rapidly following the announcement of the results, with signicant concerns about Brexit.ldquoHe presented as agitated, confused and thought disordered. He had auditory hallucinations, and paranoid, referential, misidentication and bizarre delusions.The patient also reported experiencing family pressures and it is possible these and work-related stress also contributed to his illness.The patient was diagnosed with acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder, a category of acute and transient psychotic disorderndash the first case believed to have been triggered by Brexit.The illness is characterised by an acute onset of symptoms and complete recovery within three months.The patient described his experiences as ldquointense periods of accelerated thinking, of being distracted and consumed by my own thoughts, and of a series of theatrical episodes of which I am at the centre.He recovered completely within a fortnight after a brief admission and treatment with olanzapine, an anti-psychotic.He had experienced a similar episode  years previously following work-related stress.But he had no family history of mental health problems, history of alcohol or substance misuse, or physical health issues barring mildly impaired hearing in one ear.He has remained well up to June , when doctors last had contact with him..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: First reported case of Brexit-triggered psychosis presented by doctor article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"around  jobs lost as wrightbus enters administration","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Around , jobs have been lost after Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus entered administration. The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.
