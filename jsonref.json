That’s why Jodie Humphries, 41, welcomed the announcement that the National Insurance threshold will rise.The mother of two, who runs her own digital marketing business from home, said: ‘That’s great, it’s a small amount but every little helps.‘We’re hoping to extend our house and we need to remortgage, so with borrowing rates going down, every saving we can make in every direction will go into that.’Mrs Humphries also welcomed the fuel duty freeze as her video producer husband Richard, 48, commutes to London for work from their home in Maidenhead, Berkshire.They also sometimes take their children, seven-year-old Anya and four-year-old Adam, to visit family in Birmingham and Cardiff. Mrs Humphries said: ‘It’ll help on those long journeys.’         Grateful: Richard and Jodie Humphries with children Adam, four, and Anya, sevenCandle shop owner welcomes plans to support small businesses Luxury candle shop owner Drew Cockton welcomed plans to support small businesses through the difficulties caused by the corona-virus outbreak.The 33-year-old, whose company also makes the high-end candles in the North West, said the business rate holiday was ‘fantastic’.Mr Cockton, founder of Owen Drew Luxury Candles of Birkenhead, Merseyside, said: ‘We’ve just had a business rates bill through and it’s absolutely ridiculous, the amount.         Drew Cockton (pictured) welcomed plans to support small businesses through the difficulties caused by the corona-virus outbreak‘In Birkenhead the town centre is struggling, and we pay for the privilege of being here while we’re trying to improve the area.’He said it is ‘fantastic news’ that small businesses like his with a rateable value below £51,000 will not pay any rates for a year.Recently the candlemaker had to let someone go due to challenging conditions, so the Government paying for sick pay for employees off due to coronavirus is also a relief for Mr Cockton.He said: ‘We’re a small business, we employ only six people and being a business owner is hard, some months I hardly get paid so it would be massive for us if we had someone off and had to pay them because of coronavirus. So that is very welcome help.’Increases to business rates and the minimum wage have put pressure on his bottom line. His company will save around £14,000 next year from the business rate holiday, money which is especially welcome as footfall is down, something he blames on the virus.He said he will use some of the money saved from the cut to invest in exporting his candles overseas.He said: ‘Our products have a “Made in England” tag on them which is popular in America and China so that could be a lucrative side of the business, but we can’t really invest in it at the moment.’After trading online for a number of years the luxury candlemaker opened his first high street shop a year ago.He also hopes that moves to raise the National Insurance threshold will have some trickle down benefits to his business.Mr Cockton said: ‘The retail side of the economy is struggling at the moment so more money in people’s pockets is as good thing, it means its back in shops, restaurants and bars. It helps everyone.’Specialist shoemaker welcomes statutory sick pay announcement The Government\u0027s decision to finance the statutory sick pay of employees affected by the coronavirus for two weeks was celebrated by businesswoman Jennifer Bailey.She runs a company in Manchester called Calla Shoes, which sells stylish footwear to women with problem feet.As a small business, wages to staff – and sick pay – form a large part of costs. Miss Bailey, pictured, employs four people and aims to take on more as the company grows. The 42-year-old said: ‘It’s fantastic because it means as a small employer you’re not having to pay sick pay for people you weren’t really expecting to. It has an effect on cash flow so it is welcome news.’However she was not impressed with some other policies, particularly the cut to entrepreneur relief.If she achieves her goals and sells her business for a significant sum, the reforms could cost her hundreds of thousands of pounds.She said: ‘There are lots of people who are in the same boat and the government haven’t sorted anything to replace it to incentivise people.’Help for doctors caught out by the pension tax trap Consultant psychiatrist Dr Kate Lovett was last year hit with a shock £169,000 tax bill she feared would mean she had to quit working for the NHS.Dr Lovett, Dean of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, last night welcomed the Chancellor’s move to help doctors caught out by the pension tax trap.She said it was particularly important that doctors did not fear taking on extra work during the coronavirus crisis.         Consultant psychiatrist Dr Kate Lovett (pictured) was last year hit with a shock £169,000 tax bill she feared would mean she had to quit working for the NHSDr Lovett, pictured, considered remortgaging her home to cover the tax bill she got in September.It was not until January that she discovered she had been overcharged £83,000 after a financial adviser offered to review her case. Despite the Budget, she is still having to pay a tax bill over £80,000. The 52-year-old, who works in Plymouth, Devon, said: ‘It is very positive that the Government has clearly listened to concerns and acknowledged the negative impact on the medical workforce. But it won’t remove the fear of debt or the impact of accrued debt.’She said the system remained complex and many doctors would still worry about exceeding their pension tax allowance.Dr Lovett added: ‘It is a positive step in the right direction for reforming what is a very complicated system.’  LOSERS  Entrepreneurs\u0027 Relief slashed  Amanda Thomson is furious that Entrepreneurs\u0027 Relief has been slashed.She is the founder of Thomson \u0026amp Scott, an online business that sells organic, vegan and alcohol-free sparkling wines. Removing the tax break could cost her hundreds of thousands if she sells her business in the future.She will effectively be paying 20 per cent capital gains tax on any sum she receives as opposed to 10 per cent.          Feeling flat: Prosecco business owner Amanda ThomsonShe said that the Chancellor had bought into the ‘rhetoric of the rich getting richer but the irony is that it is those of us who go all in and really grow the economy who are affected.’ The tax relief was not just for the rich, she said, adding: ‘None of my entrepreneur friends are wealthy, white men.’Some of the cash from any future sale of her London-based business is earmarked for investing in young women starting their companies.But with the six-figure hike to her tax bill when she sells up, Amanda is unsure if she will be able to do as much for the next generation as she had hoped.20million facing lower rates from National SavingsSavers were left short-changed yesterday when the Chancellor pulled the purse strings even tighter at National Savings and Investments.Rishi Sunak ordered the agency to take in 40 per cent less cash than last year – meaning rates for more than 20million customers are likely to fall further. This is because it will not now be trying to lure in business with attractive rates.The blow came hours after the Bank of England slashed the base rate to 0.25 per cent, paving the way for banks to offer record low rates. Savers have endured paltry rewards ever since the 2008 financial crisis sent interest rates tumbling. Last month NS\u0026ampI announced it was reducing payouts – including for the 21million customers with Premium Bonds.But the Budget brought more bad news as the Treasury announced it would cut the amount of money the bank can bring in, from £10.1billion to £6billion. Last month NS\u0026ampI announced it would cut rates on 14 savings products. The prize rate for those with Premium Bonds was cut from the equivalent of 1.4 per cent to 1.3 per cent. It means savers are now less likely to win a cash prize in the monthly draws that include two £1million jackpots.Experts last night warned more prizes are likely to be taken off the table after the Budget, while rates would fall on other NS\u0026ampI accounts. Rachel Springall, of financial data firm Moneyfacts, said: ‘NS\u0026ampI is not likely to offer good returns to savers following the drop in the amount of money it wants to bring in.’Anna Bowes, of advice site Savings Champion, said: ‘This is devastating news for savers who have lived with record low savings rates for over a decade. They have already seen rates cuts accelerate over the last couple of months. Things will get worse.’The only hint of good news for savers yesterday was a hike in the amount of money parents can put away in to a Junior Isa every year.From next month, the limit for tax free savings will double from the current £4,368 to £9,000. The £20,000 cap for ordinary Isas is to stay in place. Becky O’Connor, personal finance specialist at mutual Royal London, said: ‘Most people save far less into them than the maximum. So raising the threshold is a bit of an empty gesture for all but the wealthiest Isa savers, who are the most likely to reach this maximum amount.’The change means parents could build up a pot of £240,000 over 18 years if they put in the maximum and it grows by 4 per cent every year.Neil Lovatt, from Scottish Friendly, said: ‘This increase will only serve the rich, wealthy and well advised and not the millions of parents and grandparents who want to save and invest for their children.’Martin Lewis of moneysavingexpert.com said those ‘who’ve worked hard to build up a nest egg will be holding their heads in their hands’ at news of the Bank’s base rate cut.The rate on Income Bonds, which are popular with pensioners as they pay interest each month, will suffer the most dramatic drop – from 1.15 per cent to 0.7 per cent. It means someone with £50,000 will lose out on £225 a year.Various bond rates are also being axed by a minimum of 0.15 percentage points."},{"url":null,"title":"VICTORIA BISCHOFF Rishi Sunaks budget kicking savers theyre down","story":"Share this article This is terrible news for 25 million loyal NS\u0026ampI savers who were hit with a punishing round of rate cuts only last month.And when NS\u0026ampI cuts its rates, banks and building societies almost always swiftly follow suit.If a Chancellor’s first Budget sets out the Government’s priorities, there can be no doubt that savers are slap bang at the bottom of its list. Money Mail launched its Stop Short-Changing Savers campaign to fight for a fairer deal for the nation’s downtrodden savers.So we were bitterly disappointed that, despite savers having suffered more than a decade of rock-bottom rates, Mr Sunak couldn’t find it within himself to offer them so much as a word of encouragement or even a hint of incentive – never mind a desperately needed rabbit out of the hat.The only bit of good news was that the amount families can save into a Junior Isa each year has been more than doubled to £9,000.But frankly, this will help only the very wealthy who can afford to put away such a large sum for their children.What about the millions of adult savers desperate for a respectable return on their cash?In the wake of Black Monday – after the coronavirus caused trading on Wall Street to be suspended temporarily – many will be even more nervous than usual when looking to the stock market for answers. And while investing is important for building up long-term savings and pensions, it is still vital people have a cash cushion for emergencies.It is entirely understandable, given how much chaos the coronavirus is causing, that this Budget needed to focus on boosting the economy and keeping people spending as much as possible.But savers haven’t just been ignored, they’ve been kicked while they are down.The Covid-19 crisis is also a stark reminder of the importance of having a rainy day fund – particularly for self-employed workers.So you would think that given the startling statistics around how few people have enough money squirrelled away, creating an incentive to save would be beneficial. But for now at least, it looks as though the misery is set to continue.Or as Rishi might say: ‘Abandon savers? We got it done.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Aspiring designer 16 makes dress 1 000 pages Daily Mail Mail Sunday","story":"Share this article Madeleine\u0027s mother Wendy, 54, said of her daughter: \u0027Once she gets going on something she\u0027s passionate about, she doesn\u0027t stop.\u0027The teenager, from Waterlooville, Hampshire, attends Chichester College, West Sussex, and has been interested in fashion and design since she was three.

But I shot them in 1984 and have worked with them ever since’My aim when shooting a show is to give somebody something they would not normally have seen. And to create an image that is unusual or exciting, so when people who went to the show look at it, they see something that’s special. People who shoot shows tend to panic, but if you do that, you get nothing. Stand back and wait. Think about what you’re doing – I learned that from Fin Costello. I don’t find it hard to get original images from live shows, because I know what I’m doing – I’ve done it for so long. Nowadays, a lot of bands want to control everything and they ban photographers from shows. Yet they’re quite happy, having thrown out the people doing it properly, to let anybody take bad pictures or film it on an iPhone.I first shot Metallica in 1984. Their drummer, Lars Ulrich, would call me me up, and I kept avoiding him. I’d seen pictures of him, and I thought he was just this Danish guy who looked like a complete idiot. But then Metallica’s manager, Peter Mensch, called me and said: “Listen, stop being such an asshole. Go to San Francisco and shoot my new band.” So I did, and that was the start of my relationship with them. In fact, the only reason I ended up shooting Metallica was because they wanted Iron Maiden’s photographer – I was working for them at the time. To Metallica, Led Zeppelin (who I also worked with) meant nothing. But Iron Maiden meant something and Metallica wanted their photographer. I’ve worked with them ever since. I’ll give the group their due: they are very conscious of who they are, what they do and how they want to be photographed. But they are also very open to doing different things.I am a rock photographer, not just hard rock or metal. I am particularly known for metal because I worked for Kerrang! magazine in the 80s, but that was more because instead of going to Leeds to shoot the Pet Shop Boys, I could go to Hawaii to do Aerosmith. Where would you rather go? And at the time the National Union of Journalists made sure that if you shot colour you were paid twice as much as for black and white, and Kerrang! was full colour.The worst photoshoot I ever did was the first time I worked with Led Zeppelin in 1979. I was young, and really impressed. Robert Plant walked up to me and said: “Do you know how to take a Robert Plant photo?” He poked me in the chest and said, quite nastily: “Quickly.” I was shooting a cover for Sounds magazine, and I did the shoot, but I was so nervous that I did Plant’s photoshoot, not mine. I did what he wanted, which resulted in a very boring picture. I came away and I thought: “I will never let anyone do that to me again,” and I never have. I was so naive that he completely threw me. Don’t let them do that to you, because if you do, you are just going to get a boring portrait.Training: A course in fine art at Wimbledon College of Art.High point: My Jimmy Page picture getting displayed in the National Portrait Gallery.Low point: Shooting the first Spice Girls US tour.

No. The origin in fact lies in the old proverb warning that you shouldn’t sell a bear’s skin before you have caught the bear. In the 18th century, speculators who did sell borrowed commodities before they had paid for them – in anticipation of profiting from a fall in price – were therefore called “bearskin jobbers”, later shortened to “bears”.So bears expect the value of investments to go down. By contrast, those who expected prices to go up came to be called “bulls”, perhaps because that beast is famously headstrong and incautious.

What do the measures he announced mean?A rapid response to Covid-19 was essential in Rishi Sunak’s first budget to staunch the threat to small businesses and workers bereft of work, facing the unknown. His “whatever it takes” for the NHS will be needed just to see that threadbare service through.For the rest, look at the numbers and you might think this splurging Keynesian budget must be Labour-designed, surely? But look at how it’s spent and you know at once it’s true-blue Tory, a Boris Johnson crowd-pleaser, a popular drink-and-drive budget, running on miles of new roads.Look north? Where people live matters less than how incomes are shared, when London has more people living below the poverty line per head than anywhere else. There’s no reform of regressive council tax in the budget: a top band two-bed semi in Blackpool worth £130,000 pays £1,624, while a £67.5m nine-bed mansion in Mayfair pays just £1,508. Without digging into these deep inequalities, there is no levelling up.Here’s the crux of the issue: Sunak echoes Johnson’s pretence that this is “the beginning of a new era”. But the Tories may struggle to wipe from the public memory those 10 years of slash-and-burn budgets they all voted for, when it will take years more for the public realm to recover.It was the new Toryism on steroids. Rishi Sunak delivered a budget that tore up the Treasury’s old rules on capital spending, provided a £30bn stimulus to fight coronavirus and a £100bn increase in public service spending by the end of this parliament: close your eyes and at times this could have been a budget delivered by a Labour chancellor rather than a Tory government in its 10th year.Instead, it heralds a new approach for a Conservative party that has once again shape-shifted in a bid to keep up with the times. Sunak’s debut budget saw the chancellor pledge sums of money that would usually be classed as eye-watering by Tory standards. But the spending spree is not all that surprising.Much of what was announced – from cuts to national insurance to funding for the NHS – was set out during the Tory election campaign. On top of this, Sunak unveiled an extensive package of measures to help businesses find a way through coronavirus turbulence and attempted to flesh out the government’s much-hyped level-up agenda. He went out of his way to pledge new funds for the metro mayors – with a special shout out for the West Midlands mayor Andy Street, as well as requests by Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen for local projects met. With the local elections in May, the Tories are taking no chances when it comes to consolidating their new “blue wall” seats.The most extraordinary thing about the budget was watching Tory MPs cheer as each spending pledge was announced. These MPs took to social media and WhatsApp to heap praise on Sunak for his smooth delivery and presence. One jokes that the big loser of the budget was Sajid Javid – who resigned last month over No 10 staffing issues. Since then, his allies have been keen to depict Sunak as a puppet of No 10.However, this budget ought to have done enough to make people at least think twice. While Sunak did find money for Dominic Cummings’ pet Arpa research project, he also did a few things his way. For now, Sunak will stick with Javid’s fiscal rules that limit day-to-day borrowing – with a decision to review in the autumn. While Tory MPs are roundly impressed with a budget delivered against the most difficult of backdrops, some sense that there could be trouble along the way. It couldn’t exactly be described as a revenue-raising budget and it isn’t yet clear how the government intends to pay for the coronavirus package. If there are unpopular decisions to be taken, they will have to come later in the parliament – and closer to the next election. Sunak has passed his first test but his next test – the autumn budget – will be even harder.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editorIn his first budget, Sunak delivered on the measly tax changes proposed in the forgettable Conservative election manifesto. The change to entrepreneurs’ relief is welcome, but far less significant than the moral outrage of the creation of a tax loophole so large it was visible from space in the first place. The novice chancellor eschewed the ambition of his hazard-prone predecessor and swerved away from a mooted “mansion tax” or straightforward wealth tax.But the truth is that there is no sustainable end to austerity without asking those at the top to contribute more. The tax changes were only remarkable for the lack of ambition that they reveal: there was no serious attempt to tax the wealthiest in society. Even basic steps such as taxing income from wealth at the same rate as income from work – as it was under Nigel Lawson in the 1980s – were notably absent. The youthful and ambitious new chancellor shows no signs of upsetting the Tory base.Once again, a Conservative government has claimed that austerity has come to an end without bothering to find the means to pay for higher levels of investment, thus revealing the moral bankruptcy of the project to slash the state. Indeed, the important increases in public investment (rising to the highest level since 1955) cannot compensate for the depleted stock of public assets as a result of 10 years of austerity, decades of underinvestment and the use of privatisation receipts to finance tax giveaways for the better-off.If Sunak were serious about changing the economy, he would have had the courage to confront the vested interests that have profited as others have had misery inflicted upon them. The failure to find the political courage shows that Sunak belongs squarely in the tradition of his Tory predecessors. The gap between rhetoric and reality remains as yawning as that between rich and poor.• Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economicsThe chancellor said he would do whatever it takes to respond to the Covid-19 outbreak, and has set aside a £5bn emergency package to help the NHS. The urgency this shows on coronavirus is welcome. The tragedy is that it doesn’t show the same urgency about an even bigger crisis in the making. The recent floods are a sobering reminder that climate change is here and it will have a devastating impact on people’s homes, livelihoods and communities. In the year that the government is hosting the 26th UN climate change conference of the parties (COP26), this should have been a climate budget. While more capital investment was welcome, not enough of this was directed at the infrastructure to get to a zero-carbon economy. We needed more investment directed into low-carbon public transport, home insulation, heating and reforestation. Instead we got £1bn new investment in green transport solutions and £1bn extra a year in flood defences. This pales in comparison to the £27bn investment in roads and the continued fuel-duty freeze – indicating the government still doesn’t get it.Nor was there a clear plan for how we would help communities across the country manage the transition that must come in a way that is just and fair. If the government is serious about levelling up, it needs to take this head on. Of the 4m UK jobs in sectors that are most vulnerable to the transition, the highest densities are across councils in the north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber and the Midlands. The government needed to set out a plan for how it would direct resources and give powers to local areas to develop local industrial strategies. But there was no mention of this in the budget. We’ve seen what the government can do in an emergency. We need the same focus, commitment and investment in response to the climate emergency. Let’s hope the Treasury’s net-zero review later this year delivers.• Miatta Fahnbulleh is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3785a11bbbf6f41acf60903e6393135000896cf0/0_21_4226_2536/master/4226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7746b747ec723b930fa974b1a20c3bd7","title":"rishi sunak budget tories british politics","story":"On 11 March 1952, Rab Butler unveiled the first Conservative budget since the second world war. It was also the first Tory budget since Labour’s creation of the National Health Service. It marked a political turning point for the Tory party. In that budget, not only did Butler become the first and last Tory chancellor of the postwar era to raise the basic rate of income tax – he also began the Tory party’s steady accommodation with key aspects of Labour’s postwar settlement, which lasted until Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.Rishi Sunak did not raise taxes on Wednesday. But the about-turn on public borrowing was almost as spectacular. For a Tory chancellor to say, as Sunak did, that “investment and higher growth mean more jobs and higher wages” is a U-turn. The burying of austerity (though not yet of its effects) is decisive. The role of the state was central to everything. Sunak said enough to suggest that his 2020 budget may even be a political turning point on a par with Butler’s, if it is carried through.Like Butler’s, Sunak’s budget marks the beginning of an end to an era. Like his, it signals an accommodation with the expanded role of government, and suggests a significant change of ideological direction for the Tory party. The 2020 budget may redraw the terms of British party politics more significantly than any budget in a generation. It is an immense intellectual and political challenge to the post-Corbyn Labour party.During his speech, Sunak turned to his predecessor, Sajid Javid, sitting on the backbenches. This budget, said Sunak, will get the job done on Javid’s support for further education. It was a curiously restrained and specific piece of homage – and with good reason. Javid would not have delivered most of this budget. He is more of an apostle of austerity than Sunak, more of a small-state man. Sunak has delivered the bigger-state, fiscally unshackled budget that Boris Johnson demanded in the wake of the 2019 election, and that Javid would have struggled with. We saw on Wednesday the real underlying reason why Javid was forced out last month.Until this week, it had seemed as though events might conspire to blunt the change of direction that Sunak announced. And the budget was certainly dominated by the health emergency. The first third of Sunak’s speech dealt with little else. He pledged £30bn upfront on the NHS and on measures to protect businesses and workers. What a contrast a century makes. Anticipating an epidemic-dominated budget, I dug back into Hansard this week to read Neville Chamberlain’s 1919 budget speech, given at the height of the Spanish flu epidemic that killed nearly 230,000 Britons. Influenza got one extremely oblique mention. There wasn’t even a health minister then, never mind a health service. It was another country.Yet while the coronavirus measures will grab the headlines, it’s the investment in infrastructure that marks this budget as different from those that went before. An extra £175bn over five years, claimed as the biggest fiscal boost in 30 years, is serious new money. Significantly both Javid, in a Times interview, and Philip Hammond, in a Today programme interview, had lobbied publicly for fiscal caution in the run-up to the budget. Both former chancellors were ignored by Sunak. Javid’s fiscal rules will be formally “reviewed” over the next six months. The reality is that the rules are dead. The Treasury green book, basis for the calculation of previous public spending, is to be reviewed too. Austerity as a way of economic life is over.Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to pretend that the Johnson Tory party is somehow finding its way back to the political tradition embodied by Butler, who gave his name – along with Labour’s Hugh Gaitskell – to a centrist Keynesian era in British public policy in the 1950s and 1960s. Times have changed. Politicians, let alone different generations of politicians, never step into the same river twice. Thatcher’s counter-revolution against Butskellism changed the game for ever.Yet this feels, even so, to be a significant turn of the tiller in the Tory party’s slow and uncertain journey away from Thatcherism. Thatcher successfully banished the Butler consensus towards tax-and-spend and the role of the state in economic and social policy. David Cameron continued much of the economic thinking of Thatcher but jettisoned most of her social illiberalism. Theresa May hinted at a more social market approach to economic policy but was unable to deliver it. Johnson has now carried his own social market instincts into action.Yet he has no more converted the Tory party en masse to a pristine and coherent new form of social market economic thinking than Thatcher instantly succeeded in converting it to her ideology of possessive inidualism. Part of Johnson’s problem here is that he himself remains uncertain about what, other than his own success, he really believes in.The Tory party itself also remains a very variegated organism. It has fractures between the primacy of economic interests and those of nationalism, between nostalgia and future focus, between government activism and anti-state inidualism, and between conservatism and liberalism, as well as over post-Brexit Britain’s place in Europe and the world. Its leader is a mix of much of the above.But Johnson is moving the Tory party back on to the territory of government activism nonetheless. It is now lazier than ever to dismiss the Tories as mere neoliberals, compulsive austerians or even as the same old, same old – a big challenge for Labour. Something new is emerging in the Tory party. This important budget is proof that it has the upper hand. Call it, perhaps, Johnsonism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3290d86ef01455716efc72a3f7046b426372851d/0_462_2191_1314/master/2191.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22bbd5ebc80cfa3a665d64f884915057","title":"britain containing covid 19 countries hong kong singapore","story":"Are we doing Covid-19 right? With the number of new reported cases of infection declining rapidly in China, but soaring in what is now a semi-locked-down Italy, it’s worth looking at the experiences and strategies of countries to see what can be learned. Governments are faced with stark choices, says Roy Anderson of Imperial College in London, one of the UK’s most eminent epidemiologists. There are essentially four options. You could try to minimise the number of fatalities or the economic impact. You could attempt to flatten the peaked curve in the incidence so that the cases are not all concentrated in a narrow time , which could overwhelm healthcare resources (already severely stretched in the UK). Or you could try to delay the spread in order to buy time for development of a vaccine – although most experts don’t expect one to be available for at least a year.The politicians and policymakers want a strategy to achieve all four, says Anderson – but that’s not possible. In particular, the first two crucial goals – reducing the mortality rate and economic impact – are incompatible. There are “difficult decisions ahead for governments”, Anderson and colleagues wrote in the Lancet last week.China’s draconian approach – essentially bringing normal life to a standstill in affected cities and regions – paid off, says Anderson. But whether that would be possible in western democracies is another matter. Italy’s strategy – which is now to close all schools and universities, impose travel restrictions and prohibit large public gatherings – could work, but it doesn’t seem to have the rigour of the Chinese model: flights are still coming and going in Milan, and the trains are running.The truth, Anderson adds, is that we just don’t know what the best strategy is. There are too many unknowns for mathematical models and predictions to be reliable. “It’s more suck it and see,” he says.In part, this is because we don’t have enough information about the biology of the virus. One crucial factor is the degree of infectiousness: how many people, on average, will catch the virus from an infected inidual. The coronavirus Covid-19 is more contagious than influenza: every person who gets coronavirus will typically pass it on to 2.5 people (at least in the early stages of an epidemic), compared to an infection rate of around 1.3 for ordinary flu.A big unknown is how readily children – who seem to contract only mild symptoms – can pass on the infection. No child seems yet to have been at the start of a chain of transmission, although that doesn’t negate the possible benefits of closing schools. “You don’t take chances with children,” Bruce Aylward, an epidemiologist and assistant director general of the World Health Organization, who observed the Chinese response in Wuhan in February, told the New York Times.The problem is worsened by the fact that people who have the virus may start to feel ill only after they have already been infectious for a day or two, whereas people with Sars were hardly infectious at all before they felt ill. And people with coronavirus remain infectious for a relatively long time, perhaps around seven days, whereas this period was just a few days for the H1N1 swine flu that led to a pandemic in 2009. What’s more, we don’t know how many infected people are virtually free of symptoms.The only way to know that, says Anderson, is with intensive testing of a large random sample of the population, looking not for evidence of a live virus but for antibodies in the bloodstream that signify they have at some point been infected. Such studies are now being done in China, but there are no results yet.The key objective is clear enough: to reduce the period from the first appearance of symptoms to the isolation of the inidual.“China got it down to two days,” says Anderson. “That’s what you need to aim for.” The Chinese were also good at tracing people contacted by infected iniduals, and testing them. That’s a labour-intensive task, and Anderson thinks such efforts are probably understaffed here. “The critical thing is to have very strong surveillance systems that will give you early warning of infection,” says Anne Johnson, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London. And then to “achieve rapid contact tracing and testing, and rapid isolation”.Anderson thinks the trajectory of the outbreak may depend not so much on how governments respond but on how we all do as iniduals. For example, most clusters of infection occur in families, so quick self-isolation from relatives can be crucial. So you should know the most common symptoms – fever and dry cough – and observe basic hygiene: hand-washing, wearing masks, not shaking hands (still my instinctive gesture when I met Anderson, which he politely reminded me to avoid). It’s about maintaining “high levels of respiratory hygiene”, says Johnson, and “really cutting down the numbers of contacts you have.” “We are all in this together,” Johnson says, a point that couldn’t be more apparent from the news that the health minister Nadine Dorries has tested positive for the virus.But some of these measures come at a cost. “All along the line we’re going to have to balance the biomedical impact against the social impact,” says Johnson. It may mostly affect those who are the most needy, she says, such as older people.Anderson thinks the places to learn from are not so much China or Italy but Hong Kong and Singapore. Both are, of course, very crowded places, yet they have kept case numbers in the hundreds. How? “The population reacted very differently to Europeans,” says Anderson. “They had seen Sars” in 2007, and so knew what was needed. They stopped going to restaurants and public events they wore face masks.To bring about such changes in behaviour here, Anderson says, requires clear and responsible public information. We can assume this excludes floating the “theory” that it could be best just to “take it on the chin” and let the infection move through the population, as Boris Johnson suggested on breakfast television.Information should be targeted in particular at the most vulnerable groups – the over-50s – and should make use of social media, and it’s important to get the tabloid press on board to communicate accurate information. So: an information campaign that leverages the power of Facebook and other social media, as well as the tabloids, to deliver information tailored to the inidual. Aren’t these the kind of skills the government has boasted of? Let’s hope they can put them to good use."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fa3cc382d1697dfe68d491328203079c5b726c3/0_266_4144_2486/master/4144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74bc4f4120b1f115151f878ce2b61426","title":"polar ice caps melting six times faster than in 1990s","story":"Losses of ice from Greenland and Antarctica are tracking the worst-case climate scenario, scientists warnThe polar ice caps are melting six times faster than in the 1990s, according to the most complete analysis to date.The ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica is tracking the worst-case climate warming scenario set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists say. Without rapid cuts to carbon emissions the analysis indicates there could be a rise in sea levels that would leave 400 million people exposed to coastal flooding each year by the end of the century.Rising sea levels are the one of the most damaging long-term impacts of the climate crisis, and the contribution of Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating. The new analysis updates and combines recent studies of the ice masses and predicts that 2019 will prove to have been a record-breaking year when the most recent data is processed.The previous peak year for Greenland and Antarctic ice melting was 2010, after a natural climate cycle led to a run of very hot summers. But the Arctic heatwave of 2019 means it is nearly certain that more ice was lost last year.The IPCC’s most recent mid-range prediction for global sea level rise in 2100 is 53cm. But the new analysis suggests that if current trends continue the oceans will rise by an additional 17cm.“Every centimetre of sea level rise leads to coastal flooding and coastal erosion, disrupting people’s lives around the planet,” said Prof Andrew Shepherd, of the University of Leeds. He said the extra 17cm would mean the number of exposed to coastal flooding each year rising from 360 million to 400 million. “These are not unlikely events with small impacts,” he said. “They are already under way and will be devastating for coastal communities.”Erik Ivins, of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in California, who led the assessment with Shepherd, said the lost ice was a clear sign of global heating. “The satellite measurements provide prima facie, rather irrefutable, evidence,” he said.Almost all the ice loss from Antarctica and half of that from Greenland arose from warming oceans melting the glaciers that flow from the ice caps. This causes glacial flow to speed up, dumping more icebergs into the ocean. The remainder of Greenland’s ice losses are caused by hotter air temperatures that melt the surface of the ice sheet.The combined analysis was carried out by a team of 89 scientists from 50 international organisations, who combined the findings of 26 ice surveys. It included data from 11 satellite missions that tracked the ice sheets’ changing volume, speed of flow and mass.About a third of the total sea level rise now comes from Greenland and Antarctic ice loss. Just under half comes from the thermal expansion of warming ocean water and a fifth from other smaller glaciers. But the latter sources are not accelerating, unlike in Greenland and Antarctica.Shepherd said the ice caps had been slow to respond to human-caused global heating. Greenland and especially Antarctica were quite stable at the start of the 1990s despite decades of a warming climate.The IPCC is in the process of producing a new global climate report and its lead author, Prof Guðfinna Aðalgeirsdóttir, of the University of Iceland, said: “The reconciled estimate of Greenland and Antarctic ice loss is timely.”She said she also saw increased losses from Iceland’s ice caps last year. “Summer 2019 was very warm in this region.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7863867c40c8715a756d7fbd08c8e33bc5ac6ffb/0_135_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=200e4db6a1c4b4a5d429b0e99b49ca7c","title":"yas kweens the political importance of being fabulous","story":"From Cheer to Christopher John Rogers, the term has come to define survival in the face of white privilegeIn the first episode of Pose – the hit drama about the 80s ballroom drag scene that gave birth to vogueing – a group from the House of Abundance break into a museum exhibition of Elizabethan-era clothes. They strip the mannequins, stuff the corsets and ruffs into shiny black bin bags, then escape through a smashed window to the ball competition. “The category is Bring it like Royalty,” says the MC, Billy Porter as the gang walk and pose in their Renaissance era garments. They win the competition, but their victory is about not only looking great whatever the cost, but also about breaking with convention, law and history.In Cheer, Netflix’s docudrama about a competitive cheerleading squad, the breakout stars are Jerry Harris and La’Darius Marshall. Unapologetically exuberant, the black, gay teenagers in Republican-supporting, gun-toting Navarro, Texas, should stick out like sore, if deeply fabulous, thumbs. Yet Cheer becomes a story of how they survived grief (the premature death of Jerry’s mum and La’Darius’s suicide attempt) and accepted themselves. In both shows, as black and Latino members of the LGBTQI community, these characters are outside mainstream society and so have created their own. In this world “being fabulous” is not just the defining quality, but acts as a challenge to the status quo and (white, entitled, birthright) privilege.The concept of fabulousness is said to have begun in the drag subculture and with Crystal LaBeija, who is seen as the founder of ballroom’s “house” culture (alternative families for members of the LGBTQI community who have been kicked out of their homes). Pepper LaBeija, from Crystal’s house, was featured in Jennie Livingston’s 1990 documentary Paris Is Burning which brought ballroom culture to a wider audience.It was in this film that many first heard the words that make up the lexicon of fabulousness. Words such as “work!”, “fierce”, “gagging”, “yaaaaas”, “slay” and phrases such as “giving me life” and “serving a look”. Although TV shows such as Absolutely Fabulous, Sex and the City and America’s Next Top Model brought these phrases and concepts into people’s homes, it was RuPaul’s Drag Race (now in its 12th season) that truly bought the concept of fabulousness into the mainstream.Jinkx Monsoon, who won the fifth season of Drag Race, says both drag and fabulousness are about creating your own destiny. “We’re born into this world, and told from day one who we’re supposed to be,” she says. “We’re told at a very early age that we’re expected to behave, dress, and think certain ways – all because of what is between our legs. Drag is casting all of that off, and deciding for yourself who you want to be.”But the concept of “fabulousness” is also, says Madison Moore, the author of Fabulous: The Rise of the Beautiful Eccentric, a lifeline for people who belong to more than one disempowered or persecuted social group and therefore face intersecting prejudices. “Fabulousness is about the risk of stretching out and expanding when you have been told you don’t deserve to exist.”In his book, Moore sets out four traits that define fabulousness: firstly, it does not take a lot of money secondly it requires a high level of creativity thirdly it is dangerous, political, confrontational, risky and largely (but not exclusively) practised by queer or  transgender people of colour and other marginalised groups. Finally it is about “making a spectacle of yourself because your body is constantly suppressed and undervalued”.Because of this, fabulousness is not to be confused with being camp – because it is inherently political. Susan Sontag in her influential 1964 essay Notes on Camp (the inspiration for the theme of the 2019 Met Gala), defined camp as an aesthetic sensibility devoid of any deeper meaning. But Moore points out that for marginalised people, “there’s no such thing as style for style’s sake. Fabulous people are taking the risk of embracing spectacle when it may perhaps be easier, though no less toxic, to normalise. This is very different from how camp is typically discussed.”In 2020, the concept of “fabulousness” is everywhere: in Lil Nas X’s mashing up of neon disco colours with cowboy style or each time Pose’s Billy Porter wears a traditionally non-masculine outfit on the red carpet. Both style statements challenge the white, cis-gendered status quo.Yet, while mainstream culture has absorbed elements of black culture, such as the adoption of the fabulous lexicon into everyday conversation (“yassss kween”) the outsider status has not disappeared. “Being a black body, a black queer body, a black trans body, a gender nonconforming black body in public space is always vulnerable,” says Moore. “You can’t go shopping while black. You can’t go swimming while black. You can’t enter your dorm room while black. You can’t exist in your own home while black. You can’t drive in your car with a white girl while black. You can’t buy designer clothes while black. You can’t wear a hoodie while black. The list continues.”The models stopped dramatically at the end of the runway pausing for the endless clicks of photographers. They strutted in a knowing parody of fashion cliches. “Our shows are filled with a ton of emotion and energy so we encourage the models to feel themselves and the fantasy when they get on the runway,” Rogers tells me after the show. “It’s really about their personal attitudes and moods coming through.”For the designer, his shows are an expression of “encouraging people to take up space and be the most themselves.” Does he think it is important to express fabulousness in the current climate of political isiveness? “Absolutely,” he says “There’s so much vitriol and pessimism in the air towards iniduals who don’t fit certain moulds, so it’s nice to combat that with true expressions of self, in whatever form that takes. The most effective, in some instances, is radical, boisterous personal style.”Pat Boguslawski, the movement coach who choreographed the model Leon Dame’s strutting, angular walk, which went viral at the SS20 Maison Margiela show, says he was inspired to bring iniduality back to the runway. “A fashion show is not just about mannequins and watching the clothes, it’s about creating a show. So we hire dancers, have amazing lighting and great music. I think a fashion show should be a show.” For him, Dame’s walk was an expression of his iniduality. “As a movement director I’m creating something based on (a person’s) character, on who they are.”Being “who they are” is a key narrative element of Pose. Angelica Ross, who played the spiky Candy, says the show is important on multiple levels. “To quote (Pose producer and trans activist) Janet Mock: ‘We have to say these things cause no one else will.’ Pose told a story that no one else wanted to tell as evident by the many ‘nos’ that (creator) Steven Canals received when initially pitching the project. It’s not only important that Pose told our stories, but told them right by including folks from the (LGBTQI) community at all levels of production.”Fabulousness is a much needed state of mind in the current climate. As Ross says: “Being fabulous means feeling free to be yourself. It’s not fabulous if it’s fake.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bf2fe58e18fecf1940af2607e101baf23f1dfc2/0_0_6056_3633/master/6056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef57ff6aa28d1b2951ded2f268435006","title":"i wear my grandads old boxers meet the people who havent bought clothes for a decade","story":"More and more of us are giving up fast fashion. But could you go for 10 years without shopping?  readers tell us how – and why – they haveWhen the former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq told the hosts of Loose Women that she had not bought any clothes in a decade, she was met with consternation and shock from the show’s famously forthright panellists. “You’re not still wearing Blue Peter clothes!” exclaimed Janet Street-Porter. Huq acknowledged, sheepishly, that the lilac cardigan she was wearing did in fact date from her days on children’s TV.Huq’s no-clothes purchasing policy made headlines across the UK. But away from media scrutiny and bemused TV hosts, many ordinary people have been quietly wearing the same clothes day-in, day-out, for the past decade, too. We spoke with  readers who never buy clothes, to ask them how they stay presentable, stop things from wearing out and where they would be if their loved ones didn’t buy them socks come Christmas.I used to care about clothes when I was younger. But then I went to university to study product design and I realised that consumer culture really didn’t sit well with me. We were being trained to design want and need in people. It didn’t feel right.The majority of my clothes are well over a decade old. Some of them do look a bit tatty, I’m not going to lie. I do understand that your first appearance counts for something in society, and that people might look at my clothes and think about me in a certain way. But for me personally, it is more important to be true to what I believe in than care about what other people might think.I last bought a Paul Smith jumper about nine or 10 years ago. It was £140, which is a lot of money, but I still wear it today, and it looks the same as the day I bought it. The most loved item in my wardrobe is a pair of David Beckham-endorsed Adidas shorts I bought when I was 14. I still wear them all the time. The elastic is gone, so I do have to be careful to make sure the drawstring is tied up! They have started to peel a bit.My mum and dad are always trying to buy me new clothes. They are Thatcher’s children: materialism was drilled into that generation buying stuff empowers them. My mum recently insisted on buying me a coat, but only because she was so fed up with the old Barbour jacket I had been wearing.It was my grandad’s Barbour: he has sadly passed away, so I took it from his house after he died. That’s not the only thing I took, actually I wear my grandad’s old Slazenger boxers. My girlfriend thinks it is really weird.I loved that Barbour jacket. It was ancient I kept sending it to the Barbour shop to get it repaired, but they repaired it so many times it was basically a new coat.I never get bored of my clothes. I think that people are told that they need to buy new clothes to fit in and seem trendy, but it is only you who inherently cares what you look like. People are too immersed in their own lives to notice you only have four T-shirts. That stuff doesn’t matter. We have become so selfish as human beings. We are bred to consume. Nothing has any value any more.I am of Asian heritage: my family is from India and Pakistan. I think that’s why I am really reluctant to buy clothes. It is horrible for me to know that people of my heritage are being abused by the garment industry to produce clothes for people in the west who don’t care about their wellbeing.I remember watching the footage of the 2012 Dhaka garment factory fire. It was horrific, watching people try to escape. I don’t like to stand on a soapbox and say: “You should do this, and you should do that.” But for me personally, buying clothes isn’t something I want to do. It’s how I am.Apart from tights and the odd bit of underwear, I haven’t bought any clothes for a decade. I make all of my clothes, myself, by hand. I learned to sew from my mum. She was always immaculate she never had a hair out of place. Just the sweetest, most caring person. She died recently. When I am sewing, I feel close to her. She really knew how to sew.Virtually all the fabric I use is vintage. Buying new fabric is really the same as buying fast fashion, in my book. Why do we need new fabric? There’s already so much beautiful fabric in the world. I work with a charity called Tools for Self Reliance, and they get donated lots of old material. If I see something I like the look of, I pop a donation in the collection box. I also have reams and reams of fabric that I purchased in the 1980s from a dressmaking shop: it was closing down, and the owner let me have it cheap.Most of the time, I am a bit of a scruff. But when I am teaching dressmaking, I make an effort. You want to look nice, because you’re an advert for the clothes you are teaching people to make. I follow trends on social media, and then teach people how to make the clothes at my workshops. You get all sorts: doctors, solicitors, care workers. They all say it is therapeutic.I don’t get bored of my wardrobe, because if I want something new I can just nip upstairs to my sewing room and make it. I can make a shift dress in half an hour I call them my half-hour dresses. I just made a ball gown from old fabric over a few days.I never want to buy things. I look at things in shops and think the quality is abysmal. My daughter makes her own clothes now. I am so glad she is not spending her pennies in those dreadful shops. But I really don’t want to sound like I’m on my high horse. I just want to educate people.Everything in my wardrobe is certainly not from this century. I have had the same ties since the 1980s. I think the last time I bought clothes was in 1984: I was on a business trip and they lost my suitcase, so I went to a shop in Rome and bought new suits, shirts, trousers and underwear.Technically, I could buy clothes. I know where Marks \u0026amp Spencer is! I just prefer not to go shopping. Ever since Woolworths closed, I can’t think of a decent shop. Shopping is so tedious. I can do a supermarket shop, because I have to, otherwise I would starve. But that’s it.I do occasionally get marched to TK Maxx by some lady friends who buy things for me. Whatever they choose is fine. Everything else in my wardrobe seems to arrive! My brother-in-law gives me shirts and pullovers. It’s usually when people think I am looking mucky that stuff tends to turn up. I never ask for anything new. Hand-me-downs look new to me! I can’t tell the difference.I look like a mess, but I don’t really care. It is the same with haircuts: I only get them if I have got to meet the bank manager or something like that. The only thing I buy for myself is socks and pants.I have a woman who comes to clean my house for me and she’s not averse to throwing clothes and shoes away that she deems unwearable. I don’t mind as long as she tells me what she’s chucking out, otherwise I spend ages looking for it and can’t find it. She thinks shirts should have all the buttons on them and rubbish like that. They don’t really. As long as there are some buttons, it will work.Thirty-four years ago, I was pregnant with my daughter back home in Greece. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened and pregnant women were advised not to eat any fresh food. That experience really changed my thinking about the environment.I moved to the UK and studied environmental science, before becoming an accountant. But my interest in the environment and how we consume clothes never went away. Back in Greece when I was growing up, everything was about consumerism. Being a Greek woman who never went shopping, people thought I was crazy!I think I have bought one pair of jeans in the past 10 years. That’s it. My wardrobe is basically empty. It is easy to find everything in there. When I need clothes for a special occasion, like a wedding, I either borrow something from a friend, or there are platforms now where you can rent clothes.It helps that I am the same dress size I was when I was 20. I try to keep fit and not gain weight. Everything in my wardrobe still fits. All my clothes are very good quality: I have a coat that I have worn for 24 years. I take excellent care of it and it’s still in good condition. If you looked at it, you wouldn’t believe I’d had it for so long.Part of the reason my clothes last is because I don’t over-wash them. I have a rule that I wear everything at least twice – underwear excluded, obviously – before washing it. I can wear jeans five or six times before putting them in the machine. I mend all my clothes. If I need a new sweater, I knit something. My friends will often give me wool or yarn. Knitting helps me relax.Never buying clothes feels liberating. I love not having to think about clothes all the time. I have a few things in my wardrobe. Everything goes together. I never worry about what I am going to wear. For me, it has always been simple.I have a bit of a phobia about new clothes. It is about comfort I’m very particular about things. I hate clothes that are too clingy or tight. Animal fibres make me really itchy. I think maybe I am a bit allergic to wool.I like to wear old clothes, because I know they will be comfortable. I don’t like the texture of new clothes at all. It is a bit of a paradox, because in order for things to get old you have got to wear them a lot. If I had the choice between wearing an old item or something new, I’d always go for the old thing.My wife likes to sneak a few new things in my wardrobe from time to time, so I am better presented. She is into fashion and is always beautifully dressed. But the new things tend to stay in my wardrobe. I don’t wear them. Probably three-quarters of the things she buys me, I never wear.We’re at a bit of an impasse, my wife and I. She hasn’t stopped trying to smarten me up a bit and get me into some newer things, but I don’t find those things comfortable. It is a long-running battle, but we have a laugh about it. Sometimes she will drag me into a clothing store, and within 30 seconds I want to walk out.I am not bothered about my appearance or anything like that. Clothes for me are about comfort. Occasionally I will look at other men and think: “That jumper looks nice. I wish I had something like it.” But then I think that, even if I did have it, I would never wear it.Additional reporting by Laura Kay"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df98f98a300268e64ea6b71986ce49949a19cc5/0_1270_6805_4084/master/6805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaee3443d6b693b4d79639cb65ee0f75","title":"how to cook the perfect boxty recipe felicity cloake","story":"Boxty is a versatile potato cake of Irish origin, a sort of cross between a pancake and a flatbread that’s served with anything from fry-ups to fruit – but what’s the best way to make them?These potato cakes, known in Irish as bacstaí (derived from either bácús, meaning bakery, or arán bocht tí, or bread of the poorhouse – no one seems quite sure), are particularly popular in the north-west of the country, where they take a variety of forms, from griddled pancakes to baked wedges of bread.But, like many such humble staples, I reckon they’re best served simply, paired with smoked fish or sausages perhaps, or as part of a carbilicious fry-up. They’ve even inspired poetry, of a sort: “Boxty on the griddle, boxty in the pan if you can’t make boxty, you’ll never get a man” – though, frankly, I wouldn’t be in rush to share mine with anyone, let alone someone too lazy to make their own.As with many traditional recipes from these islands, from Irish stew to cullen skink, boxty should be made with floury, sometimes known as mealy, potatoes – the sort that explode into billowing clouds of mash, rather than melt obediently into silky-smooth pommes puree. Waxy potatoes retain their shape and their texture too well, and turn this into something more like a rösti starchier kinds give a lighter, fluffier result.Kerrs pink and golden wonder are ideal, though the more widely available Roosters will also work well, and even all-rounders such as maris piper, desiree and king edward will be fine just avoid anything sold as a salad potato.Darina Allen, who in her book Irish Traditional Cooking includes a recipe given to her by one Granny Toye of Clones, Co. Monaghan, which instructs readers to squeeze the water out of the potatoes before use, and let it sit for 20 minutes until the starch sinks to the bottom. This can then be stirred back into the dry potatoes as a binder, and the liquid discarded, making her boxty the crispest of them all.(The much-loved domestic science textbook All in the Cooking, first published in 1946, calls for cooked potatoes alone, though it is labelled as “potato cakes” rather than boxty specifically. Nevetheless, I give it a try, and can confirm that fried potato is delicious in all forms, especially when a lot of butter is also involved.)Cooked potato gives the boxty a smoother, softer texture, helping to glue the strands together so you need less flour. That said, it does rely on having some to hand – a good thing if there’s a box of leftover mash reproaching you from the fridge (Skehan observes you can also use leftover colcannon, or presumably champ), but you can make very nice boxty without, too.Toyes’ recipe is the only one not to involve any extra fat, apart from that in which the boxty are cooked. All in the Cooking adds melted butter, or margarine Henry uses tangy buttermilk, and Rachel Allen and McKenna eggs. The latter also loosens her batter with milk the former single cream, explaining: “This is my husband Isaac’s take on boxty – he uses cream and not too much flour so they’re good and rich”.They are indeed – in fact, both Rachel Allen and McKenna’s recipes are almost halfway to Spanish omelettes: pieces of potato suspended in a kind of custard, and lovely they are, too. I’m taken by the simple approach of Granny Toyes, however fewer ingredients make for an intensely potatoey flavour. Call me decadent, but I can’t resist adding a splash of Henry’s buttermilk – the creamy acidity works so well with potatoes, though if you don’t have it, don’t worry.Toyes uses a bare handful of flour – just enough to stick the potato strands together – while Luard’s flour-heavy formula produces something more like a true bread (a good way to stretch potatoes a little further, if necessary).McKenna and Henry both add raising agents, but with so little flour in my recipe, I don’t think that will make much difference.Luard is the only one to bake her boxty, producing a pleasingly chewy, moist flat loaf with a distinct potato flavour. Everyone else fries them on a griddle butter is better than oil for flavour, though good lard or dripping would also be delicious if such things happen to be available.Wash the potatoes, coarsely grate them into a clean tea towel or muslin, then wring out as much liquid as possible into a bowl (a glass one will make life easier). Leave this to sit undisturbed for about 20 minutes, and in the meantime spread out the potatoes to dry.Carefully pour off the liquid from the bowl, retaining the white, starchy powder that’s collected on the bottom, then add the potatoes, salt and buttermilk to the bowl. Stir in enough flour that the potatoes stick together in loose clumps (you may not need it all).Heat the butter in a heavy-based frying pan about 20cm in diameter over a medium heat. When foaming, add the potato mixture and pat it down to fill the pan. Turn the heat down low and cook for about 15 minutes.Gently loosen the edges of the boxty, flip it on to a plate or board, then slide it back into the pan cooked side up, adding a little more butter first if the pan looks dry. Cook for another 15 minutes, until golden on both sides. Cut into quarters to serve.• Boxty, potato farls or tattie scones: what’s your favourite sort of potato bread, and how do you like to eat it?

Liverpool knew it was a possibility, however much they controlled this Champions League tie, however much they dominated in terms of possession and chances. While the margins remained slim, it could happen.It almost came at the end of normal time when Trent Alexander-Arnold conceded a needless free-kick and the unmarked Saúl Ñíguez headed Renan Lodi’s delivery past Adrián. The Atlético celebrations ignited like a firecracker only to fade upon the sight of an offside flag against Saúl.Liverpool ought to have won this game several times over. They attacked in waves, battering Atlético, testing their resilience to the limit. The most influential player on the pitch was the visiting goalkeeper, Jan Oblak, who made a string of excellent saves. Diego Simeone, the Atlético manager, said afterwards that “Barcelona have Messi but we have Oblak”. Liverpool also blew fistfuls of chances, none more gilt-edged than the 67th-minute header that Andy Robertson crashed against the crossbar when gloriously placed.Klopp’s team had led on the night through Gini Wijnaldum’s header on 43 minutes and, early in the extra period, they finally got the goal that put them in front on aggregate. Wijnaldum was the creator, powering up the right flank to cross for Roberto Firmino, whose header hit the inside of the post. When the ball rebounded to him, he steered it into the other corner.Job done? Not at all. The sucker punch came when Adrián accepted a back-pass from Alexander-Arnold and shanked his clearance low and straight to João Felix, who moved it to the substitute Marcos Llorente. The midfielder, who joined last summer from Real Madrid, is not noted for his goalscoring prowess but nobody would have known it. He took one touch to set himself before banging low into the bottom corner. Adrián was extremely slow to get down and across.Llorente was not finished. At the end of the first period of extra time, he took a pass from another substitute, Álvaro Morata, as Atlético broke and, with Liverpool players backing off, he repeated the trick. Touch, shot, goal. Again, Adrián was nowhere near to the shot and it was easy to imagine that Oblak or, more pertinently, Alisson – Liverpool’s injured No 1 – would have done better.Liverpool were broken and Morata rubbed salt into their wounds by running through at the very end to score again. Simeone’s joy knew no bounds. It has been a difficult season for him and his team on the domestic front, with them currently lagging in sixth in La Liga, 13 points behind the leaders, Barcelona. But here, they dug in for a famous win. They found a way.For Liverpool, it added up to a first home defeat in 18 months and a first ever European knockout reverse under Klopp. Most gallingly, they felt their grip loosen on the trophy that they had won last May, when they beat Tottenham at Atlético’s stadium to enable them to add a sixth star to their shirts. They are set to secure a first Premier League trophy since 1990 in the coming days or weeks and, in time, that will feel like the most important detail of a phenomenal season. Here, there was only frustration.In the end, it was comfortable for Atlético but for the overwhelming majority of normal time, this was a siege, with Liverpool working the ball expertly and finding the spaces for first-time crosses. In total they racked up 34 attempts on goal and won 16 corners.Wijnaldum had an early headed sighter and Oblak was extended more and more as the first half wore on. He saved smartly from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sadio Mané while he showed good reactions to beat away an Alexander-Arnold cross that came through a crowd. In between times, Mané saw a header blocked by Lodi. Wijnaldum’s goal came when he held his run by the penalty spot and summoned power and accuracy in his header from Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross. The ball bounced down and seemed to pick up speed off the turf on its way in.Atlético were overrun in the second half and they had Oblak to thank for keeping them alive. His save to tip away a low Oxlade-Chamberlain effort from distance on 54 minutes, having snaked out a long arm, was of the highest order while his presence seemed to spook Firmino at the far post following a whipped Alexander-Arnold delivery.Felipe had glanced wide at the near post following a Koke corner on 18 minutes and Felix worked Adrián on the break during the second half, the Liverpool goalkeeper rather fumbling the save and then ing to reach the loose ball ahead of Ángel Correa. But that was it from Atlético until Llorente drove the stunning turnaround and Klopp would not hide his anger at their defensive approach.Liverpool pressed on, with Robertson blowing his header and also shooting wastefully while Oblak denied Alexander-Arnold, Mané was high with an overhead kick and Salah shot off-target. The script for Liverpool had called for another European comeback, with Klopp having presided over a few of those at this stadium.

The match was played behind closed doors because of coronavirus fears, with many PSG fans congregating outside the Parc des Princes stadium instead.Neymar and Juan Bernat scored before half-time to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit and send the French champions into the last eight for the first time since 2016. Dortmund finished with 10 men after Emre Can was sent off in the dying minutes for a clash with Neymar.PSG made it past the last 16 after painful exits at the same stage in the past two years. They let slip a 4-0 advantage in a 6-5 aggregate defeat by Barcelona in 2017 and lost against Manchester United on away goals after beating the English side 2-0 at Old Trafford 12 months ago.More than 3,000 ultra fans gathered near the Parc des Princes before kick-off after being granted authorisation by the police – demonstrations being considered an exemption to the ban of gatherings of more than 1,000 as French authorities try to contain the coronavirus, which has infected 2,281 people and killed 48.They lit fireworks and their chants could be overheard in the stadium. “Our only virus is Paris SG,” a banner in the empty arena read.PSG were without the captain, Thiago Silva, who had not fully recovered from a hamstring injury, while Kylian Mbappé started on the bench after suffering from a sore throat.PSG dominated possession and had the first clear chance when Edinson Cavani’s cross shot from Ángel Di María’s through ball was deflected by the goalkeeper Roman Bürki.Neymar put the hosts ahead in the 28th minute as he ed in to head home Di María’s free-kick for his 35th goal in 57 matches, making his presence count after missing the return leg against United through injury last season.Bernat doubled the lead on the stroke of half-time by flicking Sarabia’s attempt past Bürki. PSG pressed high after the break while Erling Braut Haaland, who scored a double in the first leg, never looked likely to add to his 10 Champions League goals this season.Thorgan Hazard and Axel Witsel made way for Julian Brandt and Giovanni Reyna as the Dortmund coach Lucien Favre looked to freshen up his attacking line with PSG on the back foot for much of the second half.A brawl erupted two minutes from time after Can fouled Neymar and pushed the Brazilian to the ground. Can was sent off while Di María picked up a yellow card which means the Argentinian will be suspended for the first leg of PSG’s quarter-final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bd16f7c969582cef44f9de51d69d7faa3cff9a1/0_250_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc8a8892fde187607b0a9bde0d3ebf8a","title":"internet not working women girls tim berners lee","story":"Inventor of world wide web calls for urgent action to make cyberspace safer for women and girlsWomen and girls face a “growing crisis” of online harms, with sexual harassment, threatening messages and discrimination making the web an unsafe place to be, Sir Tim Berners-Lee has warned.The inventor of the world wide web said the “dangerous trend” in online abuse was forcing women out of jobs, causing girls to skip school, damaging relationships and silencing female opinions, prompting him to conclude that “the web is not working for women and girls”.“The world has made important progress on gender equality thanks to the unceasing drive of committed champions everywhere,” Berners-Lee wrote in an open letter to mark the web’s 31st birthday on Thursday. “But I am seriously concerned that online harms facing women and girls – especially those of colour, from LGBTQ+ communities and other marginalised groups – threaten that progress.”The warning comes a year after Berners-Lee launched the Contract for the Web, a global action plan to save the web from forces that threaten to drag the world into a “digital dystopia”. Without tackling misogynistic online abuse, the aims of the contract cannot be achieved, he said.“It’s up to all of us to make the web work for everyone,” the letter states. “That requires the attention of all those who shape technology, from CEOs and engineers to academics and public officials.”Berners-Lee highlights three areas that need “urgent” attention. First is the digital ide that keeps more than half of the world’s women offline, largely because it is too expensive, or they do not have access to the equipment or skills to use it.Second is online safety: according to a survey by Berners-Lee’s Web Foundation, more than half of young women have experienced violence online, including sexual harassment, threatening messages and having private images shared without consent. The vast majority believe the problem is getting worse.The third threat comes from badly designed artificial intelligence systems that repeat and exacerbate discrimination. “Many companies are working hard to tackle this discrimination. But unless they dedicate resources and ersify teams to mitigate bias, they risk expanding discrimination at a speed and scale never seen before,” he writes.Amalia Toledo, a lawyer and activist at Fundación Karisma, a Colombia-based group that lobbies for a safer internet, said that women’s rights defenders and female journalists were targeted for abuse more than most.“If they are talking about issues that are pressing in the country, questioning the status quo, or denouncing what the state is doing, they will receive a lot of attacks, and there are more and more coordinated attacks from trolls, attacking their bodies, their families or relationships, and insulting how they look,” said Toledo. “Their opinions are not even discussed.”Fundación Karisma runs an online campaign, “Alerta Machitroll”, which calls out misogynistic attitudes and abuse online. “What victims are told all the time is ‘Oh, that’s nothing, ignore it, or close your account. But this has a big impact on people’s lives. They want to control women, they want women to be silent,” Toledo said.Berners-Lee said the coronavirus outbreak showed how urgent it was to take action. As workplaces and schools are forced to close, the web should be a “lifeline” that allows people to keep working and children to be educated.He called on companies and governments to tackle online abuse as a top priority this year. More data needs to be collected and published on women’s experiences online, while products, polices and services should all be designed based on data and feedback from women of all backgrounds, he said.Finally, he urged governments to strengthen laws that hold online abusers to account, and the public to speak up whenever they witnessed abuse online.Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said: “Tech firms are not neutral actors, and their decisions have real-world consequences. But for too long we’ve seen a piecemeal and often insufficient response from platforms that put users in harm’s way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b7657cedd4f9fd9d12d692abcf34d835b3e793e/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae793a0120213fc12d0d8f73fe0ca2ba","title":"leaving babies to cry does no harm study finds","story":"Study says leaving babies to cry may help develop self-control, but many experts disagreeThe debate over whether parents should leave a wailing baby to “cry it out” or rush to their aid has been reignited by research that suggests allowing them to bawl does no harm.Attachment theory suggests parents should dash to calm their infants, and proponents say leaving infants to cry could have knock-on effects including damaging the bond between parent and child and raising the infant’s stress levels.Others, however, argue that picking a baby up reinforces crying, and that parents should leave the child.Now researchers say they have found that leaving infants to cry has no impact on their behavioural development or their attachment to their mother, but may help them develop self-control.Prof Dieter Wolke, the co-author of the study from the University of Warwick, said the findings suggest parents should not worry too much about which approach they take.“We may have made a mountain out of a molehill,” he said.Amy Brown, a professor of child public health at Swansea University who was not involved in the research, said the study should be treated with caution. Few mothers in the study often left their infant to “cry it out” until they reached 18 months, she said, and the study did not consider how long parents left their child or whether they found it helpful.“This doesn’t prove that controlled crying is a beneficial thing,” she said. . Nor does the study “talk about how distressing a lot of mothers find it when their baby cries”.Writing in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, researchers from the University of Warwick report how they followed 178 babies and their mothers in the UK from birth to 18 months.Mothers were asked to fill in questionnaires to report how often they left their baby to “cry it out” at several points in time: shortly after birth and at three months, six months and 18 months. They were also asked how often and for how long their child cried at various point in the day as a newborn and at three months and 18 months.At three and 18 months the team explored how sensitive the mother was towards their infant, using video-recorded interactions between the two, and at 18 months it assessed the children’s behavioural development and attachment to their mother.The team found mothers rarely left their baby to cry as newborns, but the practice became more common as the child grew older, with about two-thirds of mothers allowing the infant to cry sometimes or often by 18 months.That, the researchers add, appears to bring benefits, noting that children left to cry a few times as newborns cried for shorter periods at 18 months.The team say the practice seems does not seem to cause harm. It saw no negative impact on the level of attachment between mother and child, the mothers’ sensitivity or the behavioural development of the child at 18 months, the latter assessed through a combination of techniques including a questionnaire completed by the parent, a psychologist’s report and watching the infant play with its mother.“We neither recommend leaving infant to cry out nor responding immediately,” the authors write. Wolke said the findings suggested parents intuitively know how to best to respond to their infant, and both they and the child adapt over time.He also said the research did not mean parents should just ignore a crying infant, particularly early in life.Crying is “the only way of communication of a baby, for example for feeding, safety and things,” he said. So caregivers “should react to the crying, and automatically we do this.” Letting the baby cry for a few minutes may be helpful though, he added, particularly if it is not feeding time. “Then they can learn how to self-soothe themselves,” he said.The study has limitations, including that it relied on reports of crying rather than direct observation. Nor was it able to unpick whether leaving the child to wail is the cause of shorter subsequent crying periods.Wolke said that because of parents’ strong attitudes on the topic, it would not be possible to carry out a randomised control trial to explore the issue.Dr Charlotte Faircloth, an expert on parenting from University College London, said the “cry it out” issue was hotly debated.The new study “will be reassuring for many parents who have used these kinds of approaches with their babies, but as the study authors suggest, more credit should be given to parents in trusting that they will find an approach that suits them and their families,” she said.Stephen Scott, a professor of child health and behaviour at King’s College, said a number of studies had shown that overindulged children can lack resilience and develop difficulties later in life.He also said the latest findings made sense from an evolutionary point of view. “It is very unlikely that in the jungle when we were in our caves and off hunting, that a child left to cry for a bit would then be damaged by it,” he said. “It just wouldn’t make for a very resilient species, and yet we are incredibly resilient.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea0787af73fe1d5caea8796eedaeaf47733ba45/0_56_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b7fa96a7ab64ba941cbcec1022f9982","title":"applications bbc top job director general close media figures steer clear","story":"Opportunity to succeed Tony Hall as director general seen by some as ‘poisoned chalice’The window to apply to become the next director general of the BBC is closing, with many leading media executives distancing themselves from a role seen by some as a “poisoned chalice” given the potential for clashes with the government.One prominent person who had been linked to the role said there was little point in applying given the risk that, even if successful, they could be replaced within 18 months. “If they appoint someone the government doesn’t like, the government will appoint a new chairman to sack the director general,” they said.Another leading British media executive pointed out that the outgoing director general, Tony Hall, earned £450,000 a year, substantially lower than chief executive pay in the rest of the UK commercial media market. They said taking a pay cut and dealing with the enormous scrutiny and political pressure that comes with running the public broadcaster would not be offset by the potential prestige of saving the BBC at a delicate moment in its history.Applications were due to close on Wednesday. Whoever takes the role later this year will face ever-reducing budgets an imminent negotiation with the government over a new funding settlement a battle to retain audiences that are drifting to commercial rivals such as Netflix ministers demanding the redeployment of resources outside of London ongoing issues regarding unequal gender pay calls from Conservative MPs for programmes that reflect the views of Brexit voters and the fallout of the decision to make most over-75s pay the licence fee. Any past political statements by candidates will also be expected to come under enormous scrutiny. Potential internal candidates for the job include the BBC commercial chief, Tim Davie, and the corporation’s director of content, Charlotte Moore. In a break with tradition, BBC sources suggested that no leading figure from the corporation’s news operation was putting themselves forward for the role. The director general is also editor-in-chief of the news operation and their attitude towards the department will be key at a time when the corporations’ news output has come under enormous scrutiny amid accusations of bias from all sides of the political ide.There will also be substantial pressure to appoint the first female director general, long after many other leading British media organisations have been led by women. This has led speculation to focus on the former Channel 4 chief creative officer Jay Hunt, currently running Apple’s European television operation, and Jane Turton of All3Media, which owns the independent production companies that make hits including Call the Midwife and Fleabag.Other external executives linked to the job have ruled themselves out of the running, with the ITV chief executive, Carolyn McCall, saying it is “not something I’m considering”. Others such as the Channel 4 chief executive, Alex Mahon, and the Glasgow-based STV chief, Simon Pitts, have said they remain committed to their current jobs.One of the few iniduals happy to be linked to the job is the former chancellor George Osborne, with friends of the Evening Standard editor telling the Financial Times he was interested.A particular concern for candidates is the position of the government-appointed BBC chairman, who runs the corporation’s governing board, which ultimately oversees the work of the director general.The current occupant of the role is David Clementi, whose five-year term in office runs until February 2021. Hall’s decision to quit earlier than expected has enabled Clementi to oversee the appointment of the next director general, giving him substantial sway over the broadcaster’s future in the medium term. But it also means that whoever gets the director general job is likely to find themselves working for a new, unknown, government-appointed chairman shortly after being appointed.This raises the prospect of a repeat of previous incidents of government intervention in the workings of the BBC, such as when Margaret Thatcher’s government, concerned about the BBC’s output, appointed Marmaduke Hussey as chairman in 1986. Within months he had sacked the then director general, Alasdair Milne."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de73a78294eb3da92a6931c2aea32787400e66e5/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a57ef7dc331d0faae31f2b292e0c842","title":"tell us are money struggles making you lonely","story":"We want to find out how people are feeling isolated by their financial woesWe may be bad at talking about money but we are arguably even worse at talking about our difficulties managing it.Research by the Money Advice Service found that half of people in debt did not want to talk to friends and family about it because they didn’t want to worry them.Money struggles can lead to people feeling cut off from others for a range of reasons, but withdrawing into financial loneliness can make it even harder to solve your problems.We want to understand more about how people feel isolated as a result of their financial woes.How has your employment status affected your income?

We were looking forward to a joint committee in the UK on the 30th and we were also looking forward to the next stage of negotiations going ahead, but we have had indications today from Belgium there may be specific public health concerns.”It is not clear what the fresh concerns are, but Belgium has confirmed its first death from the virus.Last week two cases of the virus were confirmed by authorities in Brussels, one at the European Defence Agency and another at the Council of the European Union.Gove was answering questions at the first Brexit select committee hearing since the election.He defended the decision not to publish an impact assessment of the EU deal the government is pursuing despite issuing a 60-page assessment last week on the impact a deal with the US would have.As head of the exit operations groups and a member of the cabinet’s exit strategy group and member of the EU-UK joint committee, Gove is one of the most powerful government ministers in relation to Brexit.He was grilled by MPs over checks on goods to Northern Ireland and other key subjects on which the UK and the EU have clashed.He declined to answer questions about the checks mandated by the Northern Ireland protocol, saying: “That will be a matter for the joint committee.”His answer appears to underline what sources say is an agreement by both sides to “deal down the rhetoric” to allow negotiators to get on with the challenging task of getting an outline deal by the June deadline for the “stock taking” review of talks.The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster also confirmed that the UK would produce a legal text of its negotiation position but reserved the right not to publish the text until it saw fit.The EU is also producing a legal text of its position with sources saying that when published the two papers will underline how far apart both sides are on key areas – fisheries, state aid and the level playing field and crime and justice.The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock accused the government of misleading voters during the general election campaign by claiming there was an “oven-ready Brexit” when “in fact it was at the back of the frozen food section” and nowhere near completion.Kinnock put it to Gove that he knew it would be impossible for Britain to get a quota-free and tariff-free deal if it did not accept alignment with the EU on state aid and the level playing field.Gove hit back saying a frozen food version of Brexit would just take “longer for the microwave to ping” and in any case it was possible to get something like the “Marks and Spencer deal you get – a starter, main course and a pudding and you decide which ones you want to get but all for £9.99”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ab7fc37f07ab5b8dae95106096aaf3cad18098/0_22_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52696c8977e66a4ac5495373c2d73911","title":"rishis wholesale spaffing sends tories into raptures","story":"Chancellor promises the world safe in the knowledge he can blame the coronavirus if it all goes wrong Some things are more important than the coronavirus. You’d have thought that once the junior health minister Nadine Dorries had announced she had caught it, some members of the government – Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock among them – might have chosen to self-isolate. For everyone else’s safety as much as their own. Other workplaces have shut down for less.But this was Rishi Sunak’s Big Day Out. A chance for the 16-year-old school prefect doubling as chancellor to splash the cash, to show that the “people’s government” really did care for the lower orders every bit as much as it did for the hedge funds that had bankrolled its election victory.So the entire cabinet squeezed themselves along the front bench to cheer him on. Boris and Matt did their best to look really, really well – “There’s nothing wrong with us, guv” – while Psycho Dominic Raab discreetly coughed into his hands. No one passed him a tissue. Or a face mask. Rather they tried not to look as if they had noticed, while slowly edging themselves away. Keep Calm and Carry On. Ish.Sunak began by announcing £30bn of measures to help the country get through the coronavirus epidemic, a serious amount of cash that rather suggested the government believes the situation is going to be a great deal worse than it has up till now been prepared to let on.Everyone thought it best not to mention the fact that the NHS might be in a far better place if the Tories hadn’t cut public services relentlessly for the past 10 years. The UK has fewer than half the intensive care beds of almost every other EU country. Or that people on zero-hours contracts were still vulnerable. Then we are at a new Year Zero where austerity never happened. The mere mention of George Osborne or Philip Hammond is enough to get you disappeared.A wiser chancellor might have cut his losses after the coronavirus announcements. Just explain we were on the verge of a recession even before we had entered a crisis situation, so there were too many unknowns for any sane economist to make any credible future spending plans. So turn this into an emergency budget, with the promise of a follow-up when he had a clearer picture or what he was dealing with. There again, it might just be handy to have the coronavirus to blame when everything else goes tits up. You win some, you win some.In any case, Rishi had another 45 minutes of Noises Off am-dram theatrics to get through. It’s always the politicians with the least charm and charisma who feel obliged to go on the longest. He waved his arms about, told a couple of shit gags and indulged in a bit of call and response. “We got Brexit done,” he squeaked. “What else are we getting done?” “Absolutely everything,” replied the Tory benches, reading from the Boris hymn sheet.And in a way they were. Boris looked thrilled. Priapic, even. There’s nothing he likes more than wholesale spaffing. After a while even the Tory benches got into the swing of things. If this had been a Labour chancellor announcing the very same measures, the Conservative MPs would have been having a full-on Venezuelan Marxist heart attack, but as it was their boy they collapsed with multiple orgasms.There was no end to Rishi’s rabbits. Literally anything anyone had ever wanted, they could have. Hospitals? As many as you like. Trains, planes and automobiles? Go for it. Schools. Houses. Booze. Toys. Things. Stuff. There wasn’t really a plan for any of this, but there sure was the cash. Not just for infrastructure projects but also for day-to-day spending.Sunak had no idea where any of the money was coming from – it sure as hell wasn’t coming from his own pocket, as he intended to hang on to the fortune he’d made at Goldman Sachs – but the £600 health surcharge on every immigrant was a decent start. The rightwingers in his party would be salivating at the prospect of cracking down on a few foreigners. Who said this wasn’t a budget for everyone? All the chancellor knew was there was unlimited cash for everything. Apart from the things there wasn’t cash for.Just about the only Tory not to enjoy the occasion was Sajid Javid. The former chancellor looked thoroughly miserable throughout. This was Sunak stealing all his best lines. Even the ones about sticking to the fiscal rules with a view to ignoring them at a later date. Rishi was on the up – a possible leader in waiting – while the Saj was going nowhere. Having an unexpected fit of conscience suddenly didn’t look like such a good idea after all. He should have dumped his Spads and taken the glory.As usual, Jeremy Corbyn replied for the opposition. Though he may as well not have bothered. He is already three months past his sell-by date and no one in the Commons pays attention to a word he says. Even Corbyn appears to be bored by Corbyn. He made little effort to engage with anything Sunak had said and just read from his prepared script in a morose monotone.There again, almost no one would care much about the budget by the end of the day. Within hours the World Health Organization had declared the coronavirus to be a global pandemic and that many governments had been too slow to act. The UK being a possible case in point.

The team add that the tracks were found in sedimentary rocks thought to be about 170 million years old, which formed from mudflats that once bordered a lagoon.Stegosaurs – hefty, armoured plant-eaters with upright plates running down their backs and a spiked tail – are a major group of dinosaurs, yet Brusatte noted there are few bones or tracks that date from this time anywhere on Earth.The new study, published in the journal Plos One, follows previous finds by the team, including tracks which revealed that as well as huge, long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs known as sauropods, Skye was once home to meat-eating dinosaurs, probably theropods.As with that study, the newly discovered prints were found at Rubha nam Brathairean, or Brothers’ Point, on the east of the island, albeit at two different sites.In addition to the stegosaurus prints the team found other tracks, with about 50 prints discovered in total.“There are some three-toed prints with claw marks that were made by theropods, but there were no sauropod tracks at these sites,” said Brusatte, noting that tracks of the latter were previously found further into what was once the lagoon, suggesting sauropods splashed through shallow water rather than walking on the mudflats.However, some of the newly discovered three-toed prints were larger than others and had stubby toes which, the team suggests, could have been made by another type of dinosaur – plant-eating, bird-hipped creatures called ornithopods, a group that includes duck-billed dinosaurs. But Brusatte said more evidence was needed.“If we find bones of big ornithopods on Skye I think that will be a pretty good sign that some of these tracks were made by ornithopods,” he said.The team say the new findings expand our understanding of the community of dinosaurs that once roamed the Scottish isle.“It would have been overrun with … so many different types of dinosaurs: meat-eaters, plant eaters, big ones, small ones, ones that were running around, ones that were wading in the water, ones that had long necks, ones that had plates on their backs,” said Brusatte. He added that in the middle Jurassic, Skye was not the chilly, windswept environment we know today – it was closer to the equator. “It was an island in the middle of the ever-widening Atlantic with this subtropical, wet, humid, hot climate with rivers draining mountains in the middle of the island, emptying out into the ocean and then beaches and lagoons fringing the coasts – and these places were havens for dinosaurs and for all kinds of other species,” Brusatte said.The team say the latest finds highlight the importance of re-examining well-known areas, noting that one of the sites has been scrutinised by palaeontologists and geologists for decades yet its secrets remained hidden until a storm shifted some boulders.

The man who has seen his colours carried to victory here more often than any owner in the game added four more winners to his lifetime total on Wednesday and yet may still have left the track mulling over the one that got away. McManus has now won 64 races at the Festival but after the odds-on defeat of Defi Du Seuil in the feature event, the Queen Mother Champion Chase is still not among them.But maybe that just adds to the story. McManus has been a constant thread in the Festival narrative for decades, most famously in his early days thanks to some legendary tilts at the betting ring. Huge gambles were landed, often at the expense of the late bookie Freddie Williams, one of the few layers in the ring willing to take McManus on, while the owner also owned a series of Grade One-winning champions, including Istabraq, who took three Champion Hurdles, and Baracouda, twice successful in the Stayers’ Hurdle. There were three winners for the green-and-gold in one afternoon in 2012, including Synchronised, his only winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup.Never before, though, has McManus had a day like Wednesday, which kicked off with the most dramatic success in his colours since Tony McCoy somehow dragged Wichita Lineman past the post on the opening day in 2009. Champ, a 4-1 chance for the RSA Chase, looked a lost cause between the last two fences and briefly hit 700-1 in-running before arriving with a storming run up the hill to win going away.McManus makes fewer excursions to the betting ring these days. With a rumoured wealth of €2bn from currency trading, it might not have quite the same buzz. But Dame De Compagnie, the winner of the Coral Handicap Hurdle, was noticeably strong in the market in a race where the owner had five starters, and finished as if she could sense it to win by two-and-a-quarter lengths.“I would just like to mention a friend of mine, Joe McKenna,” McManus said as he celebrated his 62nd Festival winner. “He’s not here today, he’s been here with me for the last 30-odd years but he is at home at the minute. Just to say, we are thinking of you, Joe, and we will have you back here next year.” Three races later, McManus’s lifetime total had reached 64, as Easysland saw off Tiger Roll, the dual Grand National winner, in the Cross Country Chase before Aramax squeezed home by a length in the Juvenile Handicap Hurdle.The odds on the McManus four-timer worked out at 1,019-1, even without the one that got away. The script for this year’s Champion Chase seemed to be pre-written as just five runners went to post, with Defi Du Seuil priced at 4-11 after Chacun Pour Soi, his main market rival, joined Altior on the sidelines earlier in the day. A first win for the owner in the one feature race to elude him thus far seemed all but guaranteed.But there are no guarantees at the Festival and Defi Du Seuil was beaten a long way from home, after a lifeless display which Philip Hobbs, his trainer, was at a loss to explain. The only consolation, perhaps, is that after a grand total of 64 winners in green and gold at the biggest meeting of the year, it is good that McManus still has something to aim for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8639fb683cfd79c4fe3816ad5af24d4108b0037/0_0_5130_3078/master/5130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c57f4256c5c6b46986160013d9478e65","title":"two more haas team members tested for covid 19 on eve of australian grand prix","story":"Amid fears that the coronavirus is already spreading in the Formula One paddock at the Australian Grand Prix, the world champion Lewis Hamilton has admitted he is “shocked” the race is going ahead.Up to eight team members have now been tested for the coronavirus and placed into self-isolation as further doubt is cast over the running of the race on Sunday. Hamilton delivered a withering assessment of why he believed the meeting was taking place, commenting that “cash is king”.Hamilton, the six-time world champion goes into the season opener at Albert Park as strong favourite to take a record-equalling seventh title. However he was uncompromising in his condemnation that F1 was putting its personnel and its fans at risk in holding a meeting that is set to attract at least 100,000 people to the circuit on race day just as the WHO has declared a global pandemic.“It’s a concern I think for the people here – it’s quite a big circus that’s come here and it’s definitely concerning for me.”Despite doubts being expressed about whether holding the race was suitable given the global spread of the infection, promoters, the FIA and F1 have insisted there is no reason as yet to cancel the meeting. Race fees are one of the three biggest revenue streams for F1. When asked why he thought it was going ahead Hamilton pointedly noted: “Cash is king. I can’t add much more to it. I don’t feel like I should shy away from my opinion.”Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel insisted that the drivers would act collectively to desist from racing were there to be any fatalities associated with F1 from the coronavirus. “We hope it doesn’t get that far. If it were to get that far, then for sure you would pull the handbrake,” he said.“We share a common opinion on big decisions and that would qualify as a very big decision. Ultimately, as I said before, you look at yourself and I think we would be mature enough to look after yourselves and pull the handbrake in that case.”Two members of the Haas team and one from McLaren, who were identified with fever symptoms on Wednesday, underwent tests for the coronavirus before going into self-isolation. No results have yet been made available.On Thursday morning Guenther Steiner, the team principal of Haas, confirmed that two more members of his team had shown symptoms and undergone a test before leaving the circuit, while the deputy chief health officer of Victoria, Annaliese van Diemen, later said a total of eight people from various teams had now been tested.Steiner expects the results from Wednesday’s tests to be available on Thursday evening but McLaren warned that the results could take anything between 24 and 72 hours to be distributed. An FIA representative explained that Melbourne has only only one facility for testing for the virus, that can only process 500 cases at a time and is currently dealing with a backlog.Van Diemen stated if any were to return positive results, their close contacts would be placed into “immediate quarantine”. This would have a huge impact on the ability of any team to function. Mechanics and engineers all work in close proximity to one another and to drivers. Van Diemen said the test results had been made a priority.She added that if the tests were positive, it would be a matter for the chief health officer and the health minister to decide if the event could go ahead. “It will depend on how many people have tested positive and how many potential contacts they may have exposed in the days running up to their illness,” she said.Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos said she had not received any advice from the chief health officer Dr Brett Sutton to suggest the Formula One season opener should be cancelled. But should the tests return positive, Sutton is prepared to stop the race.At Albert Park on Thursday, the build up to the race continued with the track open to the public. Teams however were taking greater precautions as concern spread that the virus already had a hold in the paddock.Most have cancelled some of their TV media sessions because of the proximity required by cameramen and interviewers and press conferences are taking place behind taped exclusion zones to keep journalists at a distance from drivers and team personnel. The Williams team have closed their hospitality to the media and deputy team principal Claire Williams suggested it would up to to the Australian government to cancel the race if necessary.Steiner said that one engineer and three mechanics from his team had now been tested for the virus. “It is something we need to take seriously and we take it very seriously,” he said. “If somebody has something we ask that they tell us because we want to make sure that they are as safe as possible and not hide it, because that would be the worst thing to do – to spread the virus by not giving attention to it.“The world is in a difficult position at the moment. We think about ourselves here because this is our world, but there are a lot of bigger problems in the health system where people get infected and they need to work day in night.”The FIA and F1 have still yet to respond since the five suspected cases of the coronavirus were reported. Steiner however believed the coronavirus situation had a pace too fast for the governing bodies to anticipate.“This situation is developing so quickly, on an hourly basis that no one can have total control over it,” he said. “I think we are all grown-ups and we need to take care of ourselves. To now say FIA and FOM didn’t give enough leadership, I wouldn’t say that because they didn’t know what was coming. We have been here since Sunday and on Sunday here there was not a problem with the virus and it just escalated.”With the WHO declaring a global pandemic, F1’s chief executive Chase Carey visited Vietnam on Wednesday as the race which is scheduled to take place on 5 April looks increasingly under threat of being cancelled. Carey was not due to visit until after the Australian GP but events have precipitated talks in Hanoi. While he was there the country’s health ministry reported 35 new cases of the virus.On Monday Vietnam suspended visa-free entry to Vietnam from eight European countries, including the UK, Germany, France and Spain. Entry from Italy had already been suspended. The next F1 round in Bahrain is currently still set to take place behind closed doors next weekend.It is also understood that Formula E is shortly set to announce it will formally suspend its season for two months in reaction to the WHO announcement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90eea4dc350634eaf1807c60c6acd0bbe822bca3/0_249_4408_2645/master/4408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e88897b3eeb4dd44c16f434e800bd321","title":"are electric cars cheaper to maintain and four other common ev questions answered","story":"Motoring journalist Jess Shanahan tackles the questions often asked by drivers thinking of going electric – and finds out EVs are efficient to run, easy to charge, and cost-effectiveIf you’re currently in the market for a new car, chances are you’ll have considered, at least briefly, the possibility of going electric.While even five years ago, the thought of owning an electric vehicle (EV) was pretty radical, increased awareness of the climate crisis combined with ever-improving EV technologies – not to mention talk of cost savings – are resulting in more and more people making the switch.But if you still have some pressing questions and niggling doubts, you’re not alone. We’ve taken five of the most common EV questions to the experts to help you make an informed decision ...Are electric cars cheaper and easier to maintain than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars?In short, yes. An electric motor is much more simple than an ICE, with fewer moving parts. As a result, the battery pack and motor need less maintenance than the equivalent parts in an ICE vehicle.“There’s no oil or oil filter to change, no engine to maintain and fewer parts to wear out, so an EV will be cheaper to service,” explains Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “Some drivers also find they drive more economically as the instrument panel indicates how you are driving and shows you, in real time, the energy being consumed by the battery. This can mean drivers are lighter on the accelerator and brakes, therefore extending the life of brakes and tyres too.”Renault has also adopted an energy recovery braking system: every time the vehicle slows down, part of its kinetic energy is converted into electricity. The battery is recharged when the driver lifts the foot off the accelerator or slightly engages the brake. This helps preserve or even increase your driving range, and of course save you electricity charges.How far can electric cars go?This varies from electric car to electric car, but almost all will do more than 100 miles on a full charge, with most newer models going past 200 miles.Even EVs with smaller battery capacities can be charged quickly, though. Using a rapid charger, just 20-30 minutes of charging will give more than enough juice to complete most everyday journeys.Do electric cars pay road tax?Yes and no … depending on the age and price.All EVs registered prior to April 2017 pay zero vehicle excise duty (VED, often called “road tax”), as it’s all based on tailpipe emissions – and as EVs generate 0 gkm of CO2, they’re exempt.However, the rules around VED changed in April 2017, and a premium tax was introduced. Now, any car over £40,000 when new has to pay an annual supplement (£310-320 a year depending on the model year of the vehicle) for the first five years, regardless of its emissions.Fortunately, it’s possible to bag a brand new EV for far less than the £40,000 threshold. For instance, New Renault ZOEs start at £25,670 – no VED is just one of the reasons it’s the ideal first electric car.Are electric cars automatic?Not exactly. Like automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a clutch or gear stick, but that’s where the comparison stops. Unlike automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a gearbox at all, which results in a smoother ride and nippy acceleration.Confused? Rice explains: “ICE cars need gears as they can only generate powertorque in a narrow band of engine speeds and the gears help keep the engine within those bands. In an electric car, maximum torque is available instantly and at low speeds so there is no need to have multiple gears.”Can I charge my electric car at home?Not only can you charge your electric car at home, it’s the preferred option for most EV owners.When it comes to charging at home, you have two options. By far the most efficient is using a dedicated home-charging point – something Renault provides for free with every retail purchase** of the New Renault ZOE. These are wall-mounted, weather-proof units that you connect to your car to using a dedicated charging cable. It’s best to charge your car at night – when electricity rates are often cheaper – and then top up in smaller bursts throughout the day, if needed.The second home-charging option is to charge your car using a normal three-pin socket. This is a great solution if you’re away from home and need a top-up, but shouldn’t be your only, or primary, charging solution. Charging this way is much slower than using a wall-mounted unit, and gives eight miles of range an hour of charging compared with a 7kW home charger that will give around 30 miles of range an hour, according to WLTP testing*. You can also often top up for free on public networks when you are out and about – look for charging points at supermarkets and public car parks. Rapid DC charging at 50kW available on the New Renault ZOE will give an estimated 90 miles driving range in 30 minutes.Curious to learn more about EVs?

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

Snaps of a weekend spent at its newest UK branch, in Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter, were met with heart-eye emojis and “that hotel looks beautiful!” comments. The fact it’s a hostel – with affordable pet-friendly suite rooms (plus dorms), a yoga studio and a South American-style restaurant due to open in the summer – was something I revelled in sharing.It’s in a former Victorian gold and silverworks factory, with the red-brick exterior still featuring the names of previous business. The maze of corridors (with cubby holes for reading) lead to a range of dorms and private rooms. Dusky pink, eggshell blue and emerald green run throughout, with velvet chairs, bold murals, gold fixtures and large plants. The largest room, The Loft, was a winner for my weekend for 2.5 guests (the half being a small dog). There are high ceilings and large windows, and it has a comfy seating area, desk, small kitchen and bathroom. In the lounge-bar downstairs, there are activities including drink-and-draw sessions with Cass Arts. On upper floors (above bedrooms) is a communal kitchen, living-dining area, cinema room and yoga-and-wellness studio.What about breakfast and dinner?The restaurant is due to open in the summer, serving breakfast followed by an all-day menu. Currently, a simple breakfast is included (toast, cereal, juice and hot drinks). The bar serves cocktails, wine and beer all day. If heading out, there are brunch spots towards the city centre. Medicine Bakery and Gallery (15 minutes’ walk) is close to Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and does mammoth plates of sourdough and rye, loaded with eggs – from masala-spiced and huevos rancheros, to scrambled with thick-cut smoked salmon and dill creme fraiche.What’s on the doorstep?Among the 500 or so retailers in the surrounding Jewellery Quarter – as well as the listed Victorian buildings and ghost signs – are local foodie favourites including Otto (wood-fired pizza and homemade limoncello) and 1000 Trades, a pub serving local brews with a new foodie pop-up each month.The Digbeth area’s former factories are now home to venues: including arts centres the Custard Factory and Eastside Projects. Digbeth Dining Club has taken over another space under the railway bridge and is hard to beat for fun after dark. It combines a rotating array of street food stalls, and Mama Roux’s live music and performance venue. Just round the corner is Birmingham’s oldest pub, the black-and-white timber Old Crown, which opened in 1368, and now includes a huge beer garden. How much?Dorms from £15, double from £35, loft suite from £60.• selinaAntonia WilsonWhat’s it like?“Down here is the only part of the building left from the 1600s I tend not to come down after dark,” one of the staff at the Court tells me as we head into a space in the basement.Layers of history are kept intact throughout this former courthouse and jail, most of which dates from the 19th century. Excavation has continued on the lower ground floor, uncovering older rooms and a staircase thought to have been used by judges to escape trouble. The basement is already used for beer tastings every evening and there are plans to open a whisky bar.The listed building has had many original features restored. The vast courtroom, housing the largest mixed-gender 24-pod-bed dorm, still has original panelling and a vaulted ceiling. There are 200 Japanese-style curtained pod beds across several dorms and 12 private rooms (some en suite) in the former cells, with bolted doors and tiny barred windows. Decor is plain, without being clinical: white walls, grey tartan details. Keep eyes peeled for the graffiti by former inmates on the walls of what were once holding cells, now knocked through to form the staircase and the refurbished security gates in some corridors. The common room includes pews from the courthouse, with Scots Law pages as wallpaper.What about breakfast and dinner?Breakfast is included, with a buffet of fruit, yogurt, cereals, batter to use in the waffle-maker, along with ingredients for cheese toasties. No other meals are served but the kitchen is open for guests to use any time. Daily beer tastings cost £5 (six brews to try).What’s on the doorstep?It’s in the Old Town, so there’s plenty nearby. For free live music, Stramash, in a converted church, is popular – showcasing local bands, plus hosting cèilidh and other events. I also visited 12th-century St Giles’ Cathedral as part of the Burns \u0026amp Beyond culture trail, an annual event opening up unusual venues for small gigs. The cathedral is open year round.Holyrood Distillery is nearby and is the first single-malt distillery to open in the city for 100 years. It’s been welcoming visitors since July 2019 and offers tours (from £14) with whisky and gin tastings and games in the interactive aroma room. The first official batch of the single malt will be available in 2023. After all that merriment, a hike up Arthur’s Seat will help shake-off hangovers, followed by lunch round the corner at The Outsider, serving soups, salads and nutritious, seasonal food, or at Civerinos for its 20in stone-baked pizzas (slice from £3.95, pie from £19.75). It’s open until midnight at weekends. For culture, lesser-known galleries and museums in the vicinity include Stills for contemporary photography or gruesome anatomy artefacts at the Surgeons’ Hall Museums.How much?Dorm pod beds from £11 B\u0026ampB, private rooms from £40 B\u0026ampB• codehostels• Rail travel from London provided by thetrainlineAWWhat’s it like?Opened in October 2019 – after a refurbishment of a hostel acquired by the YHA – Newcastle Central is part of the hostelling association’s move into city centres. On the site of a prison, the hostel is in part of the city’s former telephone exchange, built in 1932.The ground floor is mostly taken up with a cafe – where I was checked in. My private room was on the snug side and dominated by a huge flatscreen television but was cosily warm – very welcome since it was freezing outside. There was enough space for a double bed (I slept like a log both nights), a small desk and a couple of wireless phone-charging shelves. Clothes storage amounted to hangers on the wall, and one corner of the room had been sacrificed to a prefab en suite.You don’t come to a hostel to spend time in your room, though. I found it a good space to use as a base and for the rate, it’s exceptional value. There are suites, too, if room to spread out is needed, and traditional dorms if feeling sociable.What about breakfast and dinner?Unlike many YHA hostels, there’s no kitchen for guests to cook their own meals. It is possible to bring cooked food in and staff are happy to supply crockery and cutlery. The hostel does, however, run a funky licensed cafe on the premises. At night, this has a bar feel, with its dimmed lights and industrial exposed-brick-and-girder aesthetic. In one corner, a wall is adorned with photos of the prisoner class of 1873, whose stay on this site was less pleasurable than my own.Breakfast is what you might expect in a hostel: a buffet of cereal, yoghurt (dairy and soya), toast, ham and cheese, and hot drinks and juices. The all-day menu features standard dishes, such as stone-baked pizzas, jacket potatoes, and burgers. However, the light bites section is more adventurous: panko squid strips and mock duck pancakes included! I opted for the Mediterranean vegetable and olive salad, a portion of fries and a non-dairy strawberry and yuzu ice-cream – all very palatable, as was the bill: £13. And should you stay the night and have children under 10 with you, they eat for free.What’s on the doorstep?I came by train, so was pleased to find the hostel an uncomplicated 10-minute walk from the city’s mainline station. It’s a stone’s throw from Grainger Town: stuffed with listed buildings and where most of Newcastle’s shopping, eating and drinking gets done. The area is also home to The Stand Comedy Club and the Theatre Royal. I went for an enriching (and free) self-devised art-and-lit walking tour: the traditional Laing Art Gallery, the contemporary Biscuit Factory (the UK’s largest independent art gallery) – both of which have great cafes – and finally, after a stroll along the River Tyne, the Lit and Phil, a gloriously fusty independent library where you can grab a coffee and read surrounded by 200,000 books.What’s it like?The decline of the British pub is well documented but closures have slowed in the last few years, thanks to local campaigns, communities fighting back – and projects such as PubLove helping reinvigorate the scene. Since 2007, the company has been refurbishing pubs around London, modernising while retaining character, and adding hostel rooms to the underused upper floors.A popular spot on a quiet corner near London Bridge, The Rose \u0026amp Crown on Union Street opened in June 2019. It’s a mixture of modern bunk dorms with block colour walls in emerald green and yellow, and shared bathrooms. There’s also a large modern double en suite in the loft, with weathered wood and white brick walls, geometric print carpet and a huge bathroom. The common room is the buzzy pub itself. It had a great atmosphere on a Thursday night, after an evening mooching around nearby Bermondsey. Interiors in the pub mix traditional elements such as wood panelling, green tiling and a horseshoe bar, with modern touches of exposed brickwork, white walls and velvet chairs. What about breakfast and dinner?Brunch is served 9am-6pm – with options from toast with spreads (£2) to full veggie breakfast (£9) and shakshuka (£10). Noon to 10pm, there are also burgers (from £10) – including vegan ones – and loaded fries (from £5.50). The bar is available 247 for guests.What’s on the doorstep?A 10-minute walk east, Bermondsey has the Beer Mile – a stretch of tap rooms and indie bottle shops under old railway arches. It’s actually closer to two miles, and there are 18 stops to choose from over an afternoon, with Maltby Street market a good starting point for food – from cheesy Venezuelan arepa buns to rich Ethiopian lentil wat.Round the corner, Bermondsey Street’s Victorian terraces are now home to independent restaurants, boutique shops, basement bars, plus the Fashion and Textile Museum is here too. If visiting on a Thursday, speakeasy-style Izakaya, in the basement of ramen cafe Hakata, runs masterclass tasting evenings for free. Hosted by a different drinks supplier each time, it also includes nibbles, such as sticky gochugaru ribs and spicy edamame. Just opposite the hostel, Flat Iron Square street food market, is popular year-round with indoor and outdoor areas, open midday to midnight most days, with live music, DJs, sports screenings and other events. The hostel is also well placed for exploring the South Bank, including Tate Modern, Shakespeare’s Globe and the Shard.How much?Dorms from £13, double en suite from £110.• publoveAWWhat’s it like?As I’m checking in, Andy, at reception, is keen on sharing news of what lies ahead for this already-impressive 96-room hostel on Hatton Garden – less than 10 minutes’ walk from Liverpool Lime Street station. His eagerness is borne of potential (25 more beds will be added by June) and adventure, as he and the Sleep Eat Love team are planning a fact-finding tour of Europe and UK hostels. The mission: to improve what Sleep Eat Love offers. For my part, one improvement would be the signposting, as my choice of stairs over lift means a circuitous route around this labyrinth-like former fire station. Still, that allows for fact-finding of my own as I pass hostel staples, such as a laundry room, lounge, games room and kitchen areas.My private en suite double is spacious and wants for nothing, save for a television, though I don’t see that omission as onerous (wifi is free). There are industrial design touches in its lights and fittings, while a flourish-free bed, wardrobe and mirror-frame have a woodchip-effect. It’s all functional and sturdy – with brightness provided by a colourful mural – but lacks an overall aesthetic, which explains the team’s search for ideas. The feel of the hostel (and communal spaces) is friendly and secure, aided by a reception staffed 247.What’s on the doorstep?Liverpool’s compact centre means a short stroll to everything, from shopping at Liverpool One (7 minutes) to the museums, Mersey ferry terminal and waterfront grandeur of Pier Head and The Three Graces (Royal Liver Building, Cunard Building and Port of Liverpool Building 12 minutes). Closer still are the Cavern Club on Mathew Street and the World Museum and Walker Art Gallery, as well as my favourite: Central Library, featuring the Victorian Grade II-listed Picton Reading Room. With Love Thy Neighbour not open for dinner on the Sunday of my stay, I savoured the small dishes and tiffin tins of Mowgli Street Food on Water Street and micro-distillery gins of Liverpool Gin Distillery (tastings and classes available) on Castle Street.How much?Dorm beds from £15, private rooms from £30.• sleepeatlove Robert Hull• Accommodation and meals were provided by Sleep Eat Love and Love Thy NeighbourLooking for a holiday with a difference?

The series, which exists along the same lines as Seven Up, took 25 British babies, born at the start of the new millennium, and followed them over several years. Archive footage from the very beginning shows experts suggesting that we were looking at “a better society, a better world for our children”.That was 20 years ago. In a series of rapid-fire news compilations, we see that a lot has happened in the lifetimes of the children and families who signed up (for anyone who watched Russell T Davies’s apocalyptic drama Years and Years, there is a worrying tang of familiarity to the clips). These kids were born before 911, before the financial crisis, before anyone much cared about the EU. The average price of a house when this series began was less than £80,000 fewer than half of people owned mobile phones.The programme-makers make the wise decision to concentrate on three of the children, now in early adulthood, though some of the others appear occasionally, with insights of their own. This episode is also dedicated to participant Parys Lapper, the son of the artist Alison, who died last year. He was, they say, a much-loved member of the Child of Our Time family.Eve, named after the grandmother who died when her own mother was pregnant with her, was born to evangelical Christian parents. She talks of her mother warmly, in the past tense. Her story is one of grief, then in 2009, we see her with her father and sister, setting a balloon loose next to a memorial tree. But she also talks about coming out as gay, and how, at 15, it seemed like the most important thing about her, and how at 20, it is not necessarily what she feels compelled to tell people when she meets them for the first time. She is training to be a midwife now, inspired, perhaps, she thinks, by her mother’s caring manner.Jamie had an idyllic-sounding childhood, which he remembers with clear fondness and affection. He was diagnosed with type one diabetes, and recalls some moments of teenage abandon that served as a wake-up call. But the story threaded through his life is of his parents’ marriage and orce, how good his father was as a dad, and how his father’s affair made him realise how much he would come to value honesty in his own life. He is a chef, and his girlfriend is pregnant. He knows the kind of father he plans to be.The parents take a leading role in the story of Rhianna’s life, too. A sensitive child, she feared breaking the rules to such an extent that her parents took her to see a psychiatrist, who gently pointed out that he recommends the reduction of “family conflict” to most of the parents he sees. Rhianna’s parents eventually separated, and she is now studying psychology, trying to understand where she came from.As a tool of child psychology, the series is able to see how lives have unfolded, at every crucial stage, with the benefit of hindsight, and it does seem to confirm the Philip Larkin edict about what one’s parents can do to you. It is even more effective, though, as a portrait of Britain through two decades. Some of the statistics are alarming, such as the growth of reported depression and anxiety in young people, but some are soothing, too, such as the reduction of stigma around discussing personal problems. Any potential for the mockery of a generation of “snowflakes” is given short shrift here, not pointedly, but by example. These young people are articulate, sensitive and sympathetic, and they are clearly also robust.At first, it struck me as unusual that these young adults now can see their lives in this way, captured and archived. Two of the subjects talk about traumatic parts of their lives and how they suspect they have deliberately forgotten about them. But Child of Our Time has footage of those periods. One of the key developments of the past 20 years, though, is that almost everyone’s life is documented now, thanks to smartphones. Their experience has become everyone’s experience, making its resonance even more profound.

Sandi Toksvig stepped down in January after co-presenting the show for three years.Lucas said in a statement: “I’m chuffed to bits to be joining the most delicious show on television. I can’t wait to break bread with Noel, Prue and Paul and meet the brilliant bakers. And bearing in mind my love of cake, I’ve already ordered some much larger trousers in anticipation. See you in the tent!”Fielding said: “I love Matt. I love his warmth and his comedy and his big joyful smile. I think if we play our cards right we could become the next Chas and Morph.”Paul Hollywood described Lucas as a “fantastic addition to the team”, while his fellow Bake Off judge Prue Leith said: “The combination of Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding! Will we stop laughing and get any filming done?”The show was presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins from 2010 to 2016 when it was broadcast by the BBC. It moved to Channel 4 in a £75m deal after the corporation refused to pay the production company Love Productions £25m a year.The former Bake Off contestants Liam Charles and Nadiya Hussain and the comedian Jo Brand were among the names rumoured to be in contention to take over from Toksvig, who also presents the BBC quiz show QI.Ian Katz, Channel 4’s director of programmes, said: “We’re thrilled that one much-loved national institution is joining another. Matt has everything it takes to be a Great Bake Off presenter: he’s warm, hilarious and loves cake.”Bake Off remains a hugely popular franchise for Channel 4 despite viewing figures falling from a peak in 2015, when 14.5 million people watched the series finale won by Hussain. The last series, won by David Atherton, was plagued by criticism of its increasingly difficult challenges.Toksvig’s final presenting stint, on the spinoff Stand Up to Cancer series, is currently airing.Lucas first came to prominence on the comedy quiz show Shooting Stars and is best known as a co-creator and star of Little Britain alongside David Walliams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b21326bb6d6ada91a137f02dce2cf3848096d5c/0_97_2905_1743/master/2905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea48b143a3df90ee76d4e9523de1afed","title":"bernie sanders stay in drag biden left movement lives 2020 democratic election","story":"Bernie Sanders vowed to attend the upcoming Democratic debate after a string of primary losses, and posed questions for his rivalFrom his hometown of Burlington, Vermont, Bernie Sanders got up to speak on Wednesday afternoon, after a disappointing night of watching the results from Tuesday’s primaries roll in.Would he stay or would he go? For now, he stays, determined to fight on and try to drag the Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden, to the left, so that even as Sanders’ race effectively peters out, his movement goes on.Although Sanders said he was winning the “ideological debate” against the moderate Biden, and the “generational debate” in terms of older voters pouring to the polls for his rival, he acknowledged he was losing the “electability debate” for the party nomination to fight Donald Trump in the November election.Sanders said he had spoken to a number of voters who supported his policy proposals but backed Biden because they feared Sanders, a self-declared democratic socialist, could not defeat the president.So as voters waited with bated breath to see if he would quit after crushing defeats in primaries in the last 10 days, he vowed to attend the scheduled debate against Biden in Arizona on Sunday night, effectively confirming his campaign goes on.The Vermont senator then previewed the issues he will hammer on in the coming days.“Joe, what are you going to do to end the absurdity of the United States of America being the only major country on Earth where healthcare is not a human right? Are you really going to veto a Medicare for All bill if it is passed in Congress?” Sanders rhetorically asked, referring to his promise of government-provided health insurance for everyone.Then he added, defiantly: “On Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend Joe Biden,” Sanders said.The candidate then left the hastily arranged press conference without taking any questions.It was a diehard move, which may give his fervent supporters solace even as it dismays the Democratic party leadership, which is keen to unite and gear up to face Trump together.The announcement followed a disheartening night for Sanders in the principal party nominating races on Tuesday night.Missouri, one of the closest contests of the 2016 election, was called just moments after polls closed in favor of his opponent, Joe Biden, former vice-president to Barack Obama. The same went for Mississippi, where the overwhelmingly African American Democratic vote went for Biden by a landslide on Tuesday, continuing a southern sweep he began in the South Carolina primary and continued through last week’s Super Tuesday contests from Virginia to Texas.It was the beginning of a bleak night for the senator, his second in as many weeks. Not long after the Missouri result, Biden won Michigan, a battleground state Sanders could not afford to lose.Sanders now faces a dramatic choice about the future of his candidacy: to continue leading a grinding, uphill battle or to bow to pressure to drop out for the sake of party unity as it faces up to Donald Trump in the November election.“Prematurely writing him off is about the worst thing that we could do,” Congressman Ro Khanna, one of Sanders’ national co-chairs, said. Sanders “represents the least fortunate, the most vulnerable, and, in certain cases, the most angry about the economic system”.“We need him to continue to express their voice, their needs and their concerns,” he said.Sanders was silent about his future on Tuesday night, ceding the moment to Biden who appears to be on an unstoppable march to the nomination after a string of victories.“This campaign is taking off,” Biden declared in Philadelphia, where he celebrated the night after being forced to cancel an event in Cleveland out of concern over the coronavirus outbreak.It was a dramatic reversal of fortunes for the rivals, virtually the last two standing after a wild and unpredictable primary season.Not two weeks ago, Biden’s campaign appeared on the verge of collapse as Sanders became the frontrunner for the party’s nomination. But South Carolina voters revived Biden, setting him up for a string of victories that relegated Sanders to a more familiar position: underdog.In 2016, when the odds looked longer, Sanders continued his anti-establishment run against Hillary Clinton despite loud calls for him to exit the race.And last fall he fought on after suffering a heart attack only to rebound, overtake Elizabeth Warren’s lead and, for a time, top the field. Though Biden has solidified his delegate lead over Sanders, he remains far short of the 1,991 pledged party delegates required for an outright victory at the national convention in July, where the party will formally choose a nominee.The Sanders campaign had once eagerly sought a two-person contest with Biden to clarify their starkly different visions for the country. But four years after his “Feel the Bern” insurgent challenge revived the party’s left wing, the stakes are different. Democratic voters have made clear that their overriding priority is to beat Trump and, over the course of two consequential election nights, have decided that Biden is their safest hope of accomplishing that.Sanders struggled to make inroads with African American voters, who overwhelmingly backed Biden. Suburban voters who propelled Democrats’ takeover of the House in 2018 turned out in record numbers for his opponent. Despite Sanders dominating support among young voters, youth turnout has been flat or down compared with 2016.Since South Carolina, Biden has racked up dozens of endorsements from elected officials in key battleground states and Congressional leaders. And on Tuesday night, Democratic officials began to declare the primary over and urge the party to turn to the delicate task of unity in the wake of a contested primary battle.“The math is now clear,” said Guy Cecil, the head of Priorities USA, the most powerful Democratic Super Pac, or political action committee, organizations that fundraise and drum up support outside a candidate’s official campaign machine.“Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for president,” the South Carolina congressman James Clyburn, who endorsed Biden, told NPR that the Democratic National Committee should consider moving to “shut this primary down” and “cancel the rest of these debates”. The next Democratic debate, now down to just Sanders and Biden, is on Sunday in Phoenix, Arizona, ahead of voting in that state on 17 March.But Sanders’ campaign signaled there would be no such ending.Briahna Joy Gray, a national press secretary for the Sanders campaign, said she looked forward to the next debate, when “America finally gets to see Biden defend his ideas, or lack there of”. David Sirota, a longtime Sanders adviser, wrote that “tough primaries” produce the strongest nominees. “Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise,” he said. “Not over indeed,” added Nina Turner, a national co-chair of Sanders campaign.Two days after the Phoenix debate, Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio hold primaries. Sanders lost all of them in 2016 and polls show him trailing Biden by a wide margin in Florida, which has the most delegates up for grabs that night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5695715e38c31d641f57a279d36537b99be929/0_360_4011_2407/master/4011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c68b97c24bb48a66f8dfb9f39b390f27","title":"coronavirus symptoms should i see doctor covid 19","story":"What is Covid-19, how does it spread, what are the symptoms, and at what point should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

The measures come the day after the UK recorded the biggest single-day increase in virus cases, and the number of associated deaths rose to eight.The prime minister will chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee at lunchtime, and is expected to rubber-stamp a decision to move to from the “contain” phase to “delay”.The change raises the prospect of measures such as home working, school closures, limits on gatherings, and a scaling back of non-urgent hospital, police and fire services.The delay phase of the plan involves much of the same advice to people as the contain phase, including washing hands, quarantining, and testing.The government’s coronavirus plan states that possible actions include “population distancing strategies such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings”.It adds: “We would consider such measures in order to protect vulnerable iniduals with underlying illnesses and thus at greater more at risk of becoming seriously affected by the disease. The effectiveness of these actions will need to be balanced against their impact on society.”Ministers will hold cross-party talks with Labour on Thursday about the emergency legislation required to implement and enforce some of these measures.

Two patients in Dudley and Nuneaton, who were both aged over 70 and had underlying health conditions, died after contracting Covid-19, health officials said.Earlier, the death was announced of a 53-year-old British woman in Bali, Indonesia, who was already critically ill when she was diagnosed. She is believed to be the youngest British victim and the second to die overseas from the virus.The woman had been on a family holiday with her husband and four children at the island’s Four Seasons hotel. They arrived on 29 February and it was unclear where she contracted the virus. She first reported a fever on 3 March, health officials said.“The patient had severe illnesses including diabetes, hypertension, hyperthyroid and lung disease,” said Achmad Yurianto, a spokesman for Indonesia’s virus response team. She was cremated in Bali at the family’s request. Her husband is under observation in hospital and her children are in quarantine, according to local reports.In what is believed to be the first UK case in a care home, a staff member of a residential home for people with learning and physical disabilities in Desborough, Northamptonshire, was confirmed to have tested positive. The Heather Holmes facility cares provides accommodation for up 12 working-age adults.The Office for National Statistics said a member of staff at its headquarters in Newport, south Wales, had tested positive, as Public Health Wales reported that cases in the country had increased by four to 19.Barclays said an employee at its Canary Wharf office in London had tested positive and that it would deep-clean and disinfect the site.The government’s expected move to the “delay” phase over coronavirus comes after Hancock was pressed by MPs in the Commons over the government’s handling of the outbreak.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, asked Hancock to explain why the government had not already shifted to delay. Pointing to concerns raised by the editor of the Lancet, he said: “There are those in the science community suggesting that we are not following the epidemiology in the right way, suggesting that perhaps we are placing too much emphasis on behavioural science.”Downing Street has involved experts in behavioural psychology in deciding the government’s response, but the health secretary insisted the response was being guided by the best medical advice.He asked Hancock whether it was still plausible to think the virus could be contained. The health secretary replied that the World Health Organization’s decision to declare Covid-19 a pandemic had “a significant impact on the way that countries around the world will now take forward their plans”.The former business secretary Greg Clark pointed to the number of patients being tested for the virus declining in recent days, and asked how quickly capacity could be increased.Hancock insisted the government was “rolling out a big expansion of testing” but declined to give a specific timetable.Meanwhile, the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, announced that Brexit talks planned for next week could be in doubt after European officials raised concerns about the spread of the virus.The NHS has confirmed plans to increase coronavirus testing from about 1,500 suspected cases a day to 10,000.Phillip Meyer, a businessman from Kent, said he and his son had been waiting nine days for a coronavirus test after getting a cough following a trip to northern Italy. He said: “We are testing between 1,000 and 2,000 people a day in the UK, so clearly there is a bottleneck. If in South Korea they test 15,000 a day, why can’t we do that here?”A retired intensive care doctor told the  that the increase had come “way too late” after he and his friends were repeatedly refused tests despite falling ill following a skiing trip to Ischgl, in Austria. The 55-year-old doctor from Chichester, who gave his name only as Andrew, said: “They may be upping the testing but they haven’t put Ischgl on a high-risk list, despite knowing about this for days.

The current eco-design directive sets energy efficiency standards for computers, TVs, dishwashers and washing machines.Virginijus Sinkevičius, European commissioner for the environment, said the “circular economy” plan was a new economic model for the continent. “The linear growth model of ‘take, make, use discard’ has reached its limits,” he told reporters. “With the growth of the world population and consumption, this linear model pushes us closer and closer to a resource crisis. The only way ahead is decoupling economic growth from extraction of primary resources and their environmental impacts.”He said that without the “circular economy” plan the EU could not meet its target for zero-emissions by 2050 or reduce pressure bioersity.Upgrading the eco-design law is one strand of the EU’s European Green Deal, a plan to transform Europe’s economy in the fact of the climate emergency.An earlier upgrade to the eco-design law to set energy efficiency standards for toasters and kettles was abandoned over a feared public backlash, after a hostile tabloid campaign during the Brexit referendum.The law will have to be agreed by EU member states and the European parliament.The commission is also considering an EU-wide scheme that would enable consumers to sell or return old phones, tablets and chargers. It also wants to introduce a common charger.Also promised in the plan:At least some of the measures will apply to the UK, as technology companies will not make goods to a different standard for the smaller British market. While negotiations between the EU and UK on a free trade agreement are ongoing, it is unclear whether the UK will follow all EU standards.The EU wants the UK to match European environmental and consumer protection standards. Without mentioning the UK directly, the recycling plan states that Brussels will “ensure” that future free trade agreements “reflect the enhanced objectives of the circular economy”.Monique Goyens, the director of the European Consumer Organisation, said the action plan was crucial to make the green transition a reality. “If we want consumers to play their part, it should be easy, convenient and affordable for them to shop sustainably, which is far from being the case today.”Some environmental campaigners criticised the commission led by Ursula von der Leyen for not attempting to reduce consumption.“It is absurd, given that the EU consumes nearly three planets’ worth of resources, that reducing absolute consumption is not at the core of the plan,” said Meadhbh Bolger, resource justice campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe. “The Von der Leyen commission’s plan for a circular economy is out of touch with the reality and urgency of the planetary emergency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00fa13581d1811a7ce8a912349d263614e0a6b1c/0_0_4176_2506/master/4176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bae16d9065d12c3a19c07df5a135a23","title":"research finds huge impact of interventions on spread of covid 19","story":"The rapid spread of coronavirus around the world could have been substantially curtailed if the broad swath of measures China brought in to control the outbreak were introduced just weeks earlier, researchers say.Sophisticated modelling of the outbreak suggests that China had 114,325 cases by the end of February 2020, a figure that would have been 67 times higher without interventions such as early detection, isolation of the infected, and travel restrictions.“From a purely scientific standpoint, putting in place a combination of interventions as early as possible is the best way to slow spread and reduce outbreak size,” said Prof Andrew Tatem at the University of Southampton.The population mapping group WorldPop at Southampton ran models on human movement and illness onset to simulate different outbreak scenarios in cities in mainland China. The models reveal how combinations of interventions and when they are introduced affects the speed and transmission of the disease.The study suggests it was crucial to move fast with the interventions China used to contain the outbreak. If testing, isolation and travel bans were brought in one, two or three weeks later than they were, the number of cases could have rocketed three, seven and 18-fold respectively.Tatem said the modelling did not include political factors, such as weighing up the restrictions against the social and economic damages and disruption such aggressive measures can have.“Of the three types of intervention we looked at, the early detection and isolation of cases likely had the strongest impact, and this is something that seems to have been in place early and been done effectively in the UK compared to other countries, such as the US,” Tatem said.“The other two types of interventions, social distancing and travel restrictions, I think do need to be looked at seriously in the coming days.”The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, also found that isolation of the infected and social distancing, such as cancelling large public events, working from home and closing schools, are expected to have a much greater impact on containing the virus than travel restrictions.Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, said the results were encouraging in suggesting that a Covid-19 epidemic could be controlled. “What is less clear from this analysis is what should happen next,” he said. In one scenario the scientists look at, lifting travel restrictions risks a second wave of infections unless contact rates are kept low. “Can that be done, and for how much longer? When can normal life resume?” he said.Rowland Kao, professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University, said interpreting the results for the UK should be done with caution. “The results themselves should not be interpreted as being universal. They will of course depend on the inidual circumstances of each country or region, where the controls are put in place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/559c4e2fefa1438f4f034fb20ea2e312c4d5c14e/0_61_1666_1000/master/1666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd1544140e5ff3512ed75e4205e66c2","title":"tell us your experiences testing for the coronavirus","story":"If you work for Public Health England (PHE) or NHS 111 we want to hear from youTo ease the strain on Public Health England, NHS hospital laboratories will test swab samples from people who display symptoms of coronavirus﻿.We want to hear from people working for PHE and NHS 111 about their experiences of testing people for coronavirus.

Tropical weather regularly interrupts trade. Even when they’re hundreds of kilometres away, cyclones wreak havoc on shipping. Isolation and deprivation define our lives. We know better than most how to cope.So imagine our bemusement when we see ranks of empty shelves in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the USA, denuded by people who pretty clearly have never dealt with a shortage before.And when we read about fisticuffs in suburban grocery stores over toilet paper, of all things… well, we’d facepalm, but that’s unsanitary.Since 2003, I’ve endured half a dozen or so supply shortages as a result of cyclones and too many near misses to count.My house has blown downAnd my garden is goneAnd I don’t know what shipMy next meal is on.Take it from someone who’s dealt with disruptions before. You’re facing two challenges: shortages, which probably won’t be terrible and isolation, which can be.But first, the world won’t run out of toilet paper. Your city won’t run out. Your neighbourhood store wouldn’t either, if you’d just leave some on the shelves. The same goes for canned foods.Fortunately for everyone, the electricity and water supplies aren’t at risk from coronavirus, so refrigeration, communication, and light aren’t a problem. Count your blessings. A friend wisely observed once that the only real luxuries in life are hot water on a cold day, and cold water on a hot one.If you have the cash to spare, there’s no harm laying in a few weeks’ worth of staples. No need to overdo it, experts and officials say enough food to tide you over for two weeks if you’re forced to self-isolate should do it in most places.If you do choose to lay in supplies, don’t forget the small stuff. Sartre said “Hell is other people”. I say it’s two weeks of rice without sauce.Back in 2004, cyclone Ivy stranded me on the island of Ambae. It took weeks to restore contact with the outside world. Within days, we were scouring the dregs of my host’s spice rack in order to make our daily plate of rice more palatable. That was an adventure that quickly stopped being fun.Don’t get caught unprepared. Keep a supply of your favourite sauces and dry seasonings, the ones you love so much you’re willing to end up hating them. Because you will.Other advice if you are stockpiling: buy things you know how to cook, nothing else. This is no time to experiment. Any tasty snacks you buy will be gone in 48 hours. Though I do recommend keeping a secret chocolate stash, so you can savour that.And think about others. The people who most need to stockpile are the least able.If you ask me, isolation is harder to cope with than any shortage. If we see widespread home-quarantining, and people forced to self-isolate for weeks to manage the spread of the virus, most of us are going to be distanced or alone for the first time in our lives. Kindness is going to matter more than ever.If you do end up quarantined, your greatest enemy will be boredom. I remember being trapped by a cyclone in a single room with three brilliant friends. We started out in high-minded discourse solving all the world’s problems, but twenty hours later we were reduced to debating whether Boutros Boutros Ghali or Kofi Annan was hotter. (Kofi, of course. Like it was even close.)Things get silly – or serious – fast. You can either roll with it, or it will roll on you. Lighten up and you’ll make it through.And be kind, even when you don’t feel kind. We’re all alone in this together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8091428a3b59cec1d80d919d955d5ef46167063c/0_133_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b9bd2a64ac6831c3589edb31cee6239","title":"coronavirus live updates who declares pandemic as italy introduces stricter measures","story":"Global recession fears intensify Tom Hanks tests positive in Australia NBA basketball season suspended indefinitely. Follow the latest.This is Matthew Weaver taking over the blog in London where we’re the UK government is poised to move from the contain to the delay phase in its plan to tackle coronavirus. Please let me know if you have any news or tips you think I should be including in our coverage, either at matthew.weaver@the or via Twitter on @matthew_weaverPA has a useful guide on what to expect after Boris Johnson approves the move to the delay phase at a Cobra meeting this morning. The delay phase will see a mixture of the same advice given out, such as encouraging the washing of hands regularly, while also introducing social restriction measures to slow the spread of the virus.How will it help deal with the outbreak?The end goal of the delay phase is to slow the rate of coronavirus being contracted and allow the NHS to clear the annual winter pressure it faces.It would also provide a buffer to allow a possible vaccine to be developed, although this would not come into use for at least another year. The government’s planning document explained: “The benefits are that if the peak of the outbreak can be delayed until the warmer months, we can reduce significantly the risk of overlapping with seasonal flu and other challenges, societal or medical, that the colder months bring.“The delay phase also buys time for the testing of drugs and initial development of vaccines andor improved therapies or tests to help reduce the impact of the disease.”What do they mean by social restrictions?According to the government’s published action plan, the restrictions being considered would have “social costs”. These are thought to include urging employees to work from home where possible and even shutting down schools and cancelling events where masses of people will gather. Is it the same as what is happening in Italy and China?The severity of the interventions have differed on a country by country basis.China and Italy have put full scale lock downs in place, with court action and fines threatened for people breaking imposed curfews.Wuhan, the Chinese city of 11 million people, which was at the centre of the initial outbreak, temporarily shut down its public transport network.And in countries such as France and Spain, large public gatherings have been banned in a bid to prevent widespread contamination.Are sporting events at risk?Football matches in the European countries, including Paris Saint-Germain’s Champions League tie against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, have been played behind closed doors as a result of bans on gatherings of 1,000 people or more.But there is doubt about whether the UK would follow suit after the deputy chief medical officer suggested scientific research did not back up the decision to outlaw public events.Dr Jenny Harries, in a video exchange with the PM on Wednesday, said: “In general, those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect, so we don’t want to disrupt people’s lives.”Why is the UK not doing the same as Italy?Johnson suggested the decisions had come about because “politicians and governments around the world are under a lot of pressure to be seen to act, so they may do things that are not necessarily dictated by the science”.Why has it taken so long to move from the contain phase to delay?Ministers have regularly stated that implementing tough social clampdowns too early can prove counterproductive as the public could tire of the restrictions, but it appears the PM and his advisers feel the time is right to escalate delay preparations.Current advice, including washing hands and catching coughs and sneezes with tissues before binning them will continue during the delay period, as will trying to find and isolate coronavirus cases at an early stage.That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan. I’m handing over to my colleague Matthew Weaver now for the latest. If you’re just joining us, hello and welcome to what has been a very busy few hours in coronavirus news worldwide. Here’s the very fresh Coronavirus: At a glance. Greece reported its first fatality from a coronavirus infection on Thursday, a 66-year-old man who had returned from a religious pilgrimage to Israel and Egypt at the end of February. The deceased had underlying health issues, the health ministry said in a statement. There were 99 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Greece by late Wednesday. Separately, passengers on board a ferry boat were quarantined as a precaution after a crew member said he felt unwell, a health ministry spokesman said. The crew member disembarked for further health checks. The Athens News Agency reported there were 341 passengers and 77 crew on board the ferry which was currently docked at port on the island of Limnos.Here’s the latest on Formula 1 coronavirus news: Amid fears that the coronavirus is already spreading in the Formula One paddock at the Australian Grand Prix, the world champion Lewis Hamilton has admitted he is “shocked” the race is going ahead. Up to eight team members have now been tested for the coronavirus and placed into self-isolation as further doubt is cast over the running of the race on Sunday. Hamilton delivered a withering assessment of why he believed the meeting was taking place, commenting that “cash is king”.With European markets opening shortly, here is a brief look at what the reaction to Trump’s measures – as well as the Australian government’s stimulus package – have been in Australia. Preventing Japanese from gathering to enjoy cherry blossom season because of coronavirus would be like “taking hugs away from Italians,” the governor of Tokyo said on Thursday.Yuriko Koike however urged people to refrain from traditional “hanami” parties where friends and family gather under cherry blossom trees for food and drink, AFP reports. After a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Koike said: “We discussed what to do with hanami. It is open-air. The metropolitan government wants people to admire the flowers.”“I think taking hanami away from the Japanese is like taking away hugs from Italians,” she said.“But we would like to ask people to refrain from, for example, spreading blue tarps and enjoying fun parties at Ueno Park like every year,” she added, referring to a large central Tokyo park popular with revellers.Meteorologists expect cherry blossoms to begin blooming around March 17 in Tokyo.More on actors Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, who announced today that they have tested positive for coronavirus while in Australia.  can confirm that the couple is now in isolation in a hospital on Queensland’s Gold Coast. Here’s everything we know so far: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte will be tested for the new coronavirus Thursday after he meets with Cabinet officials who were exposed to infected people and have now self-quarantined, officials said Thursday.Duterte has no symptoms of Covid-19 but wanted to make sure he is healthy and could continue to engage with the public. Philippine health officials have reported 49 cases of infections and two people, a Chinese and a Filipino, have died.Duterte on Monday declared a state of public health emergency when the number of people infected with coronavirus rose to 33 from just 3 cases last week. Meanwhile in Formula One news from Australia, Reigning F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton says:“I am really very surprised that we are here. For me it is shocking that we are all sitting in this room (press conference).”More F1 team members were tested for the coronavirus at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne earlier today, as further doubt was cast on the running of this weekend’s race. No results have yet been made available. Two members of the Haas team and one from McLaren, who were identified with fever symptoms on Wednesday, underwent tests for the coronavirus before going into self-isolation.We’ll have more on this shortly. As Europe wakes up, we’re seeing more reaction to Donald Trump’s travel ban announced late on Wednesday from the Oval Office.The ban, in case you’re just joining us is on foreign citizens entering the US if they have been in Europe in recent weeks. The 30-day curbs, starting Friday, exclude Britain, Ireland and other countries outside the European Schengen passport-free travel area. China is focusing on restarting factories and businesses hit by strict containment policies which prevented millions of people from travelling and returning to work after extended China Lunar New Year holidays. Factory activity plunged to its worst level on record in February, and while more businesses have reopened in recent weeks as containment measures are eased, analysts do not expect activity to return to normal levels until April.Australian supermarket chain Woolworths has announced further restrictions on certain goods amid wide-spread panic buying in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.On Thursday the company announced it would begin rationing tissues, hand sanitiser, paper towels and rice. It also announced a further restriction on the sale of toilet paper. The company had previously introduced a four-pack per person limit on toilet paper after shelves were left bare by shoppers fearing being caught without a domestic essential.The new limits are:China had eight new coronavirus infections in Hubei province as of the end of Wednesday, the first time the epicentre of the pandemic recorded a daily tally in single-digits, as more businesses reopened with local authorities cautiously easing strict containment measures. As the spread of the virus continues to slow, Hubei province announced on Thursday a further loosening of travel restrictions and will also allow some industries to resume production in two of its cities and two counties. A dramatic attempt by Donald Trump to limit the spread of coronavirus by banning travel to the US from most of Europe for 30 days has failed to stem heavy losses on financial markets and prompted one top economist to warn that a global recession was now “highly probable”.In a sombre primetime address from the Oval Office on Wednesday evening, the US president boasted that the travel ban and series of other measures designed to cushion the economic blow of the outbreak amounted to “the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in history”.But Asian stock markets and Wall Street futures trading plunged deep into the red even as Trump laid out his plans, with investors betting that the $250bn package would not be enough to reverse the creeping shutdown of the world’s largest economy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4200326.1583970734!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus trinity college confirms second positive test for covid 19","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTrinity College Dublin has said a student has been diagnosed with Covid-19.

It has already replaced physical lectures with online classes in an attempt to limit the coronavirus threat.However, tutorials, seminars and laboratory practicals will continue to be given in the usual fashion while using social distancing protocols.“The present policy of delivering lectures online from Monday will continue and all students and staff should follow the guidelines around social distancing and good hygiene,” said the college.“Our goal should be to decrease the number of instances that lead to students, staff, and visitors coming together in large groups in close proximity with each other.“There is some false information circulating about Covid-19 on social media at present, including manipulated images.

Photograph: Alex WelshThe New York TimesAre you washing your hands correctly? While most Irish people have become much more focused when it comes to hand hygiene in recent days as fears over the impact of coronavirus have grown, a leading virologist at Trinity College Dublin has warned that the techniques employed by many are still wrong and could leave viruses on hands and fingernails.Using UV lights and a reflective cream to mimic the spread of a virus, the leader of the virology research group at Trinity, Dr Kim Roberts, was able to show just how hard it can be to clean human hands effectively.When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets of saliva or mucus. These droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands, then transferred when someone touches their face, causing infection.That is why frequent hand-washing and the use of hand sanitisers are so important in combating the spread of the Covid-19.Dr Roberts demonstrated how quick hand-washes were utterly useless and only served to spread the virus to arms and clothes, while even a relatively vigorous handwashing was only partially effective.She reminded people that not only do they need to wash their hands “for a minimum of 20 seconds”, they also need to allow soap to do its work before rinsing hands in water.FingernailsShe highlighted the need to ensure all parts of the hands including fingernails were washed with equal vigour.The HSE, the Department of Health and all medical experts have been reinforcing the need for people to take greater care with hand hygiene in order to curtail – in so far as is possible – the spread of coronavirus.The results of a huge study in 2015, and published in the Lancet, proved the importance of hand washing to prevent the mass spread of an illness such as coronavirus.Researchers at the University of Southampton randomly ided more than 20,000 people from GP lists into two groups, one of which was invited to visit a website designed to encourage people to wash their hands, while the other group didn’t get access.While effects weren’t huge, with 10-20 per cent reductions in infections and consultations among the former group, these small effects extrapolated to population level would produce huge benefits from a cheap and easily accessed intervention.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4200211.1583957747!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus is circulating among us more widely than data shows","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Polish border guard checking for coronavirus  on the Polish-Slovakian border.  Those countries that have done best in limiting the spread of the virus have done so by testing large numbers of people,. Photograph: . EPADarek DelmanowiczIreland’s first death from coronavirus makes this country the 29th to suffer a fatality from the disease.It is clearly also a momentous turn of events in our battle against the disease, which began just 12 days ago with the announcement of the first confirmed case in our health system.For one family it is also a personal tragedy sadly it will not be the only one before things start to get better.It is important to stress that the woman who has died was both elderly and had an underlying condition. All we know about this new disease tells us it hits people in these categories hardest. This is not to minimise what has happened, merely to place it in a context.Most people who are in good health – most of the population – have relatively little to fear from Covid-19, and will suffer only mild symptoms.What is particularly worrying about this case is the fact that the woman acquired the disease in the community. She had no known history of travel, so the virus must have been transmitted locally.We now have two such cases involving community transmission, in Cork and Naas. The first that was reported occurred almost a week ago, and yet remains a mystery.The only logical conclusion to reach from this information, and the one favoured by a number of GPs I have talked to in recent days, is that Covid-19 is in circulation among us more widely than is indicated by just these cases.SymptomsAs a result, and in common with other countries that have been slow to ramp up testing, we really don’t know how many cases we have. By and large we only know of those cases we have “discovered” because they had symptoms, came home from Italy and tested positive.As I’ve said previously, these travel criteria were too tightly circumscribed for too long they still are, given the widespread community transmission apparent in many other European countries.Those countries that have done best in limiting the spread of the virus have done so by testing large numbers of people, and then chasing up the leads provided by positive tests as vigorously as possible.Some countries have offered free tests on demand for all who want them others have drive-in centres for testing.South Korea, for example, worked with local biotech companies to develop kits which were used to test more than 140,000 people in a short space of time.Here the National Virus Reference Laboratory moved quickly to establish reliable Irish testing facilities in the earlier stages of the outbreak, but it remains the only location for processing tests nationally.There are plans to widen the availability of testing to regional hospitals, but these need to be expedited so we have the capacity to test more broadly and to produce results more quickly if possible.Concern\u0026nbspIt also makes sense for GPs to be able to refer patients about whom they have concerns directly for testing, instead of having to consult with already overloaded public health officials.Unfortunately, but inevitably, any increase in testing is likely to bring bad news in the form of more positive results. But it is only through having a more accurate picture of the spread of coronavirus in the country that we can make, and time, the restrictions necessary to prevent its spread.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4200041.1583962002!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"galway company says its new type of wipe can capture and trap viruses","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFace masks for sale at  a pharmacy in  Dublin. Photograph:  Dara Mac Donaill A Galway-based campus company has developed a new kind of cleaning wipe which it says could have an “enormous impact” in arresting the spread of coronavirus.Aquila Bioscience, a spin-out company from the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) founded in 2012, has come up with a cellulose-based material for wipes and masks that is designed to capture and trap viruses and other microbes in the material, thereby reducing their transmission.Although the product was originally developed for defence purposes, the company says it can be used effectively to wipe skin and other surfaces clean of coronavirus.The wipes have been trialled on biological threats such as ricin, anthrax and ricin, according to Aquila founder,Prof Lokesh Joshi, a biochemist at NUIG.“At the time no one had heard of Covid-19 but when this hit we found the wipes have a specific chemistry that can capture this virus too. The product is in development now, and could have a huge global impact on the current outbreak.”While traditional cleaning agents used in wipes such as bleach or hydrogen peroxide are cheaper, they are problematic for human skin and for the environment. Prof Joshi says the new Abwipe biological decontamination technology is safe to use even around the eyes as well as being biodegradable.Having been tested in Ireland and the Czech Republic following funding from the European Defence Agency, he says the product is now “ready to go”, and the company is liaising with manufacturing partners.It has also been contacted by makers of surgical masks about the possibility of using the technology to provide extra protection for healthcare workers dealing with cases of the disease. PathogensThe cellulose-based material makes use of the natural characteristics of carbohydrate proteins to create a form of “nano-scale” velcro that traps pathogens, according to Joshi.“In nature humans and animals produce milk, urine and salivamucus full of specific proteins and carbohydrates that bind to pathogen cells to protect us. This is what inspired us to develop a mechanism to stop the pathogens ‘running away’ with a wipe.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus q a we are now in uncharted waters","story":"It seems like the world has been turned upside down in recent days as a result of the coronavirus spread. Where are we now?We are in absolutely uncharted waters. And yes the world has been turned upside down. What started out as a flu-like illness passing among a relatively small number of people in Wuhan, a Chinese city most of us had probably never heard of, has spread across the world with frightening speed. At the time of writing – Tuesday, March 10th – more than 110,000 people in over 100 countries have now contracted coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, and almost 4,000 people have died.How serious is it?It is very serious, there is no two ways about it. While the vast majority of people who contract coronavirus will be fine within a couple of weeks, about 15 per cent of people will become very ill while about 5 per cent will get critically ill. The mortality rate of the illness is fluctuating from country to country and from week to week as it spreads, but with the information we have at this stage it looks like about 2 per cent of those who get the illness may die. The number falls dramatically amongst younger people and – so far at least – the percentage of children who have become seriously ill or died is minuscule.How does 2 per cent compare with flu?The mortality rate of Covid-19 is about 20 times higher than the seasonal flu. And while a mortality rate of around 2 per cent may seem small, if the disease takes hold in a country and many people are taken ill – as has happened in Italy – it can quickly equate to thousands of deaths and an enormous volume of people requiring hospital treatment. There are few countries in the world that are in a position to cope with the demands such a situation might place on their health system.How fast is it spreading?Fast. Three weeks ago there had been no reported cases in Italy. One way of measuring transmissibility is the virus’s reproduction number or R0 (“R naught”), effectively the number of people an infected person will go on to infect. Estimates from China put the R0 at somewhere between 1.5 and 4, compared with 1.4 for the average flu (and up to 18 for measles).However, R0 varies across different environments. It can be reduced by effective hygiene control measures – handwashing, controlled coughing and sneezing, even social distancing. It is also worth remembering that while the people of Wuhan didn’t know what was about to hit them in December and January, the rest of the world has had more warning.What is the incubation period?The incubation period – the time between infection and the onset of symptoms of the disease such as cough, fever and shortness of breath – is thought to range from two to 14 days.Can you pass it on without symptoms?This is a big area of uncertainty. The European Union’s disease prevention agency is set to tighten its advice on coronavirus in the days ahead as evidence emerges that people showing no symptoms can spread the virus. Until Monday the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) had advised that “people who are infected but who do not show symptoms cannot transmit the virus”, a belief that has influenced policy and quarantine decisions in several EU countries as cases balloon. This was in conflict with advice from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The WHO states that, while rare, “there are people who can shed Covid-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset”.Will we cope in Ireland?The HSE says isolation rooms have been identified in all major hospitals, where patients would be treated. We have only one state-of-the-art isolation unit in the country, in the Mater hospital, but local arrangements and transfers to the Mater would probably suffice in the event of a small number of cases. The fear is that there will be a large number of cases. Emergency medicine doctors have said they don’t have the ICU beds to handle that. One doctor in St Vincent’s hospital has pointed out that he has not had a free ICU bed since Christmas.How many people could fall ill here?The Business Post reported on Sunday, March 8th, that forecasts were suggesting that about 40 per cent of the population could become sick as a result of the virus. Paul Reid of the HSE said he could not dispute reported projections that up to 1.9 million people could become sick as a result of contracting the coronavirus, although he said the work was not yet concluded and the evidence was changing day by day.Can the virus be treated?It cannot be cured, if that is what you are asking. Doctors try to keep critically ill patients’ bodies going, providing breathing support where necessary and waiting for their immune system to fight off the virus. There is no vaccine as yet, though one might be ready by the end of the year. Antivirals are being tested in China, but there are no clear results yet.Do face masks work?People wearing face masks are likely to be the most enduring images of 2020, but many of these devices are not as efficient at preventing the transmission of viruses as people might hope. The consensus now is that regular hand-washing is a far more effective way of protecting yourself. People might derive comfort from masks, but it is worth bearing in mind that they were originally designed to filter the air you breath out and to protect healthy persons from sick persons, rather than the other way around.If I think I have the virus, what should I do?If you’ve come back from one of the affected areas – such as northern Italy where person-to-person transmission is widespread – and you have symptoms, contact your GP urgently and do not leave the house. The principal symptoms are headache, dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain and fever. If you have come back from these areas and are feeling well the advice is to consult the HSE website or ring the HSELive helpline on 1850 24 1850 for advice.How should those being tested behave with co-residents?The HSE advises that family members or people sharing a residence with a suspected case should avoid contact, communicate by phone and not answer calls to the door.What is happening in Ireland now?As of Tuesday, March 10th, the number of people in the Republic who have been diagnosed with the illness is still small. A total of 24 cases of the virus had so far been confirmed, but the outlook for the days, weeks and months ahead is still grim.Are projections of 1.9m sick people an exaggeration?Not according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. He delivered a bleak assessment on Monday, March 9th, of the potential consequences of the coronavirus outbreak in Ireland. “It is possible we are facing events that are unprecedented in modern times,” he said. He warned that more than half of the population could contract Covid-19 and he referenced death rates for the virus ranging from less than 1 per cent to more than 3 per cent, meaning large numbers of people could die of the disease in a worst-case scenario.“For the vast majority of the population this will be a mild illness and may even by asymptomatic,” he said. “However, there will be a significant part of the population who will require critical care.” The virus cannot be stopped, he said, but “it can be slowed” with the right response from the health service and across society.How can it be slowed?There are things that can be done by the Government and its agencies. But there is one thing every person in this country can do to help slow the spread of the virus.What?Yes. There is universal agreement among politicians and health professionals that proper hand sanitation is the most effective thing people can do to stop the spread of the illness. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets of saliva or mucus. These droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands, then transferred when someone touches their face, causing infection. That is why frequent hand-washing and the use of hand sanitisers are so important in combating the spread of Covid-19.And how do I do that properly?To answer that we will turn to the official HSE guidelines.Wet your hands with warm water and apply soap. Rub your hands together until the soap forms a lather. Rub the top of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails. Do this for about 15 seconds. Rinse your hands under running water. Dry your hands with a clean towel or paper towel.What else is being done to stop it spreading here?A lot. A €3 billion package to deal with coronavirus will pump more money into the health service, help at-risk businesses and change the rules around sick pay to encourage people who will need to self-isolate and stay away from their workplaces. An additional €435 million will be allocated to the HSE. Minister for Health Simon Harris has said this money is to be used to increase the public health capacity to trace contacts of people with the virus, as well as providing for more beds, more overtime, more staff and more homecare packages to help take pressure off hospitals.Is there more?There is a lot more. Patients have been told not to turn up at GP surgeries without an appointment in order to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus. And patients who have been to an affected area and are showing respiratory symptoms have been reminded not to go to their GP surgery, hospital emergency department, out-of-hours service or pharmacy. Instead they should phone ahead or call 112.What about public gatherings?All St Patrick’s Day parades across the country are being cancelled on foot of a recommendation of the National Public Health Emergency Team. Trinity College Dublin said all lectures would take place remotely. And both Ryanair and Aer Lingus said they would be cancelling all flights to and from Italy for almost a month. Ryanair is also cancelling all internal flights in Italy for the same period.What about schools?To date only a handful of schools – in Dublin and Clare – have closed following known cases of Covid-19. During a containment phase, wider school closures “are not justified”, the European Centre for Disease Control has said. If transmission of the virus becomes widespread in the days ahead, school closures will be inevitable, even though they probably would not reduce the impact of the epidemic. For now, though, it seems unlikely.What is happening across the EU?According to data from the ECDC on Tuesday, 14,890 cases were reported in the EUEEA and the UK. Italy had reported 9,172 cases, followed by France on 1,412 and Spain on 1,204. Germany had reported 1,139 cases, while there were 321 in the Netherlands and 373 in the UK. Across the EU there were 532 deaths reported, with the vast majority being reported in Italy where – at the time of writing – 464 people had died.Italy is bearing the brunt of the virus?Italy has – so far – been the the epicentre of the outbreak in Europe, and the country’s 60 million people have been placed in lockdown. Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte said after Italy’s death toll jumped by 97 to 463 that it was the country’s “darkest hour”.How are drug supplies in the EU?The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said it is closely monitoring what the spread of Covid-19 could mean for the pharmaceutical supply chains in the EU.Its officials are looking at ways to protect at-risk patients if there is a temporary lockdown of medicine manufacturing sites in areas affected by Covid-19. It is important to stress that there are no reports of such shortages of medicines within the EU.Okay, so talk to me about travel?On Tuesday, March 10th, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney announced an update on his Department’s travel advice, saying no residents of Ireland should travel to any part of Italy unless it is absolutely necessary. The red warning “do not travel” status is extremely unusual and will have to be heeded by everyone.Has it been heeded by airlines?Yes. Both Ryanair and Aer Lingus are suspending all flights to and from and within Italy following the decision of the Italian government to lock down the entire country to contain the spread of virus.Ryanair said the suspension of internal flights would come into force at midnight on Wednesday. Flights into and out of Italy will be suspended at midnight on Friday, March 13th. The measures will be in place until April 8th. Aer Lingus has cancelled all flights to and from Italy from Wednesday, March 11th until April 3rd.What if I am in Italy and not due back until Saturday?There has been no formal comment from Aer Lingus, but Ryanair passengers looking for repatriation can obtain a free move to an earlier Ryanair flight operating up until midnight on Friday, March 13th. Affected passengers who were due to travel to the country will be able to choose between a full refund or a travel credit that can be redeemed on Ryanair flights in the next 12 months.Are the Italian land borders still open?Yes, but the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, has announced an entry ban for people entering Austria from Italy by car, train or plane, unless they can provide a doctor’s certificate. Controls will be imposed along the border between the two countries. Austrians visiting Italy will be allowed to return home only if they agree to a two-week home quarantine.Is Ireland using such controls on those returning from Italy?As yet, no.How will this affect my summer holidays?It is too early to say what impact it is going to have on summer travel. If you had asked us this question two weeks ago we would have said that everything will be grand. Now, we’re not so sure. It could be that by July, the start of the high season for tourism in Europe, the virus will have peaked. Maybe it will be gone altogether. It could be that things will be much worse than they are today. There is too much uncertainty to make a firm decision on your travel plans now.So what advice can you give me?Pay attention to the travel advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and other relevant sources.Is that official advice important?It is very important. If an official advisory against travel is in place then people who have booked independent holidays and have travel insurance to that location could be able to claim for any losses they are likely to incur. With advisories in place, people who have booked with tour operators should also be able to process refunds or reschedule trips.What about flights?According to the European Consumer Centre Ireland (ECC Ireland), a natural occurrence such as Covid-19 that causes travel disruption is considered “extraordinary circumstances” outside the control of a transport provider, such as an airline. Consequently, compensation would not normally apply. For air travel, according to EU Regulation 261, passengers on cancelled flights may be entitled to have their journey either rerouted to the final holiday destination or refunded. If a land or sea journey is cancelled, passengers are entitled to rerouting or a refund.What about package holidays?For package holidays involving a journey to, or a stay in, areas affected by travel restrictions due to the virus, consumers may have the right to terminate the booking contract without paying a termination fee. This applies only to unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances that may pose a significant risk to human health and prevent consumers from making use of or reaching the destination of their booked holiday, as agreed in the travel contract.I am headng overseas soon. Can I cancel?If consumers choose to cancel their holiday to an area where no emergency measures have been declared, that is their right, but the holiday cancellation is, of course, strictly within the limits of their booking contract. Refunds may be possible, but that is by no means certain. And if passengers cancel flights voluntarily they are entitled to a full refund of airport taxes as the cancellation takes place before the flight check-in operation. But it is worth bearing in mind that admin fees imposed by airlines often make such refunds pitifully small.What about travel insurance?Now would be as good a time as any to ensure you have adequate travel insurance covering any trips you may have coming up. Ensure your policy covers cancellations as a result of official warnings from government not to travel to a destination. But timing is crucial here. Mapfre, one of the biggest travel insurance underwriters in the State, says that if a policy covers a government recommendation to avoid a country or area, a claim will be considered only if that recommendation is in place within 48 hours of a person’s intended departure.Anything else?If you are travelling anywhere in the EU in the months ahead and do not have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or think the one you do have may have expired, then get it sorted.Remind me of what the EHIC is again?If you are travelling in Europe, the card gives you access to public health services at no cost. If you have a smartphone, download the EHIC app to help you navigate overseas health systems, and remember: your card needs to be renewed every five years. Don’t ever pay for the card. Some sites will try charging for the service, but it is free through the official site, ehic.ie.What else is happening?This remains first and foremost a public health emergency. But the pandemic is almost certainly tipping the world into a global recession. Airlines and the tourism sector at home and abroad will suffer. Some businesses will close. Stock markets will continue to take a hammering. Pension funds will be hit hard and jobs will be lost.What’s this about stockpiling food and fighting over toilet roll?That is happening alright. In countries as far apart as Japan, Australia and the US there have been reports of panicked shoppers stocking up on everything from long-life milk to noodles, while videos of people fighting in supermarket aisles over toilet paper in Australia have gone viral as coronavirus has spread.Large retail chains in the UK, including Tesco, have started rolling out a rationing system for key products and shoppers are not being allowed buy more than five of certain goods, including antibacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables. Pictures of empty shelves are circulating widely on social media.Is it happening in Ireland?While there has been no formal rationing in Ireland – and no reports of loo roll riots – this country has not been immune to the panic buying and there has been a noticeable surge in the sale of canned goods, pasta and cleaning products in supermarkets here. Items deemed to be essential in the current climate, including hand sanitiser and face masks, have largely disappeared from shelves while wholesalers are reporting sales levels for groceries normally not seen outside of the peak shopping period before Christmas.This is all incredibly gloomy and scary.It is. But it is not forever. Things will settle down. Most experts say several scenarios are possible with Covid-19. It might join the four other existing coronaviruses in being endemic around the world, causing respiratory illness of varying degrees of severity. Or it may become a seasonal illness like the flu, adding to the pressure on hospitals during the winter. It is important to bear in mind that scientists all over the world are working on vaccines and treatments, and while they are still some way off, such treatments will come.So how is this going to turn out?We don’t know. But it is worth looking at China, where this whole thing is believed to have started. Its most recent figures put the number of new cases across the whole country at 19, with 17 additional deaths. It has closed the 14 emergency hospitals it built in Wuhan and Chinese President Xi Jinping flew into the city on Tuesday morning to inspect new coronavirus control efforts, according to state news broadcaster CCTV.Anything else?Just one thing.

We are not choosing.” The move by the Greens, according to sources, reflects unease in the party on entering government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The two Civil War parties will continue discussions on Thursday on a potential coalition. Between them they have 72 Dáil seats, eight short of a majority, and both want the 12 Green TDs, as well as Independents, to help to form a solid government Some of the Independents open to entering government have said the Greens would need to be part of the arrangement even if a majority can be assembled with the support of non-party Deputies alone. “There has to be four legs to it,” said one Independent TD. “This government is going to have to take some difficult decisions, and it needs more than a bare majority.”A Fianna Fáil spokeswoman said: “A government with a majority that prioritises the country as it goes through what is now a global pandemic is what the country needs.“National government is a way of making government less effective, not more. It sidelines parliament and turns government into the place where battles are fought, not where decisions are taken.”A Fine Gael spokesman said: “We intend to continue discussions with the Green Party.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDutch prime minister Mark Rutte gives Bruno Bruins, minister for medical care, an elbow greeting. Photograph: Remko De WaalEPAThe position of Dutch authorities was that only people with symptoms could transmit coronavirus. It was repeated by the government, national and local health authorities, justifying a cascade of decisions that allowed the Netherlands to keep up a “business as usual” attitude even as the virus exponentially spread.The problem was, it was wrong. As early as February 21st, Chinese doctors published a case of apparent asymptomatic transmission German doctors wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine on March 5th to warn of a case near Munich. The World Health Organisation advises transmission without symptoms is possible.Despite this the Dutch government and health authorities stuck to looser quarantine advice than other European countries up to the time of publishing, telling people who had travelled from China, outbreak spots in Italy, and Iran, that they need only self-quarantine if experiencing symptoms.As well as being underpinned by a flawed assumption, the advice relies on people knowing whether they have symptoms or not. This is questionable: Chris Higgins, a GP in Australia, provoked an outcry after treating 70 patients while he had what he thought was the tail end of a mild cold, before he tested positive for Covid-19.It’s also in stark contrast to the approach in the countries most successful at containing the virus, such as Taiwan and Singapore, where authorities drew on their experience of the Sars outbreak to implement strict travel checks and preventative quarantine before even registering a first confirmed case.Inidual freedomsThe case of the Netherlands shows how a flawed belief about transmission filtered down throughout society, enabling the virus to spread. It also makes for a grand experiment in what happens when a country takes a relaxed approach to the virus, placing the maintenance of normality, personal responsibility and inidual freedoms first.The first coronavirus diagnosis in the Netherlands was on February 27th. As authorities traced his contacts, they found he had attended Carnival in the city of Tilburg in the North Brabant region on February 21st-25th. “The patient was not contagious in the days he celebrated the carnival,” the mayor of Tilburg Theo Weterings told media.In the following days, two more people who were at Tilburg carnival were diagnosed with coronavirus. One of them was a worker at Bannink Packaging in Drenthe in the northern Netherlands. His partner was also infected.\u0026nbspBannink Packaging continued to operate as normal, saying the employee was not sick when he came to work. “The chance that he has infected colleagues is therefore rather small,” the spokesperson told media.On March 4th, another Bannink Packaging employee – who commuted from Germany – was diagnosed with coronavirus.\u0026nbsp“In Germany they are a lot stricter with testing . . . We should not exaggerate. Production continues as normal. In that respect, it is business as usual,” a company representative told media. “We advise our employees to stay at home if they have symptoms. We cannot do more.”On March 5th a third employee was diagnosed as positive.\u0026nbspOn March 7th four more people tested positive in Coevorden, where Bannink Packaging is based.That day 900 students of the university society Vindicat returned from a mass ski trip in Piedmont in northern Italy in a convoy of buses to the Netherlands. Amid public concern, authorities met the students and tested four, who were found negative.“Someone who has no symptoms is not contagious,” Jossy van den Boogaard, MD in infectious disease control at local health authority GGD Groningen told media.“Can the students also infect others while they have no symptoms? No,” was the official advice. “What if someone decides to go to work or take an exam? This is their own responsibility.”No panicOn March 8th it was announced that a cleaning lady married to a Bannink Packaging employee had tested positive. The director of the school she works at wrote to parents to say there was no reason to panic, and that children could go to school as normal.By this point the outbreak in the carnival region of North Brabant had reached the point that there were shortages of protective equipment for health workers, and people were advised not to call their doctor unless their symptoms were serious.Lawmaker Eva van Esch told parliament a friend of hers had tested positive who had been refused a test for a week after returning from Italy with symptoms. Once positive, the friend had been asked to keep the diagnosis quiet and not to tell her work or contacts, van Esch said.“My party therefore wonders whether this government is actually focusing on preventing the spread of the disease, or whether the health services are primarily concerned with preventing panic,” van Esch said.Dutch testing capacity is limited, forcing authorities to prioritise testing people with a clear link. Roughly 6,000 tests had been done in the Netherlands as of March 7th, national public health institute the RIVM said, a figure that includes double-testing to exclude false positives, and testing for recovery.Twelve days after the first diagnosis, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Netherlands had risen from 1 to 382.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4200138.1583953007!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit michael gove declines to confirm irish sea checks on goods","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove arriving at the Cabinet Office in London.

Photograph: Luke DrayGettyMichael Gove, the British cabinet minister who will negotiate the implementation of post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, has declined to confirm that checks will be required on goods crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain to the North.Mr Gove told a House of Commons committee that it would be for an EU-UK joint committee to determine how the Northern Ireland protocol should work.“The effective working of the protocol is a matter for the joint committee to resolve and I’m looking forward to that meeting in order to ensure that we can develop the protocol and implement it in all its provisions in a way that ensures that the people of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland economy benefit,” he said.EU negotiators insist that the role of the joint committee, which is due to meet for the first time on March 30th, is limited to determining matters such as which goods are assumed to be destined to remain in Northern Ireland rather than exported to the EU. But the protocol makes clear that Northern Ireland will have to follow the EU customs code, which requires information and checks on goods coming from Great Britain.Irish Sea borderPrime minister Boris Johnson has stated a number of times that there will be no checks and no border in the Irish Sea but Mr Gove said the British government was committed to implementing the protocol in full.“We are committed to making sure that the Northern Ireland protocol is implemented in order to underpin the BelfastGood Friday Agreement. And the point is well understood that the joint committee is there to ensure that it is implemented and also to resolve some of the questions over precisely how,” he said.Mr Gove suggested that the next round of talks between Britain and the EU, which is scheduled to start in London next Wednesday, could be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. And he said the government would not publish an economic impact assessment of the free trade deal it is seeking from the EU.“I am personally sceptical of efforts to say that any given impact assessment by a government department is an accurate prediction of the future. As load-bearing devices go, they are perhaps not the most effective ways of delivering a proper range of views about what the economic consequences of a course of action might be,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But the outcome is no longer in much doubt.Joe Biden’s victories in at least four of the six states that voted in this “mini-Super Tuesday’ – four of which Sanders had won in 2016 against Hillary Clinton – puts the former vice-president into an almost prohibitive lead.Next week’s delegate-rich Florida primary could put him beyond reach. The real question is how long before Sanders bows to the inevitable, and on what terms. On that fraught negotiation – Sanders’s price for endorsing Biden – will hang the unity, or disunity, of the Democratic party.But America’s mind had shifted to the epidemic even before these latest primaries. The grim reality of the spreading coronavirus has rapidly taken hold in the last few days.As the political class speculated over the next round of voting, Americans woke up to the prospect of closing schools, remote working, temporary lay-offs, flight cancellations and the overnight arrival of the new etiquette of “social distancing”.The creeping Italianisation of America’s response has all but shut down the live element of the Democratic campaigns. Both Biden and Sanders have cancelled future rallies. Their next debate – the first with just two of them – will take place on Sunday without an audience.The question of whether America should adopt Italian-style containment is increasingly driving out other issues. Biden will give an address on Thursday laying out how he would tackle the epidemic. Donald Trump is feeding conspiracy theories that Democrats are exaggerating the contagion to trigger a recession. Shortly after Biden said that he was cancelling rallies, Trump announced his own mass gathering this weekend in Milwaukee.As symbolic gestures go, Trump’s addiction to rallies may prove recklessly consequential. Just two weeks ago Trump told America that the number of coronavirus infections was likely to fall to zero. The tally of homegrown infections stood at 15 then. Now 984 are confirmed with the virus.Were the US testing its citizens on the same scale as other countries, the true figure might be as high as 20,000, say epidemiologists – and rising exponentially. The gap between what Trump says and reality cannot be fixed on Twitter.The second issue is an increasingly nasty exchange over mental health. Trump says Biden “doesn’t know where he is or what he’s doing”. Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, said Biden had “dementia”.Public addressesThere is no evidence Biden is suffering from anything other than ageing combined with a life-long stutter. To minimise the opportunities for gaffes – or “Bidenisms” – his aides have sharply curtailed his public addresses to a few minutes.Trump’s team has no such control over the length or content of his appearances. The president’s claim to know more about epidemics than the experts – partly because his uncle was a scientist – reinforces questions about his own mental health. Biden has been responding in kind. Last weekend he ridiculed Trump’s self-description as a “very stable genius”.That debate is brewing amid an epidemic that could trigger a US recession. Bloomberg’s average of forecasters now put the chances of that happening at more than 50 per cent. A recession would be highly damaging to Trump’s re-election chances, as could the perception that he is mismanaging the epidemic.There is also a non-trivial risk that Trump, Biden and Sanders will be exposed to the virus on the campaign trail. Each is likelier to be shaking more hands than almost any other American.Even with a shift to shoulder-clasping, and lots of hand sanitiser, they can hardly stick to the rules of social distancing. As septuagenarians, America’s presidential contenders are in a very high risk category.All of which puts a very different gloss to the customary “stakes are high” election cliches. Welcome to a presidential campaign about the candidates’ sanity. Welcome also to politics in a time of contagion. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Comment: The West\u0026#39s neglect of science has left us chillingly exposed to deadly pandemics Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson infected with coronavirus in AustraliaDonald Trump\u0026#39s travel ban: Who is affected and how will it work?Donald Trump suspends Europe travel to US for 30 days over coronavirus but UK exemptCrossfire: The untold story of Britain\u0026#39s role in the Trump-Russia scandalWhat is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?Where in the UK have cases of coronavirus been detected - and how many are there?Donald Trump\u0026#39s coronavirus address to the nation in fullChelsea Manning in hospital after suicide attemptCricket fan who used dead member\u0026#39s pass to enter Lord\u0026#39s pavilion allowed \u0026#34desperation\u0026#34 to get the better of him\u0026#34, court hears as he is fined £10k British and American soldiers killed in militia rocket attack on base in IraqParking on pavements could be banned across England in crackdown on nuisance motoristsCoronavirus: Eighth UK patient dies as WHO labels outbreak a \u0026#39pandemic\u0026#39 and laments \u0026#39global inaction\u0026#39Cycling commuters nearly 50 per cent more likely to be injured, study findsCriminal wealth of Khazak dictator \u0026#39lives on\u0026#39 in London, High Court McMafia trial toldCoronavirus: UK to enter new phase of emergency measures with admission virus can only be delayed not containedChild of Our Times: Turning 20, review: this millennium baby project has taught us precious littleWomen\u0026#39s groups take CPS to high court over plunging rape chargesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus rising different countries uk among countries seefastest","story":"Most of the countries are in Europe – 11 in total, including the UK, France and Germany. Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden have seen the highest rate of increase over the last week, with cases in Belgium surging by over 3,000 per cent in seven days.As of last Monday, Belgium had just seven active coronavirus cases – but that figure had leaped to 238 as of Monday.The UK saw the fourth-highest increase in cases over the last week, according to data recorded by Johns Hopkins University. There were 299 active coronavirus cases in Britain on Monday, up from 32 at the start of last week – an increase of 834 per cent over the seven days. It took four days for the UK\u0027s number of cases to last double, from 106 on March 5 to 299 on March 9, putting the country in the middle of the pack in terms of the doubling rate of the virus.This is less than the rate of increase in Spain, where active cases have doubled in just two days. There, 460 people were said to have the virus, but that had increase to 1,013 on Monday.The doubling rate is, however, lower in countries in which the virus is already more established and has infected more people. In Japan and South Korea, for example, it took coronavirus nine days to last double its number of active cases.The countries with the highest number of recorded active cases as of Monday were China (18,880), Italy (7,985) and South Korea (7,307).It is important to note that other countries may have higher undetected cases because the official numbers are reliant upon rigorous testing and data collection methods in each country.The number of active cases in China – and in Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus – has fallen over the last week. Hubei has seen active cases drop by 40 per cent since last Monday, while in China the number has dropped by 67 per cent.While cases are still rising in South Korea, the country\u0027s rate of growth has slowed with cases currently doubling every nine days. The most concerning trajectory is in Italy, which has the second highest number of confirmed active cases and is currently seeing that number double every three days. The main goal for the UK Government as it faces coronavirus is to contain and delay it – part of its four-point contain, delay, research and mitigate strategy.This timeline is defined by the likely progress of an outbreak in five scenarios as it moves across Europe, and is taken from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU\u0027s main public health body. But looking at case data from across Europe, it\u0027s clear that different European countries are at different stages of this strategy – and with different levels of success.Most countries managed to delay major surges in cases for at least 20 days as the number of infections in Europe remained low.Daily data sourced from the World Health Organisation and compiled by John Hopkins University shows that some of the worst affected countries were able to contain the disease for weeks.In Italy, the first substantial increase in active cases (533 per cent) did not occur for 21 days after the country had detected its first case. The UK is following a similar trajectory, with a 400 per cent increase in active cases after 24 days.Countries detecting the virus later appear to be less successful in keeping numbers low. In Austria, Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands, the virus was detected for the first time less than two weeks ago. But once it was present, each country saw the number of confirmed cases double – or even triple – in the first three days.Francois Balloux, a professor of computational systems biology at University College London, told The  he thought it likely that the UK would follow the same pattern as Italy over the coming weeks.The trajectory of the epidemic in the UK is so far roughly comparable to the one in Northern Italy, but with the epidemic in northern Italy two to three weeks ahead of the situation in the UK, he said.The above graphic shows the speed at which cases increased in Italy. While lagging in total numbers, confirmed cases in the UK have doubled roughly once every three days in the last week, suggesting that Britain is on much the same track.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus uk enter new phase emergency measures admits viruss","story":"Britain will enter a new phase of its response to the growing coronavirus outbreak, following a £30bn package of measures aimed at postponing the peak of the crisis until June. Boris Johnson will say the UK has moved to the “delay” phase of efforts to battle the virus, and outline social distancing measures expected from the public. A meeting of Cobra on Thursday is expected to discuss the timetable for such moves, which could include asking the elderly to stay home, and encouraging working from home, as well as strict isolation by those with symptoms.  Ministers hope that pumping significant sums into business - including paying the sick pay costs for companies whose workers need time off to self-isolate - means employees are more likely to comply with such measures. As the number of confirmed cases in the UK jumped by more than a fifth overnight, the Budget was aimed at ensuring adherence to such measures, in the hope it could push the worst of an epidemic into early summer.Doing so could reduce the total number of cases in the UK, as viruses tend to spread more quickly in cold weather, and spread out the burden on the NHS, amid fears that 50 per cent of cases could occur in a period of just three weeks.Ministers have already warned that anyone suffering from a cough or cold will soon be ordered to stay home for a week.Wednesday\u0027s budget was aimed at ensuring that everyone urged to “self-isolate” or work from home to reduce the spread of the virus across the population complies with the advice.It followed fears that workers would disregard such instructions, if it threatened their livelihood or left them out of pocket. On Wednesday the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced that the spread of the virus across the globe was now a “pandemic” - the first since swine flu in 2009.Some 118,381 people have now been infected, and 4,292 have died.Urging all nations to ratchet up their response to the crisis, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general said: “We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.”On Wednesday the total number of cases in the UK jumped to 456, including eight deaths.Among the cases is health minister Nadine Dorries, who last week attended a function with the Prime Minister. On Wednesday it emerged that two other MPs were in self-isolation amid fears of outbreak in parliament.It came as UK hospitals were told to create makeshift intensive care units, and to stop treating coronavirus cases in isolation, as pressures on wards soar. On Wednesday the Chancellor scrapped business rates for small firms for the next year as part of a £12 billion package to help get the country through the current crisis.Almost half of all business premises will be exempt from paying rates in the 2020-21 financial year, as the Chancellor said he would do whatever it takes to support the economy.Business loans of up to £1.2m per firm, grants of £3,000 for small businesses and help with footing the bill for sick pay were part of a £7bn package for companies and the self-employed. It also includes a £500m hardship fund to enable councils to help people struggling to pay council tax and other bills.The Chancellor allocated £5bn for the NHS, social care and other local authority spending, with more to come if needed.In his first Budget, Rishi Sunak warned of a significant but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: We will get through this together.The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus. It came hours after the Bank of England announced an emergency cut in interest rates.He also announced a cash boost for theatres, cinemas, pubs and B\u0026ampBs, in a bid to keep people spending money as normal in the wake of the crisis.All alcohol duties were frozen while the hardest-hit entertainment industry were given a tax break to keep it going while people increasingly stay home.The measures were part of a £18billion spending spree, in addition to an emergency £12billion of measures in response to the health crisis.On Thursday  Boris Johnson will outline Britain’s move from “contain” to “delay” of the epidemic.It is likely to include major measures to keep more people at home, especially the most vulnerable. Restrictions on public gatherings, travel and working from home are other measures under close examination. It came as new modelling from the University of Southampton showed that coronavirus could have infected 7.6 million people in China alone, had the country not gone into lockdown.Researchers calculated that the estimated number of cases - 114,325 by February 29 - would have risen 67 fold, had draconian measures not been enacted to shut down transport systems, cut off cities, restrict social contact and quickly isolate suspected patients.Major provider LV on Wednesday stopped offering travel insurance, with warnings in the USA that the crisis could become Donald Trump’s Hurricane Katrina. In Germany Angela Merkel warned 70 per cent of the country -more than 50 million people could get the disease.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/09/12/coal-fired-power-plant.jpg","title":"coal plant investment electricity renewable energy cost difference","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘Proposed coal investments risk becoming stranded assets which could lock in high-cost coal power for decades,’ says\u0026nbspthink tank\u0026nbspbossCoal\u0026nbsppower developers risk wasting hundreds of billions of pounds as new renewables are now cheaper than new coal plants, a report has warned.In all major markets from the US to Europe, China, India and Australia, it already costs less to generate power from installing new wind or solar farms than new coal plants, the latest study from think tank Carbon Tracker found.By 2030, it could be cheaper to generate electricity by building new renewable facilities than to run existing coal-fired power stations – in all markets, the researchers predict.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAlready, four-fifths (82 per cent) of the UK’s remaining 12 gigawatts of operating coal power costs more than new renewables, Carbon Tracker said.In the UK, a cost on carbon pollution called the\u0026nbspcarbon price floor, along with falling demand and subsidies for renewables, has\u0026nbsphelped push most coal off the system ahead of a phase-out date which was recently moved forward to October 2024.Carbon emissions falling at fastest rate in 30 yearsUK’s largest coal power station to stop burning coal next yearEveryday domestic fuels to be phased out to combat air pollutionThe farmers switching to renewable energy over Brexit uncertaintyAcross the world, some 60 per cent of coal plants are generating electricity at a higher cost than the cost of power produced from building and running new renewable schemes, the think tank report\u0026nbspsaid.Carbon Tracker is urging governments and investors to cancel the vast amount of coal projects announced, permitted or under construction around the world – or waste $638bn\u0026nbsp(£495bn) in capital investment.Matt Gray, Carbon Tracker co-head of power and utilities and co-author of the report, said: “Renewables are out-competing coal around the world and proposed coal investments risk becoming stranded assets which could lock in high-cost coal power for decades.“The market is driving the low-carbon energy transition, but governments aren’t listening.“It makes economic sense for governments to cancel new coal projects immediately and progressively phase out existing plants.”Limiting global warming to 1.5C, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, means global coal use to generate electricity will have to fall by 80 per cent from 2010 to 2030 – and effectively one coal plant has to retire every day until 2040, the report said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The\u0026nbspdigital services tax of 2 per cent on large technology companies\u0027 revenues\u0026nbspis designed to stop the Exchequer missing out on profits shifted into tax havens. It\u0027s expected to raise £440m a year.Arun Birla, a partner at law firm\u0026nbspPaul Hastings warned that implementing the tax will not be easy. Whilst Spain and Italy are following suit, implementing their own unilateral taxes, what is really needed is a multijurisdictional approach that encompasses all nations, preventing them from implementing multiple versions of what is fundamentally the same legislation, he said.\u0026nbspThat said, setting up a global policy is no mean feat, and will only be achieved if all countries have the desire to do so.”Entrepreneurs relief, a tax break for business owners that costs £2bn a year,\u0026nbspwill be substantially reduced.\u0026nbspThe government will cut the total amount of relief an inidual can claim over their lifetime from £10m to £1m, saving around £6bn\u0026nbspfor the public purse over this parliament.\u0026nbspLess than one in ten claimants say\u0026nbspthe relief was an incentive to set up their business, and it is unfair, with three quarters of the cost going to just 5,000 iniduals, Mr\u0026nbspSunak said.There was bad news for the economy, however,\u0026nbspas the OBR again cut its forecast for growth and\u0026nbspproductivity.The chancellor forecasts the UK economy will grow 1.1 per cent this year, before taking into account any hit from coronavirus. That\u0027s down from 1.4 per cent predicted by the OBR in March last year.The downgrade\u0026nbspcame after official figures released on Wednesday morning showed the economy did not grow at all in January, dashing Conservative hopes of a post-election bounce.\u0026nbspTom Leman, head of retail and consumer at law firm Pinsent Masons,\u0026nbspsaid: “The abolition of business rates for small to medium-sized retailers and restaurants will be extremely welcome news.On the basis the coronavirus is not a long term issue for these businesses it is crucial that they have the liquidity to see them through the worst.This will definitely help the cause and hopefully see many of them come out the other side ready to benefit from the increased spending power prompted by the money people are currently saving on their discretionary spend.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The\u0026nbspdigital services tax of 2 per cent on large technology companies\u0027 revenues\u0026nbspis designed to stop the Exchequer missing out on profits shifted into tax havens. It\u0027s expected to raise £440m a year.Arun Birla, a partner at law firm\u0026nbspPaul Hastings warned that implementing the tax will not be easy. Whilst Spain and Italy are following suit, implementing their own unilateral taxes, what is really needed is a multijurisdictional approach that encompasses all nations, preventing them from implementing multiple versions of what is fundamentally the same legislation, he said.\u0026nbspThat said, setting up a global policy is no mean feat, and will only be achieved if all countries have the desire to do so.”Entrepreneurs relief, a tax break for business owners that costs £2bn a year,\u0026nbspwill be substantially reduced.\u0026nbspThe government will cut the total amount of relief an inidual can claim over their lifetime from £10m to £1m, saving around £6bn\u0026nbspfor the public purse over this parliament.\u0026nbspLess than one in ten claimants say\u0026nbspthe relief was an incentive to set up their business, and it is unfair, with three quarters of the cost going to just 5,000 iniduals, Mr\u0026nbspSunak said.There was bad news for the economy, however,\u0026nbspas the OBR again cut its forecast for growth and\u0026nbspproductivity.The chancellor forecasts the UK economy will grow 1.1 per cent this year, before taking into account any hit from coronavirus. That\u0027s down from 1.4 per cent predicted by the OBR in March last year.The downgrade\u0026nbspcame after official figures released on Wednesday morning showed the economy did not grow at all in January, dashing Conservative hopes of a post-election bounce.\u0026nbspTom Leman, head of retail and consumer at law firm Pinsent Masons,\u0026nbspsaid: “The abolition of business rates for small to medium-sized retailers and restaurants will be extremely welcome news.On the basis the coronavirus is not a long term issue for these businesses it is crucial that they have the liquidity to see them through the worst.This will definitely help the cause and hopefully see many of them come out the other side ready to benefit from the increased spending power prompted by the money people are currently saving on their discretionary spend.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But, until now, it had remained only theoretical, and eluded anyone who tried to actually put it into action.Scientists now hope that the discovery can be used to more precisely build quantum computers, and could be used to shed light on some of the mysteries of quantum science.This discovery means that we now have a pathway to build quantum computers using single-atom spins without the need for any oscillating magnetic field for their operation, says the University of New South Wales\u0027\u0026nbspScientia\u0026nbspProfessor of Quantum Engineering Andrea\u0026nbspMorello.Moreover, we can use these nuclei as exquisitely precise sensors of electric and magnetic fields, or to answer fundamental questions in quantum science.At the moment, a nuclear spin of this kind is controlled with magnetic fields. But the ability to do so with electric fields has far-reaching consequences, the researchers said. Magnetic fields must be generated using large coils and high currents and need larger spaces the equipment needed to generate electric fields is much smaller and more controlled.Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is one of the most widespread techniques in modern physics, chemistry, and even medicine or mining, says Professor Morello. Doctors use it to see inside a patient\u0027s body in great detail while mining companies use it to analyse rock samples.This all works extremely well, but for certain applications, the need to use magnetic fields to control and detect the nuclei can be a disadvantage.Changing away from that technique is like the difference between moving a billiard ball by picking up and shaking the whole table around, said Professor Morello – it will move, but make a mess of the rest of the ball\u0027s place. The electric resonance can be used to push the ball exactly where it needs to be.The technique was first proposed by another researcher in 1961. But researchers stumbled back on it by accident, they said, after it had been left ignored for more than half a century because it had been too difficult to demonstrate in practice.Now the researchers hope to be able to use their new way of controlling atoms for a variety of different breakthroughs.This landmark result will open up a treasure trove of discoveries and applications, said Professor Morello.The system we created has enough complexity to study how the classical world we experience every day emerges from the quantum realm.

It had these weird eyes staring out looking to the sides. There’s nothing like this alive today.“It’s just incredible to uncover this new ecological niche we never even knew existed.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a Budget of a government that gets things done.”But Mr Corbyn dismissed the chancellor’s announcements as “smoke and mirrors” which left austerity “baked into our system”.He pointed to IFS analysis which suggested that an immediate £54bn boost to day-to-day spending on Whitehall departments outside health and social care would be needed simply to get Budgets back to 2010 levels.“The government’s boast of the biggest investment since the 1950s is frankly a sleight of hand,” said Mr Corbyn. “It’s in fact only the biggest since they began their slash-and-burn assault on our services, economic infrastructure and living standards in 2010.“Having ruthlessly forced down the living standards and life chances of millions of our people for a decade, the talk of levelling up is a cruel joke.”Care providers and think tanks described the lack of additional funding for social care in the chancellor’s Budget as “hugely disappointing”.Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt described it as a “glaring omission”, adding that there was a “desperate” need for a long-term social care plan.And the Trades Union Congress said that while the spending U-turn was “badly overdue”, the priority for investment should be to “repair the damage” of 10 years of austerity.“Helping working families and rebuilding public services must come first,” said Frances O’Grady, TUC\u0026nbspsecretary general. “And we need to see concrete action on the challenges of the future.“This means banning zero-hours contracts, sorting social care, ending the UK’s dire regional inequalities, setting out a credible plan to achieve net zero, and getting an EU trade deal that supports jobs and workers across the UK.”But the Confederation of British Industry praised the chancellor for heeding business calls for “decisive action on vital long-term issues” like infrastructure development and incentives to invest in research and development.Carolyn Fairbairn, the organisation’s director general, said: “Some gaps still need to be filled in around skills, energy efficiency and powering the UK’s low-carbon future but\u0026nbspoverall, today’s Budget is a powerful signal to firms at home and abroad that the UK can and will manage the immediate challenges and long-term opportunities in parallel.”\u0026nbspThe chancellor\u0026nbspadded: “We will get through this – together. The British people may be worried, but they are not daunted. We will protect our country and our people. We will rise to this challenge.”Office for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspInstitute for Fiscal Studies\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We expect this shortfall to be partly reversed as the specifics of the trading relationship are clarified, hence reducing uncertainty.\u0026nbspBut, working in the other direction, we expect the adverse effect of higher trade barriers to build through our five-year forecast period and beyond.Figures released by the Office for National Statistics this morning show that the economy has flat-lined, even before the effects of coronavirus bite.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

DNA results show that the hatchlings were, in fact, reproduced through parthenogenesis!Parthenogenesis is unusual, with the first cases recorded in 2006 in the UK at both London and Chester Zoo, according to Scientific American.The publication explained how it works, saying: In parthenogenesis, the mother\u0027s half-set of chromosomes doubles up to generate the full complement. Hence, the offspring derives all its genes from the mother, but they are not a duplicate of her genome.They reported that only 0.1 percent of all vertebrate are able to reproduce asexually.Komodo dragon attacks tourist in Indonesia national parkExplaining how parthenogenesis developed, the zoo wrote that the process developed in the wild due to their isolated nature.In the wild,\u0026nbspKomodo\u0026nbspdragons mainly live isolated and often become violent when approached, which has allowed these animals to evolve to reproduce both sexually and parthenogenetically.Announcing the news, the zoo playfully posted: Our Komodo Dragon hatchling DNA results are in!*Maury Voice* Kadal, you are NOT the father!Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Do it again,” the prime minister said, as he broke into a laugh.The pair then demonstrated an elbow bump greeting before leaving the stage.On Tuesday, Dutch health officials said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country had risen by 61 to 382, with four deaths reported.The mistake has shown the difficulty governments face with attempts to prevent outbreaks of the virus, formally known as Covid-19, which is believed to spread in a similar way to influenza.Last week, the World Health Organisation said it was understood that coronavirus spreads “via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick”.Health officials have advised people to wash their hands often with soap and water, avoid close contact with people who are unwell, and cover their mouth or nose with a tissue or sleeve when coughingsneezing to prevent the spread of the virus.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Slight fevers too.#To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive.#DONALD Trump took the unprecedented step to suspend ALL flights from nearly all of Europe to the US for next  days due to the coronavirus pandemic.In a drastic move, the United States will bar entry from  European countries, except the UK and Ireland, for a month # as cases in the US exceed , with at least  deaths.Trump made the announcement as he delivered a rare prime-time Oval Office address on the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday # amid fears it could kill as many five million Americans, according to WHO forecasts.The President said the European Union #failed to take the same precautions# as the US before announcing the travel restrictions # which will go into effect on Friday at am.He singled out the UK as an exemption to the ban # but there was confusion as a later statement from the Department of Homeland Security said only countries in the Shengen area of free movement would be barred, therefore meaning Ireland was also exempt.The DHS claried that the travel restrictions would not impose a total travel ban on all of Europe or all US citizens.Just those countries in the the Schengen zone # which includes  mainland European counties that abolished border control at their entry points # would be banned.THE NBA suspended their season #until further notice# after a player tested positive for the killer coronavirus.The leagues shocking move came after French Utah Jazz star Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-, which has killed at least  people in the US.Tests were carried out on players shortly before tip-off between the Utah Jazz and the Oklahoma City Thunder in Oklahoma City, which was eventually cancelled.Players from both teams are currently quarantined inside the Thunders Chesapeake Energy Arena as US cases of the killer virus top , as of March .Reports indicate athletes on the Cavaliers, Knicks, Celtics, Pistons  Raptorsare now being told to self-quarantine as they were the last five teams to take on the Jazz.The White House is reportedly considering declaring a national disaster as part of efforts to address the spread of the coronavirus. The move would unlock new funding streams, allow hourly workers to be paid sick leave, and extend tax-filing deadlines by three months.The president is due to deliver a prime-time address to the nation about the epidemic from the Oval Office at pm this evening.

What is wrong with the system Meanwhile the LA Times reports that his other aunt, Crystal Diuguid, even claimed to her therapist that Anthonys mum was beating him and locking him in a room with no bathroom or access to food.Horried, by what she had heard, the therapist called the child abuse hotline.But despite these countless interventions, Anthony was allegedly continually tortured and eventually killed by his mum and her partner, prosecutors claim.They intend to seek the death penaltythey are convicted.Both Barron and Leiva have pleaded not guilty, and Anthonys siblings have been removed from the home.The grand jury transcripts in the Avalos case were unsealed in December after The Times petitioned in court to obtain the records.The second little boy, Noah Cuatro, died in hospital in July last year, one day after his parents called emergency services from their home in Palmdale, LA, to claim theyd found him drowned in their apartment complex pool.However, authorities quickly treated the death as suspicious after medical staff spotted injuries on the little boy that were inconsistent with drowning.His parents, Jose Maria Cuatro Jr.,  and Elaine Juarez, , are now accused of torturing him for a period of four months leading up to this death.Prosecutors also claim there were signs he was sexually assaulted the same day he was found motionless in the pool.The pair were charged last month with one count of murder and torture, while Cuatro also faces an additional charge of assault on a child causing death and one count of sexual penetration of a child under the age of .Juarez also faces one count of child abuse under circumstances likely to cause death.According to the LA Times, Noah spent his few years of le between foster care and the custody of his parents and great-grandmother.Like Gabriel and Anthony, he too had been visited by the DCFS multiple times - with a case worker even going to a judge in May  to claim his le was at imminent risk. While the judge issued a court order to remove him, the DCFS reportedly never executed the order.Noah is said to have died two weeks after the DCFS updated the court in June and asked for a -day continuance to investigate further.Garrett Therolf, a former Los Angeles Times reporter and series producer, ultimately claimed in the documentary that more than  children in the LA County with at least some DCFS involvement in their lives have died of abuse and neglect since Gabriels  death.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Covid- crisis was born in Wuhan and raises red-flag warnings over the country’s future prosperity and stability.Coronavirus is no joke but I am glad to say the opportunity is all ours. It gives us cover to do things we might never have otherwise dared.New Chancellor Rishi Sunak will use his first Budget on Wednesday to seize that chance with both hands.“We go into this in a very strong position,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr. “We need to make sure we respond at scale to whatever scenario comes our way.”This will be no “safety first” Budget. The coronavirus health emergency provides an option to be bold.It unlocks the Treasury stranglehold on spending, borrowing, infrastructure and, crucially, tax reform.Cash will be unleashed first into the NHS, with food and medical supplies a priority for the sick and elderly, plus emergency welfare for those whose earnings suddenly dry up.But there will also be money for big projects — schools, roads and railways and, with another deluge of rain on its way, a welcome doubling of spending on flood defences to £.BILLION.There will be both tax cuts and rises, but plans for a hike in fuel duty will be ditched, I gather.“Our public finances are in good shape,” the Chancellor insists. “I will lay the foundations for future growth and prosperity, level up the country and spread opportunity.”In other words, what is good for Britain’s physical health is also good for economic well-being.The way the world does business changed abruptly when Beijing celebrated Chinese New Year by shutting down most of the country.Today the “workshop of the world” is silent — with alarming implications for a regime whose authority depends on feeding nearly a fth of the planet’s population.Global giants including Volkswagen and Mercedes in Germany, and Apple in the USA, whose vital supply lines have been severed, are weighing their options.Thanks to Donald Trump’s trade wars, they were already reassessing their reliance on cheap but now unreliable overseas labour. The revival of “Rust Belt” cities and recruitment of local workers back home will accelerate.Others with no interest in capitalism are also finding opportunities.We may look back on those “before and after” satellite images of noxious nitrogen- dioxide clouds over China, and the clear blue skies today, as a turning point.Extinction Rebellion protesters might start digging up turf outside the Chinese Embassy, instead of vandalising Cambridge University.We will also notice a drop in air pollution after the collapse of shipping and plane travel.Ships carry  per cent of world trade but burn the heaviest oil, from the dirtiest dregs of a barrel of crude.Greta Thunberg and her “climate emergency” apostles will pounce on this evidence that we can live on fresh air.More seriously, we may be witnessing the end of globalisation — the spread of interlocking world trade which has raised living standards and spread prosperity for millions.It leaves Britain with the opportunity to pick up some of the slack.Ministers are already encouraging firms to raise productivity by swapping cheap migrant labour for expensive but efficient robot technology.The crisis will also have an impact on negotiations with the European Union.Britain is well placed, as a nimble sovereign nation with its own floating currency, to take advantage of fast-moving developments.We have low inflation, low unemployment, a near-record number in work and strong public finances.For the European Union, with its straitjacket single currency and paralysing regulation, the coronavirus crisis has no upside.Hundreds of firms and zombie banks are near collapse — including German giant Deutsche Bank. A downturn will hit firms and raise unemployment, already double the UK rate.EU negotiator Michel Barnier will soon have to choose — between the danger of a No Deal Brexit in December and the opportunity of a Canada-style arrangement which benefits all sides.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We had another who actually had both legs from his left side amputated.“They’ll usually start with the legs because it doesn’t kill the dog, so it means that the adrenaline is pumping around the dogs system.“They believe that the longer they can keep the dog alive while they’re preparing the meat, the better it will be for them.”The charity has rescued , dogs since it was set up in , but millions more have ended up being maimed and slaughtered in an industry estimated to be worth over £m worldwide.Emily, who usually lives in the north east province of Harbin but is back in Devon because of the coronavirus outbreak, tells Sun Online: “Knowing that humans are capable of that is probably the hardest part.”Every June, in the south east city of Yulin, thousands of dogs are slaughtered, butchered, cooked and eaten for the ten-day Lychee and Dog Meat Festival, where some believe the fruit and meat combination will bring health through the long winter months.Footage from last year’s event, which showed a dog being blowtorched alive, caused outrage around the world.But the thousands slaughtered at Yulin are just a drop in the ocean for a legal trade that sees million dogs slaughtered worldwide annually.Although it’s not part of the mainstream Chinese diet, China is the worlds largest dog meat market, with , tonnes produced each year. A recent pork shortage sent the price sky high and boosted sales of dog products.Despite producers claiming the meat comes from legal ‘dog meat farms’, the lucrative trade has also led to an epidemic of dog thefts from pet owners, with one study finding that  per cent of households in one village lost a dog in the last few years.Gangs of dog thieves capture strays and pets, sometimes through the use of anaesthetic-tipped needles shot from blow pipes or crossbows.Dogs are typically bludgeoned to death in front of each other, put into a de-hairing machine to remove fur, and then blowtorched for sale to markets.“I went to many slaughterhouses where we saw collars,” says Peter Li, Associate Professor of East Asian Politics at the University of Houston-Downtown. “Some dogs even had a jacket on.“I witnessed the dogs waiting to be slaughtered, they were trembling and huddling with each other.They slaughtered all the dogs in the morning but they’d left  dogs for the next day. All these twelve dogs stood in a pool of blood.In December , Chinese police in Anhui province arrested a gang that sold nearly , poisonous syringes to dog thieves.In the same month, a court in Fujian province sentenced a dog thief in a rural village to death for trying to shoot a dog with a poisoned dart but accidentally killing a pregnant woman.Meanwhile, last May a gang of  people in Jiangsu province were sentenced to between one and six years in prison for poisoning and stealing dogs, then selling more than ,kg of dog meat worth , yuan .Food safety laws are often broken by the dog traders, who smuggle the animals across borders without legitimate paperwork.But this gives activists a chance to intervene, by stopping cramped trucks in quiet country lanes and reporting them.“They’ll call the local authorities because they know these dogs shouldn’t be on the trucks - they’re being illegally transported,” says Emily.“There are so many local activists, they’ll actually try to barricade the trucks to allow them to have that time for the local authorities [to arrive].“Then the dogs get handed over to organisations such as ourselves.”After being checked for disease, and given vaccination jabs, the dogs are taken into the Harbin shelter before being re-homed around the world.“With a lot of them, we need to spend a lot of time behaviourally just to build up trust,” says Emily.Emily - who founded the Harbin SHS centre with fellow dog lovers Aimee Clark and Hayley Hayes - originally went to China to travel and teach but, missing her family dog, she volunteered at a the only dog home in the area.I didnt know anything about the dog meat trade and it was a massive eye opener, she said.I didnt know that anything like that existed over there. You cant really close your eyes once you know that thats going on. Then I met the other two girls, and they were very similar in their mindset.Hayley initially found five dogs that needed help and the three girls decided to set up a rescue home.We started with these five dogs. And then it went from five dogs to , then  and , and it just built from there.Despite the booming trade, there are an increasing number of pet lovers in China as well as growing opposition to the slaughter of dogs.“Animal lovers are winning the debate,” says Peter Li. “The other side are absolutely on the defensive.”In , the Humane Society Internationalhanded over a letter signed by .million people calling for an end to the annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival, supported by  Chinese animal protection groups.Clare Bass, UK Director of HSI, said: “Contrary to the assumptions by many in the West, most people in China don’t eat dogs and in fact they are horried at the thought of a trade that takes their canine companions away from them.”As the coronavirus outbreak saw the Chinese government introducing laws banning the sale and consumption of wild animals, one South China city, Shenzhen, also drafted legislation which explicitly bans eating dog meat.It is still not illegal to kill and eat dogs in the UK and campaign groups claim the lack of a ban sets a bad example to other countries where the practice is more common.Giles Watling, MP for Clacton, agrees the law should change here.“Because we’re a world leader in animal welfare, we need to wave the flag to the rest of the world,” he says.“What we can do is pass a law that outlaws the consumption of dog and cat meat. It’s not for us to dictate to other cultures what they should or should not eat, but it’s for us to say: ‘this is what we do,you like it, follow us’.”For Emily, the hard work continues but it does have its rewards.The yearly bill, supported by donations, is more than £, and Emily estimates she’s spent around £, of her own money on the rescue effort.“I wouldn’t change it for a thing, at all, they’re worth everything, she says.When see the happy ever afters, the dogs with the final families and living the lives that they deserve to live, that feels feels pretty good. You can follow Slaughterhouse Survivors on Instagram at https:www.instagram slaughterhouse_survivors Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the happiest day collectively I remember experiencing in the UK since the  London Olympics.We backed Prince Harry in his ious good causes like the Invictus Games.And we saluted the daring approach Meghan was making to modernising the Royal Family. I welcomed her approach and had much excitement that she could finish what Princess Diana had started.But there was criticism too. And aside from the vile trolls in that cesspit otherwise known as social media, most of it was fair and balanced.Like, for example, the couple preaching about our carbon footprints and the need to change our behaviour, while taking four private jet flights in  days.They may not have liked it, but they clearly thought about those objections because the couple now claim they will do what they can to fly commercially.There were many objections from within the Royal Family about the couple’s behaviour and demands – and there are two sides to this story.Many courtiers will tell you Harry and Meghan were rude and didn’t respect the hierarchy and pecking order that’s essential for smooth royal operations.But those close to Harry and Meghan have a very dferent perspective. They’ve told me that the couple felt they were under attack by royal staff members and other households from day one.We worried about the obvious changes to Harry, who went from happy go lucky to angry and brittle.We also questioned why so many of Meghan’s old friends and family members – including her own father Thomas – were no longer in her le.From a personal perspective, I value my school friends and blood relatives more than anyone  because they’ve known me for so long and know how to bring me down to earth whenever that might be required.But those small criticisms pale into insignicance when you compare the column inches and media coverage devoted to the issues that Harry and Meghan care about.Watching Meghan on stage at Robert Clack School in Dagenham working the crowd of teenagers like a true Hollywood princess, it’s very obvious the Royal Family are about to lose a superstar – and no one is celebrating that.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I see this for myself in my home town of Margate, where the rows of boarded up shops in the centre create a mood of permanent despair.In fact, for all the recent talk of regeneration in the Kent coastal town, it remains in the top one per cent of most deprived neighbourhoods in England.In the wake of Coronavirus, the Chancellor this week must take steps to ensure that businesses can stillthrough the crisis.Among the measures he should consider is a temporary suspension in VAT or employers’ national insurance so firms don’t suddenly run out of cash.He might also introduce a scheme whereby tax payments could be spread out over a longer period.Butthe roots of a retail revival are to go deeper, then the Conservative government will have to embark on genuine reform of business rates, which are currently penalising too many retailers.“Business rates are having a catastrophic effect on the high street. The system we have got at the moment is absolute lunacy,” says Tony Brown, the former chief executive of the retail chain Beales, which is now being closed with the loss of , jobs.As Mr Brown points out, in some cases the rates bill for a Beales store was  times as much as the rent, an unsustainable position.In this second decade of the st century, the Government is meant to be encouraging enterprise, but this mismanaged, unjust system does the exact opposite.As the commercial equivalent of the council tax, the unorm business rate — which is set by central government but collected by local authorities — is a levy paid by companies, supposedly based on the notional rental value of the premises they occupy.But it has become badly distorted by continual tinkering and changes in retail practices.Ministers still like it because it brings in a large amount of revenue, over £billion-a-year, and it is dficult to avoid.But it is riddled with absurdities and inconsistencies.For a start, it bears no relationship to how a retail business is performing.As John Webber, head of ratings at Colliers International global estate services company, puts it, “retailers are paying a disproportionate slice of UK business rate bills, and this burden is based purely on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing.”In addition, it is a tax that punishes high street firms while favouring cyberspace and out-of-town operators with far cheaper premises.In a justiably angry recent outburst, James Daunt, the head of the Watersones book chain, complained that the business rates system is “hollowing out the high street” and shting work “to God-awful warehouses.In a classic example of this destructive bias, the business rates bill for Amazon in  was just £.million, despite UK sales of nearly £.billion.Yet the fashion chain Next, with  stores, had to pay a business rates bill almost £million more than Amazon.The trouble doesnt end there.Businesses with a property of a rateable value of less than £, are eligible for  per cent tax relief, whereas stores with a property value of over £, get no relief at all.In addition, firms can be hurt by transitional relief, which is meant to act like a shock-absorber in gradually phasing in changes in the size of tax bills after any revaluation of properties.Transitional relief might be beneficial when rental values are rising because it gives business ratepayers several years to adjust to increases.But since the last valuation in , retail firms increasingly inhabit a world where commercial rents are falling.Because transitional relief also slows down reductions in bills, this means that many businesses are now paying far more than they really should, given the lower values of their properties.In one branch of Poundland in Blackpool, for example, the business rate should have fallen by  per cent between  and  because of the drop in rental values.Instead, misnamed transitional relief means that by  it will have gone down in real terms by only  per cent.“Transitional relief  I call it comic relief. It needs to be scrapped,” says Poundland’s boss Barry Williams.The Government has tinkered with business rates for years, but all this has achieved is more frustration and complexity.Real reform is needed so that the spirit of enterprise is rewarded rather than punished.Buoyed by their recent election result, the Tories talk about “levelling up the economy” through major infrastructure projects and new transport links.Butthey really want to make an immediate dference, they will focus on helping our high streets.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On housing we have taken a step back, generationally.Whereas my family could be certain of a secure home with a rent we could afford, too many young people today will never know what a stable foundation like that can do for them.A proper home lets people get on with their lives, get their children into a good school, start a business, get involved in the community.These are great British traits that the Conservative Party should be fighting for every day. After all, we created Right To Buy, which has been a great source of stability and mobility for millions, and a triumph of Tory values.However, we now need to reorient the policy so the great opportunities we continue to offer to people with Right To Buy are more than matched by building new social housing to replace what we sell.This is importantwe want to give more people the same chance I had. Shelter recently found there was a net loss of , council houses last year as a result of demolitions and properties sold off through Right To Buy.This is happening while thousands of hard-working families sit on social housing waiting lists, desperate for a shot at the stability they cannot find anywhere .Runaway house prices mean owning your own home has become a distant dream for many lower-paid workers — receptionists, hospital porters, teaching assistants.These hard-working people still deserve a secure home. In the past  years alone house prices in England have grown at twice the pace of wages.The average home increased in value by  per cent between  and , while wages only grew by  per cent.Investing in social housing should be a deeply Conservative ideal. It gives people a  on which to build their lives, to progress and to grow. It is an essential element of a society that values social mobility.After all, it was a Conservative-led council in Liverpool that built the first ever council house as far back as .At last year’s General Election, people up and down the country, many from poorer backgrounds and living in social housing, put their trust in the Conservative Party to deliver for them.If our policies simply continue to provide only expensive new-builds for the already well-off, and almost unaffordable rents for the rest, then people might be left wonderingthat trust was misplaced.By building up our nation’s social housing and ensuring there is sufficient stock of affordable homes, we can give people a chance of a good home and deliver on our promises of fairness and aspiration.There is a world of dference between my childhood home and the grim high-rises that have come to define social housing for many today.But done right, new social housing can create thriving community hubs, minimise crime and be as appealing as new garden villages and towns. You need only to look at Goldsmith Street, the award-winning new development in Norwich, to know this vision is achievable.But warm words alone won’t build good-quality, affordable homes. We need money to build, and the Budget is a chance to signal the party is serious about tackling housing inequality head on.I’ve led a group of  fellow Conservative MPs from across the country and one Conservative metro mayor to call on the Chancellor to let our voters know whose side we are on. We have sent him a letter, an edited version of which is above.Many of us have felt the benefits of social housing in our own lives and we want the next generation to have the same shot at success we did. I hope our new Chancellor listens to our call in his Budget.A secure home lets people get on with their lives, look after their families and grow their businesses without having to worry about damp and draughts damaging their children’s health or a sudden hike in rent ending their dreams.Ensuring this means building up our nation’s offer of social homes. This has been ignored for too many decades. If our policies simply continue to provide only unaffordable housing, the people will never forgive us.However,we are the party that finally delivers the social and other high-quality affordable housing this country needs, they will never forget us.We need the money to build and renovate our available stock, and reform of the planning and laws around land to make it easier to get the social homes built.We believe this year’s Budget is the chance to signal that we will be serious about making this happen.Yours sincerely, DavidOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s been under Aprican rule ever since.”Immediate consequences seem to be a dramatic improvement in the weather, everyone in London is now dressed like Graham Norton and there’s a ban on black people and white people holding hands on buses.Love can breach the racial ide, though. Callum, a white nought, played by Jack Rowan, has fallen for Masali Baduza’s Sephy, the black daughter of the Home Secretary.This all plays well, obviously, to the self-loathing Empire guilt of the BBC and a lot of middle-class newspapers, who’ve described it as “timely”, “vital” and even claimed: “Noughts + Crosses’ world is our world.”I don’t know what part of Britain they live in where black and white people are banned from holding hands on buses but, lets set aside the show’s political agenda for a moment.The thing about Noughts + Crosses is that, for both technical and artistic reasons, it doesn’t work particularly well as a drama.The story is, of course, as solid as the day William Shakespeare wrote Romeo  Juliet, but the visual problems start with the fact that, because it was filmed in Cape Town, there appears to be a dirty great mountain hovering above what I think is meant to be Tilbury.The obvious climate issue also means poor Helen Baxendale, who plays Callum’s servant mum Maggie, is left with the gear change when she suddenly has to hold up her boss’s dress and say: “Beautul isn’t it . . . and so is the weather.”“Yes, finally some sunshine, You might even catch some colour.”Ker-unch. I’m also not buying the central relationship between Sephy and Callum, which is marked by a distinct lack of sexual chemistry, or the idea he qualied for the elite military school after one weekend on an assault course.The real issue you cannot ignore, however, is the political baggage. If Noughts + Crosses had been screened  or even  years ago, it would’ve been sensational.In , though, TV is overwhelmed by shows and voices telling us everything is racist and sexist, so it just felt and looked like the slowest-moving episode of Doctor Who ever.I find it particularly galling that a lot of those siren voices belong to journalists who I know will be out of a job the day they stop pretending modern-day Britain is really no dferent from Third Reich Germany in .It shouldn’t blind us to our own country’s faults, though.I can, for instance, think of a very prominent British institution that’s had nothing but white, male Director Generals since it was created in .The BBC, though, has always been better at pointing the finger at others rather than itself.So until such time as TV realises less is more, I fully expect Noughts + Crosses to be given awards, acclaim and further series, while a great chunk of television’s weary audience shrugs: “Yeah, everything is racist. We know.”THE heart now sinks every time the lt doors open at The Sex Clinic, on E, and out pops another human horror story like “fabulous fairy” Hugo.His description, not mine. And based on what  I’ve absolutely no idea.But apparently Hugo can have anything up to “three or four men a day”, while he describes his sex le as “very fast-forward”.So I took the hint and skipped through his bits at x speed.The trouble with The Sex Clinic, though, is there’s no light at the end of the tunnel – just more patients like free-wheeling Esther, from Wigan, who shocked me to the core by announcing: “I do not want to jump from d**k to d**k like Tarzan.”’Cos I’d no idea Tarzan was even gay.Although it’s Jane I actually feel sorry for, obviously.Beth England: “Getting on flights brought me back down to earth.”GOOD Morning Britain “megafauna” Piers Morgan: “A lot of people say I look like a young Roger Moore.”BBC continuity: “Now you’re in for a treat.

We’ve been there it is really terrible, have you heard something about it  Interesting.Harry replied: “I actually haven’t because I don’t really look at news anymore. That starts my day badly and finishes my day badly.”He added: “I think it’s a very good idea.”Harry was also pranked into promising to help move penguins to the North Pole.The jokers even told the Duke they could help him claim the throne of Russia and suggested Greta could marry Prince George.They also joked about Harry smoking “weed” with hippies on her eco-catamaran and proposed he join Greta’s celebrity movement called “Stars Save The Earth” with Leonardo Di Caprio and Angelina Jolie.In an embarrassing exchange Harry failed to spot the pranksters wanted a ship to sail penguins - which are native to the South Pole - all the way to the North Pole.The fake Greta and her dad Svante said they had  penguins stuck in land-locked Belarus where it was only a “barbaric” - degrees instead of -.Greta said: “Yeah and now we are searching for some ship maybe to transport the poor penguins to their native place.”Her father added: “North Pole.

He is from Norway, called Ingus Sorhein, he may able to help you, he knows all the right people.”Greta also asked Harryhe could help her marry into the British royal family suggesting she is interested in Prince George, claiming she a distant relative of Sweden’s King Charles.Harry replied: “I can assure you, marrying a Prince or Princess is not all it’s made up to be.”And she claimed there were discussions in Russia that Harry could become the head of a restored monarchy.Harry replied chuckling: “Well there you go maybe that’s our new purpose to be able to focus and take over Russia.”Greta offered Harry a ride on her zero-carbon catamaran with her “hippy friends” she used to traverse the Atlantic to avoid gas-guzzling jets.Her fake dad said: “But I want to warn you, these people have been smoking weed in the sea all the time.”Harry replied: “I’m sure”And the would-be Greta said: “I read Harry also smoked when he was young.

Yup, a decade of austerity is well and truly over.His £ billion three point plan to deal with the coronavirus epidemic made it clear the situation is being taken extremely seriously by this government, regardless of what the fake news on social media suggests – and when it comes to the NHS, money is going to be no object. That’s what we want and need to hear right now.Sunak committed a billion pounds for the financial security of vulnerable members of the public during the emergency as he tries to rebrand the Tories as the “real party for the workers”.And he took the “signicant step” of providing statutory sick pay paid for by the government for small businesses for those off work for up to  days.No one was left out of his plans to cut business rates to zero to deal with the crisis – with everything from music venues to hotels covered. And the small businesses most in need will receive an extra £, cash injection.This was a package to save our economy in the short term. It’s hard to argue with the chancellor when he says it’s one of the most comprehensive fiscal stimulus packages anywhere in the world.But what about the psychological impact of financial stress on iniduals  I’m delighted he has also asked the HMRC to delay payments over time for those struggling in the wake of this very unexpected crisis.As for the Tories plans to level up, there was a spending spree too.The continued freeze on fuel duty – a campaign led by The Sun for the past decade that I have taken up on my talkRADIO show too – was a welcome dose of common sense that will help iniduals, businesses and public services.A freeze on alcohol duty should be celebrated too, as should the abolishment of the hated tampon tax.But much more signicant was Sunak’s vow to “unleash the power of business”, with support for new bold ideas – a Dominic Cummings’ passion project – given special funding.And the infrastructure spend is incredibly signicant too with Sunak’s vow: “If the country needs it we will build it.”From  million potholes being filled to transforming transport systems north of Newcastle, critics will find it hard to say Sunak didn’t do enough. Although that’s predictably how Labour immediately responded.But this will go down as the coronavirus budget.And perhaps the most important factor is that I believed Mr Sunak when he said the government will do whatever it takes to protect our country and our most vulnerable people during what is going to be a very rough few weeks and months ahead.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or fully grown adults wearing replica football shirts  Or better still, bottled water — the real environmental scandal of our time.But cigarettes aside, Rishi Sunak’s first Budget as Chancellor ticked all the right boxes.In parts, quite a lot of parts, it sounded like a moderate Labour Budget.By which I don’t mean the kind of thing the wretched John McDonnell might have delivered — free unicorns for the poor and all people who earn money to be shot etc.I mean the Labour Party when it had an ounce of common sense.There was good populist stuff in there, especially the pledge to mend the potholes.I can’t be the only bloke who has had to fork out for a new tyre because of a hole in the road the size of the Isle of Wight.A lot of the Budget was, reasonably enough, directed at battling coronavirus.Help for businesses and sick pay for those who miss work and wouldn’t normally get it. And pretty much a blank cheque for the NHS.All of this was necessary, but it meant that much of the good stuff in the Budget got overlooked a little.This Government was brought to power by the votes of former Labour supporters in the North andthe North East.Parts of the country which, in the past, Conservative governments have left to rot.It took a lot to get those people to vote Tory — and they won’t do it againthere isn’t substantial investment in infra-structure for our northern towns and cities.The Chancellor addressed this. He announced a massive increase in capital spending.Some £billion will be spent investing in infrastructure.That’s the highest level in real terms since Clement Attlee’s excellent Labour government  years ago.We don’t know where it’s all going yet.If it gets swallowed up by the largely daft HS rail scheme, that will be a mistake.Sunak, though, knows the North East. He knows we need big investment to make these places attractive to business and to those who might move there.He knows too that we need to disperse high-paying jobs to the regions.So there’s going to be a new economic campus in the North and , civil service jobs moved from the capital to the regions.Excellent. This is what Boris Johnson means by “levelling up”.For too long London and the rest of the UK have been effectively two separate countries.So, the cigarettes apart, this was a fine Budget which should reassure those new Conservative voters that this government WILL look after their interests.And the latest opinion polls  Tories on  per cent.Labour way down on even its pathetic election share.So far, Boris and Rishi have not put a foot wrong.But here in the North we’re still watching, gentle-men.

You can’t be too careful.I suppose I also understand people buying hand sanitiser – asit had suddenly occurred to them that having clean hands might be a good idea.But what’s with the toilet paper  Is that really your first thought at a time of crisis  And the amount of the stuff people are buying!Lordy,that’s how many rolls they need, I think Covid- is the least of their worries.It’ll be the same when Armageddon comes, when the nukes are flying hither and thither.All the supermarkets will be stripped of vanilla-scented soft ply.“If I’m going to meet my maker, I will do so with a very clean arse.”They usually keep a bucket, or something, of the stuff outside the front door. It’s blessed by the monks, I think.Anyway they’ve discontinued the practice for a while to prevent the spread of this singularly annoying virus.And people are saying – well,it’s holy, it can’t possibly be tainted with flu virus, can it There’s one born every minute, isn’t there THE Labour Party is continuing its long and exciting journey from being a government in waiting to being a small organisation for the terminally deranged.Their latest act has been to suspend the last remaining sane member of the party, the excellent Trevor Phillips.He’s a lelong campaigner against racism – but has been suspended for being Islamophobic.He has never been remotely Islamophobic.If Phillips had been leading the Labour Party at the last election, we’d probably have a Labour government now.Instead, it was led by a rabble of anti-Semitic, far-left loons obsessed with identity politics and Palestine.I’M still not sure we’re doing the proper coronavirus checks on people flying back from their bloody skiing holidays in Italy.There are reports of many passengers receiving no checks at all.Surely anyone who has been to Italy should have been advised long ago to self-isolate – and inform the authoritiesthey feel poorly.I think we will regret not having done this.Well done British Airways for cancelling all flights to Italy.

Our economy, firms and workers need a short-term bailout to survive it.Brexit may entail another brief rocky patch which needs further stimulus.And the Tories also have to fulfil on their long-term mission, Boris Johnson’s revolutionary aim to spread ­London’s opportunities out to the regions.All that — “security today, prosperity tomorrow”, Mr Sunak called it — will cost hundreds of billions which, without raising taxes yet further, he must borrow.But there has never been a better time, with interest rates rooted to the floor.And we would trust a Tory Chancellor to do so more than any hard-left Labour regime hostile to capitalism itself.Britain seems to agree. The re-elected Tories are at  per cent in polls — but most of their voters do want far more spent on our threadbare public services.There were several standout ideas as Mr Sunak delivered his first Budget with remarkable poise and passion for a man less than a month into his job.The £billion to mitigate the Covid- pandemic should be an immense relief to small firms and workers, especially the year-long rates holiday and newly relaxed sick pay rules.And whatever the NHS needs it will get, the Chancellor said, starting with a £billion emergency fund.“It will be tough, but we will recover,” he added.It was stark, but reassuring.Then came tax cuts and freezes galore, music to the ears of working people.A National Insurance threshold rise worth £, the tampon tax axed, duties frozen on booze and fuel, a ­victory for The Sun.The planned infrastructure spend is vast: £billion over five years including £billion on roads, new rail ­stations, £billion on affordable social housing and £billion to remove Grenfell-style cladding from all high-rises.New roads and cheaper petrol won’t please eco campaigners, but there was also major investment in electric vehicle grants and charging, a plastic packaging tax and a big tree-planting programme.Labour might have had the wit to respond by saying Mr Sunak had simply stolen their clothes. Instead Corbyn droned idiotically on about austerity as his backbenchers prayed for the end.We wonder what ground his successor can fight on, with the Tories launching the biggest spending spree in  years.Yes, there is a risk it will end in tears. But few can argue it isn’t vital for Britain’s health — physically and economically. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tory finance chief turned the spending taps to ‘gushing’ as he laid out what experts called the biggest giveaway Budget since . There are some restrictions on entrepreneurs and a tax hike on EU nationals.But mostly it’ll be funded by an explosion in borrowing - the exact thing the Tories slammed Labour for doing during the  financial crisis.With all those big picture measures, and the fear of the COVID- virus, it’s easy to miss the small print of the -page Budget document and how it will hit you. So as a public service we’ve gone through it with a fine-toothed comb - and picked out an awkward  things the Chancellor may well prefer you not to read. This first one is actually not from the government - it’s from their budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsiiblity. “Historically, the chance of the economy falling into recession at some point in a five-year period is roughly one-in-two,” they say. “But a recession this year is quite possiblethe spread of coronavirus causes widespread economic disruption.”  Unions sounded the alarm after the Budget was used to launch a review of the Retail Prices Indexmeasure of inflation. The government claims RPI has “shortcomings” in how it’s measured and has proposed aligning it with the lower CPIH rate after February . But the higher RPI is used to calculate many people’s pension payments and pay uprating, according to the GMB union. So removing it will mean a hit to future payments. GMB general secretary Tim Roache warned: “These proposals will be a hammer blow for millions of working people and pensioners. This might be presented as a technical issue butthis goes through it will end up costing millions of workers and pensioners their full, hard-earned compensation. . Millions of EU nationals will be whacked with a £ NHS charge - raking in £.billion  The Budget confirms the Immigration Health Surcharge for non-Brits using the NHS will explode from £ to £ per year. And crucially it will be extended to more than million EU nationals who live in the UK from  - even those who work in the NHS or pay taxes in this country. We knew this would happen from the Tory manesto. What’s new, however, is the sheer size of the tax grab from EU nationals. Overall the Treasury is planning to cream off £.bn in extra Immigration Health Surcharge over five years, from   to  . There will be a discounted rate for children, but it’ll still be £ per year. . Universal Credit may only be fully rolled out in   Again, this is from the OBR watchdog and not the government. But it’s important.Last month, the government admitted it had pushed back the rollout of Universal Credit again and it would only end in September .Yet it’s been delayed more than seven times. And now there have been so many delays, the OBR has decided to just assume it will only finish in September . “Our decision to erge more materially from DWP’s plans reflects both the accumulated experience of the past seven years,” the OBR said drily. “And the greater emphasis on taking things slowly to protect claimants.” . The poorest people will gain less than middle earners  A little-noticed ‘distributional analysis’ in the Budgetshows the poorest % of households will gain between £ and £ per year. But while nothing like the bad old austerity days, that’s still less than the benefit to nearly everyone . Only the top % are benefiting less. The analysis, produced by the Treasury, shows the impact of tax and benefit changes in   from both the  Spending Round and the  Budget. . Vulnerable families will face a £ ‘Boiler Tax’  Blink and you’d miss it, but the Chancellor briefly said “from April  I’m freezing the levy on electricity and raising it on gas.” Raising it on gas, eh  So what does that mean  The small print shows he was talking about a consultation on a Green Gas Levy, a tax on gas suppliers in order to fund the production of bio-methane. Treasury officials told The Times it would cost £ per household per year initially, rising to £ per year by . But the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health warned it was deeply worrying. Chief executive Anne Godfrey said: By freezing electricity costs and increasing the cost of gas, the Chancellor is effectively making energy more expensive for everyone. The plan to increase the levy on gas is deeply worrying and we urge the Government to clary their intentions and outline how they will support those living in fuel poverty. . There’s a massive percentage tax rise on rolling tobacco  Given how bad they are for us - and the NHS - you’d expect cigarettes to see a tax hike. But the duty on roll-ups, used by some of the most skint smokers, is rising by far more than that on ordinary cigarettes. For most tobacco products it’s RPI inflation plus % for hand-rolling tobacco it’s RPI plus %. . Tories have handed a £.bn tax break to £, earners  A reeeeeeally complicated pensions change will help the NHS - but at the cost of giving £, earners a tax break. Basically, doctors had warned they were refusing overtime shts because they were being pushed over into a dferent set of pension rules. The current system meanspeople earn £ over a £k threshold, they are classed under a completely new set of rules for calculating their income to decide what tax relief theyaposll get on their pension. The rules are pretty simplepeople are definitely in one system or the other. But because doctors’ average salary is £k they didn’t know which system they were in. Treasury officials were looking at raising the £, threshold to £,. Now they’ve gone even further and raised it to £, from next month. But the relief will apply to everyone, not just doctors. And the small print shows it will deprive the Treasury of £.bn over five years. . There’s no mention of where tampon tax funding will go  Since  the money raised by the hated % VAT charge on tampons and sanitary towels, which couldnapost be abolished while the UK was in the EU, has been used to fund a charity pot for womenaposs groups. Since its creation, £million has been awarded by the fund to projects that help disadvantaged and vulnerable women across the UK. But now the Budget makes no mention of where that money will go. Women’s Budget Group Director Mary-Ann Stephenson said: “We welcome the removal of the tampon tax, but the Chancellor said nothing about what would replace it as a source of funding for violence against women and girls services, which it is estimated need £ million a year.” . Brexit is taking a massive hit to the British economy  Boris Johnson ’s Brexit will slow down economic growth to the tune of £, for every person in the country, the government’s spending watchdog has said.Brexit appeared just twice in Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s first Budget speech despite the huge impact it’s predicted to have on the national finances. The Office for Budget Responsibilitysaid based on current Brexit plans, growth would be slowed by around % in the long run. They said part of the slowdown was a result of lower migration - but most was from a slump in business investment. The body - set up by George Osborne to scrutinise Budgets - said the economy had only seen a third of the impact of Brexit so far. Another third will happen over the next five years, and the remainder after . And... The Tories’ new immigration system will hurt economic growth The OBR watchdog also warns the Tories’ Brexit immigration system will take a hit to GDP. The salary cap of £, will leave GDP .% smaller than it would have been in  . In fairness, though, the OBR also says this wouldn’t be a signicant change compared to other factors, some of which also involve Brexit. . That £bn in infrastructure spending  Most of it was already announced  The Budget goes on about a £bn infrastructure fund which, by any stretch of the imagination, sounds very very impressive. But actually £bn was announced in the Tory manesto, and the £bn figure is a “gross” total. The actual figure is still big, but a lot less so.  . That £m for rough sleepers  £m of it was already announced Chancellor Rishi Sunak boasted of £million to tackle rough sleeping. But when you break it down, it’s not quite as impressive. £million of it for , rough sleepers’ accommodation was already announced previously by Boris Johnson. The further money is £m for “associated support services” abd £m for drug and alcohol abuse treatment. .

And while there was plenty of other important information being shared, people watching along at home couldnapost help but get a little distracted.Amid coronavirus panic, viewers found themselves unable to stop noticing whenever an MP coughed in the House of Commons, or touched their face - something weaposve all been advised not to do without washing our hands.Following this, a number of people took to social media to share shock at what theyaposd seen and it was an important reminder of how we all need to alter our behaviour for the sake of others during the outbreak.  Foreign Secretary and First Secretary of State Dominic Raab was a big talking point on Twitter , as he was seen repeatedly coughing into his hand - even though current NHS advice states you should cough into a tissue.One person said: The front bench are all touching their faces, Dominic Raab has a cough. Unbelievable. Another tweeted: Dominic Raab looking peaky and, unbelievably, coughing into his hand. He’s yet to discover that a tissue is a strategic way to capture and bin symptoms of a virus. A third wrote: Can someone please get Dominic Raab a large hanky to cough in. He is barely covering his mouth and coughing consistently on the front bench. These health concerns come after it was announced on Tuesday that an MP had tested positive for the coronavius.

The BBC bought the site in  so it could move operations away from Londonneeded. During the Cold War it was earmarked as a broadcasting centre in the event of a nuclear attack. Visitors to Wood Norton are now being limited to keep the facility clean and prevent the risk of it becoming infected, according to a source. London-based workers rely heavily on public transport, where the threat of contracting the disease is deemed greater. But Wood Norton has no public transport links, meaning it is easier to keep the site free of the virus. The source said staff already based at Wood Norton “have the skills and capacity to do what London control rooms do”.

Equally Brexit isn’t done when trade barriers with our European neighbours would require , form fillers and destroy productive jobs. Yet there is no doubt this Budget is a sht in gears by the Conservatives. Costing his emergency spending at £-billion, the Treasury cheque writer’s loosened his party’s -year self-defeating austerity obsession when borrowing must go up. An apology that didn’t work was noticeably missing, leech doctor bloodsucking deflating wages and growth while inflating national debt over the lost decade. Had the Tories applied a coronavirus-style financial blood transfusion after the banking collapse instead of raising VAT by a record £-billion and scything investment, we’d all be better off. The devil will be in the Treasury red book’s detail when the document’s dissected by independent number crunches. Labour’s dilemma is what does the current leadership welcome and what does it damn.

The Chancellor’s decision to splash the cash was forced in part by the coronavirus crisis.Yet his spree was also an acknowledgement Labour was right to argue you need investment to stimulate growth and protect jobs. We withhold judgement on whether his package of measures to help Britain weather the Covid- threat is sufficient. While support for staff and small firms is welcome there was not nearly enough to help the self-employed and gig economy workers.  It was also troubling that the Chancellor had nothing to say on social care, childcare or the funding crisis in local government.The extra investment in the NHS and further education was long overdue, as was the money to remove cladding from high-rise buildings. So many measures announced yesterday should and could have come years earlier. The Chancellor spoke of levelling up yet this remained a fundamentally Tory Budget in many respects. Even the Treasury’s own analysis showed the losers were the poorest %.  Mr Sunak has to deliver on his ambitious plans. Voters have heard talk of getting things done – now they want to see action that will improve communities, hospitals and schools. To listen to the Chancellor, you would not believe his party had been in power since . For all his emphasis on this being a Budget by a new government at the start of the new decade, he cannot wash his hands of responsibility for what happened in the past  years. This was a confident debut but the Chancellor yet he knows his plans could hit the rocks of coronavirus and Brexit.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced today that among the governmentaposs new measures there will be £million spent on repairing potholes, business rates discount to protect pubs, and beer, wine, cider and spirits duties will also be frozen. There will also be a % retail discount on business rates to protect hotels, pubs and guest houses. Minimum Income Floor in Universal Credit will also be temporarily removed but the government failed to announce measures that will directly tackle growing child poverty numbers. Alison Garnham, Chief Executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: When it comes to the nation’s longer-term priorities, action on poverty must trump potholes and pubs. We need to properly re-invest in our social infrastructure. Have you been affected by this story Email  webnews@mirror The temporary lting of the Minimum Income Floor in Universal Credit is very welcome, but to be effective, a plan for prosperity must include fixes to the fundamental design flaws and funding shortfalls that have left universal credit unfit for purpose. “Universal credit continues to cause havoc for millions so it is disappointing that the Chancellor brought no substantial permanent reforms to the table today. “It is within the Government’s power to spread opportunity more evenly across the UK and to enable struggling families to get on, but unless funding is restored for universal credit and for children’s benefits, investment in infrastructure will have limited effects. This Budget was an opportunity to begin to slow the rise in child poverty but there was no evidence today that low incomes are the priority that they should be in any effective strategy to level up the country and boost the economy. Since the Tories came to power in  child poverty has soared by more half a million from . million to . million. The Daily Mirror is calling on the government to raise child benefit by £ a week to end of child poverty. A £-a-week increase would mean families gain £ a year on average and lt , children out of poverty. In addition the benefit cap has left , single parents worse off as it limits the amount families can receive to £. a weekthey live in London and £. in the rest of the country.  Ms Garnham said: The Government could lt , children from poverty by it restored support for children in Universal Credit to its  value, added £ to child benefit and removed the two-child limit and benefit cap. That would begin to level up those children and to send a strong signal to struggling families that they have not been forgotten.” End Child Poverty, a coalition of more than  charities, Unions, faith groups, professional bodies and community groups is dismayed that the Chancellor has not done more to loosen the grip of poverty on . million children in the UK. Anna Feuchtwang, Chair of the End Child Poverty coalition and Chief Executive of the National Children’s Bureau said: We welcome the Chancellor’s actions on the benefits system to help the most vulnerable during the Coronavirus crisis.  * Read more about our  Give Me Five campaign However, low income families could be forgiven for thinking that they are simply not part of the Government’s long term plan for prosperity for this nation. This budget was an opportunity, with ambitious policymaking, to set a course of action to end child poverty. It is not right that growing up in poverty restricts and restrains children’s everyday lives and their futures. Their chances of prospering are unjustly much less that their peers. Yet this is the reality for . million children – the majority from working households. In addition to increases to the national living wage and reductions to National Insurance, working families need: benefits to keep pace with inflation and private rents an end to the five week wait for Universal Credit and an end to the two-child limit. And we are disappointed that there has been no increase in child benefit, which the Mirror has been campaigning for. Sadly, without an explicit commitment to end child poverty this isn’t a budget that will mean prosperity for all.  The Chancellor also said in response to the coronavirus crisis statutory sick pay will become available for any advised to self isolate - eventhey haven’t presented with symptoms. A move welcomed by Ms Garnham but she called for more support for people on Universal Credit who have been forced to self-isolate. “The new coronavirus emergency measures on Statutory Sickness Pay, employment support allowance and universal credit are welcome but low-income families need support in health and in sickness, she said. “It is critical that universal credit payments are made available immediately on a non-repayable basis to anyone self-isolating who needs to claim.” In Poplar and Limehouse % of children are living in poverty making the east London constituency the child poverty capital in the country.

Emma Revie, Chief Executive of the Trussell Trust, warned that Brits living in poverty face an “unprecedented challenge” as the COVID- outbreak leads to empty supermarkets and stockpiling.A spokesperson for the trust, which has  food banks in its network, told  Mirror  that while   food banks will continue to provide the leline of emergency food - “what this could look like in the coming weeks is hard for us to say at this stage”.  The stark warning came as the number of people in the UK to be diagnosed with the virus jumped up by  to  and some food banks started to run out of basics and are rationing out parcels. Ms Revie said it is possible that food banks will face increased demand at a time when donations may drop and volunteers become unavailable due to the strict rules that are being enforced to stop further spread of the virus. And she encouraged people to drop off vital items at their nearest food bank - after checking what is running low. She said: “Time and again over the past decade, food banks across the UK – aided by a generous public who have donated time, food and money – have stepped up to protect people on the lowest incomes in our communities. But with the spread of coronavirus we all now face an unprecedented challenge and uncertain future. It is possible that food banks will face increased demand as people lose income, at the same time as food donations drop or staff and volunteers are unavailable, due to measures rightly put in place to slow the spread of infection. All of this comes when food banks are already dealing with a record level of need for emergency food.”  The Trussell Trust charity handed out a record , three-day emergency food parcels in the six months to September - a % rise on the previous year. Low income was the primary reason for % of referrals followed by benefit delays , benefit changesand debt . Ms Revie added:“We’re working with our network on how best to support people as the situation unfolds.

The red tape around the door makes it crystal clear that this is a high contamination zone. I am in Flucamp, where  human guinea pigs will be willingly infected with a strain of coronavirus in the coming months. The Mirror has gained exclusive access to the facility, which could play a vital role in the fight against Covid- by helping create a vaccine or anti-viral drugs. Triallists can earn between £,-£,. Tens of thousands of volunteers have already applied. “This is a critical step to fast-track development of these anti-virals and vaccines,” explains Dr Andrew Catchpole, chief scientist at Hvivo which runs the facility. “We’re trying to use our expertise in this area to see what we can do.” Volunteers will not be infected with Covid-, but with “harmless” strains of the coronavirus – OC and E – which will cause a very mild respiratory illness. The aim is to safely expose them to “close relatives” of the deadly strain, helping pharmaceutical firms test potential vaccines. Dr Catchpole added: “If it can work on our virus, there’s no reason why it can’t work with Covid-.” Cathal Friel, executive chairman of Hvivo’s owner Open Orphan, added: “The company is starting the process of developing the world’s first coronavirus challenge study model – basically, we take a harmless version of the virus that we can use and monitor. “This is a British company which is the world centre for virology.” Hvivo, which has been running clinical trials on flu and cold viruses since , has seen an unprecedented , apply for coronavirus tests at its site in Whitechapel, East London.  But the odds of being suitable are -. Only  to -year-olds are even considered and smokers are immediately ruled out. Dr Catchpole said: “We want very healthy iniduals so we can be sure that the disease that’s given is controlled. Then they come in and have a blood sample. We’re testing for pre-existing immunity. We’ve all been exposed to family members of the coronavirus, we’ve all got some levels of immunity. “We need to screen people so we’re only giving the virus to those who would get sick. That can eliminate up to % of subjects.”For those who clear that hurdle, lungand livertests follow. Dr Catchpole said: “If you get through, participants would be invited back in for quarantine.” A month before quarantine begins, half of the group will be given a potential Covid- vaccine – currently in development by a third party. The other % will get a placebo. One month later, all are infected with a “lesser” virus via a nasal spray before being confined to one of the ft by ft rooms, only half of which have windows, for  days.Staff in blue scrubs, gloves and ventilators will come in several times a day to take nasal swabs and other routine tests. Gruesomely, the amount of mucus produced by participants is weighed daily. Dr Catchpole explained: “When you have a cold you need to blow your nose, it’s an effective measure of the level of symptoms someone has. “So we provide them with pre-weighed tissues so we know the weight of the tissue at the start and they have a sealed bag which they put used tissues in.” Meals will be delivered on a tray by staff wearing ventilators and other protective gear. Access to TV, games consoles, wi-fi, and a few home comforts help ease the boredom of two weeks’ solitary confinement. Site manager Laura Krizman said: “They’re encouraged to bring laptops, books, students bring projects. Some brought teddy bears, cuddly things.” All personal belongings are decontaminated at the end of the trial. Surprisingly given all that, ex-triallists have left rave reviews on Flucamp’s website.

And those living in north London, Torbay, Devon and parts of Hampshire are feared to be most susceptible at the moment. These areas have had the most confirmed cases in the UK. Six people have died so far after being diagnosed with Covid- in the UK, reports Devon Live . However, coronavirus has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation. For updates on the coronavirus outbreak,  read our live blogPHEaposs useful tool shows that, of am on March , , there were  cases confirmed in the capital. A further  had been recorded in the southeast of England, and  people had been infected in the southwest. There had been some  cases recorded in the northwest of England. A further  were recorded across the Midlands. As a result, the NHS in England will ramp up testing facilities so , more coronavirus tests can be performed each day.  Professor Dame Sue Hill, NHS chief scientic officer, said: “The NHS is ramping up the number of testing centres across the country, to help people get care quickly or have their mind put at ease. “England’s NHS has world-leading expertise and every hospital across the country, and the healthcare professionals who run them, are now actively planning to respond flexibly to manage new demand. “The public can help us to help the country to stay safe by practising good hygiene and washing their hands more often, for at least  seconds.”  Now local hospital labs will join specialist services, including those already provided by PHE, in being able to accurately detect the presence of the new virus. Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, added: “Wider testing is important as it allows us to continue to meet demand as the number of people being tested increases in the coming weeks. This will ensure that PHE and the NHS have the most robust system possible to understand what is happening with the virus.

Even with a cold it takes a few weeks to get rid of it. She goes blue and gets breathless. Iaposm not so worried about myself, but for Kyra itaposs really scary.

Schools across the country were put on alert tonight that they might need to shut their doors for a fortnight, the Mirror can reveal. The nationwide coronavirus closures could come into effect on March  - weeks before the traditional Easter break. It would mean youngsters spending a month out of the classroom and create a childcare nightmare for working parents. Follow our coronavirus live blog for the latest updates Another plan being considered is shortening the Easter break by a week and scrapping the May half-term. But this would create havoc with families who have already booked trips away during the traditional holidays. Teachers have been told the ‘home-learning packs’ must be ready to send out by Friday. But sources said any enforced closure would almost certainly not take place until the end of next week. The packs include coursework for GCSE and A-Level students and curriculum-based learning for younger children. Schools are also busy compiling lists of children who have access to the internet at home. The plan is for work to be set via online education s that pupils can log-on to remotely. Workers are also expected to go into schools during the shutdown to perform ‘deep cleans’.  One teacher said: “We have had guidance from our head of the academy who has been told to expect at least a week-long closure, possibly two. “If schools are closed from mid-March, it wouldn’t make sense to open them up again so close to Easter. We’re preparing for a month at home. “The home-learning packs have to be all ready by this Friday, with the aim of sending them home with the kids the following Friday.” Another teacher at a school in the north of England said they had been ordered to get emergency plans underway.  They told the Mirror: “We have been told an extended Easter break is a very real possibilitythe virus spread continues at the predicted rate. “We are now preparing for that eventuality. But this will not mean two weeks’ extra holiday. “Schools in our local authority area - both primary and secondary – are drawing up plans for children to be given lessons at home.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAs the first baby born on the NHS, Aneira ‘Nye’ Thomas is forever linked to the British institution that revolutionised healthcare around the world. Here, in exclusive extracts from her new book Hold On Edna!, she tells the fascinating background to her historic birth, the tragedy and jubilation of her own experiences of childbirth, and why both she and her daughter have dedicated their working lives to the National Health Service. “Edna,” says the doctor, coming to stand beside the bed. “You need to wait. It’s not long now. Don’t push. Just hold on, Edna.” In three minutes, it will be July , . She waits until that long, achingly slow clock hand ticks over, and then she pushes. I come barrelling into the world at a minute past midnight, the first baby to be born on the NHS. “Have you thought of a name yet ” asks the doctor later that day, his pen balanced over the papers in his hand. It’s a few hours since my birth, and Edna’s face has regained some of its colour. “Becausenot,” said the doctor, “I have an idea. She should be named for the man who made this possible. “The man who allowed her to be born here, for free. After Nye Bevan. “Call her Aneira.” Edna thinks for a moment, the word filtering through the air. It has a lovely lilt to it – strong and playful all at once. She starts to nod. “My National Health Service baby,” she says. “Yes. Aneira.”  A month prior, when the consultants visited, Edna had been flabbergasted. “We came to talk to you about your baby, Mrs Rees,” one said. “The reason we’re here today is because of your due date. Your baby is due to be born at the beginning of July. From next month we’ll be able to offer a very dferent kind of medical care to you, and to your family. “The National Health Service commences its operations. “The man responsible for all this grew up not too far away. We’d like to honour him by ensuring the first child born under this new service – this new, entirely free service – hails from the same land he calls home.” Edna was suddenly overcome. She stared at her husband Willie, who looked equally taken aback.  “And you want that baby…” she said slowly, “to be mine ” “Yes,” they said together. “You’ll be the first woman who needn’t worry about her health costs while she’s giving birth,” said the first doctor. The first woman to do something none of your family will have been able to do.” So here she is, my mother, in Amman Valley village hospital. She cannot believe the bustle and pace of the place, the equipment lining the corridors. Everything, it seems, is ready – there are beds, but a good many of them are empty. Jars of medicine sit labelled and unopened on pristine-looking shelves, tubes and swabs and metres of curled gauze sit in baskets. The staff seem to far outnumber the patients. It will take time for people to realise they can come here, whatever they do or however much they earn. The birth of the NHS received scant coverage, mostly hidden in the back pages, and editorials were peppered with distrust.  Perhaps many feared it was little more than a pipe dream. I suppose my mother, in the hours following my birth, was one of the first to realise just how momentous the change had been. For hours, she’d been seen to by the nurses and doctors on duty, given pain relief, had her baby delivered and wrapped up warm and handed back to her, checked over and healthy. It was such a far cry from my brother Eddie’s birth in the barn four years ­previously. Over the course of my first year I received inoculations, treatment for a rash, and cough medicine – all of it handed to my wide-eyed mother. My early le was spent in part at the smallholding of Rhydcerrig and then at a new council estate called Is-Y-Lyn, or “Below the Lake”. It was a happy childhood. A busy, fun-filled one – with six elder siblings, I never lacked playmates. I passed my -plus and people askedI’d thought of becoming a nurse. It might seem odd, but I hadn’t. I’d never considered a career with the National Health Service, despite how intrinsically linked I was to it. “Well look, Nye, you’ve gotta do something, eh ” said my aunt. My parents were delighted. I was accepted as a nursing assistant once I’d finished school. In , aged , I was duly fitted up for my unorm: pink, with a white cap.  I will never forget the fear of my first day on the wards. It was a mental-health unit and there were  male patients. Talk about thrown in at the deep end! Then, at the age of , a suave, ­handsome-looking bus driver, Dennis, asked me out. It progressed quickly, our relationship. Some weeks later, I fainted at work. I knew as I stared up at the ceiling that my last, missed period was no fluke. Dennis and I married on  September , at St Michael’s Church. The following year – after a long, traumatic labour – our first baby was born at a healthy eight pounds and promptly whisked away. I never heard him cry, but the nurses – bustling around, shooting reassuring glances – told me this was standard. I was in hospital for days, unable to do very much at all. I was desperate for word of my baby – I’d decided to call him Gary Anthony – but no word came. After a week, a sister approached the end of my bed and told me my baby had died. I could barely breathe. I had not seen him since the moment of his birth, and now he was gone  It was a horric episode of my le. One thing it did teach me, however, was the delicacy of childbirth.  My next two children were born: Kevin in  and Lindsey in , precious babies whose births were just as traumatic as Gary’s, but who nonetheless survived and thrived. I required transfusions after Lindsey’s birth and, just as the service had brought me into the world, so it saved me time and again through dficult pregnancies and messy, complicated births. It doesn’t surprise me and it may not surprise you to learn that Lindsey’s career took her straight into the NHS. She works as a frontline paramedic. Five years ago, I was at home one morning when the phone rang. “Lindsey’s had an accident.” I drove faster and more furiously than I’ve ever driven to the hospital, where a consultant informed us Lindsey had suffered a subarachnoid brain haemorrhage.

Phillip Meyer, , from Kent, said he was told by the  service on March  that he and his -year-old son Gabriel needed to be tested. But despite daily calls to the NHS, this still has yet to materialise. Mr Meyer, from Westerham in Kent, told the : Weaposve either slipped through the cracks, or the Government is really not doing a very good job of testing people. And I fear itaposs the latter. Mr Meyer and his we and two sons went on a half-term family skiing trip to South Tyrol on the border between Italy and Austria. The family started to self-isolate after their son was sent home from school with a cough a few days after coming back. We were told that someone would call us back to organise a test,he said. But weaposve since been waiting, waiting, and waiting. Iaposve called  every day but thereaposs been no more information. They can see on the system that we had been referred and were waiting to be called by a hospital for testing.  When Mr Meyer suggested turning up at Maidstone hospital for a drive-in test, he was told he would be removed from the queue of people to be tested and thereaposs no guarantee youaposll be tested at the hospitalapos. He added: My main concern is that I donapost want to spread this to other people. People at my sonsapos school are understandably anxious to know whether we have been tested, and we canapost tell them anything. Itaposs awful. So our whole family are just self-isolating. If Iaposm getting this, there must be thousands of people who are in the same situation. Iaposm lucky to be able to do the job I do from home.  Italians are being told to stay at home as the crisis unfolds, with the number of cases topping ,. Authorities have confirmed that  people have died after contacting the virus. The government announced a nationwide lockdown in an effort to contain coronavirus, as Italy has the highest rate outside China.

The newly married police officer, , suffered catastrophic injuries after trying to stop three teenagers stealing a quad bike on August  last year. The Old Bailey today heard how the Thames Valley police constable desperately flailed his arms like a rag doll after he became tangled in a loading strap attached to their getaway car. They allegedly dumped the £, bike but pulled PC Harper, who had become trapped around the ankles, for over a mile after roaring down Lambdens Hill, a country lane in Bradfield Southend, Bekshire. The officer who was with him, PC Andrew Shaw, likened the moment he was dragged away by the SEAT vehicle to when a water-skier loses his footing and is whipped forward before landing on his back.  Driver Henry Long, , allegedly swerved from side to side in an attempt to free the officer, causing him to hit hedgerows and other items in the lane. Prosecuting, Brian Altman, QC described how two of PC Harperaposs colleagues, both police dog handlers, were waiting in their cars at the A junction after being alerted to what had happened. One of them, PC Andrew Kemp, described coming across his fellow officeraposs body - which by then had been stripped naked - in Ufton Lane. As the SEAT crossed the A, PC Kemp saw what he thought was strapping trailing from the vehicle, and, as he turned into Ufton Lane, he saw what he thought were ratchet straps in the road, Mr Altman said. To his right he saw out of the corner of his eye something moving and tumbling in the road. At the same time, he heard on the radio a message from his colleague PC Christopher Bushnell, the other dog unit, who had driven ahead of him, that there was a body from the car or thrown from the car.

Some of the hotels on the Spanish island are expected to remain closed until June.  While there are only ten confirmed cases of coronavirus in Majorca, the holiday destination has been hit hard by punters fearful of the disease. The Hotel Chain Association announced that there had been more cancellations than reservations on the Balearic island. The low occupancy rates are expected to continue for the next five or six weeks. The organisation said that all hotels with less than % of beds filled would close. Those booked into the beleaguered institutions would be moved to hotels that remain open. The president of ACH, Gabriel Llobera, told the Olive Press : The low sales levels are unlikely to change in the next two weeks, so the Balearic Islands and other holiday will be affected at Easter. The cancellation of a high profile medical event is also likely to hurt business on the island. The XV Congress of the Spanish Society of Glaucoma has been called off, meaning  ophthalmologists will not longer be heading to Majorca.  The coronavirus spread across the world is predicted to have a huge financial impact on the tourist industry. The International Air Transport association has estimated that its losses of £ billion in . Today the global nature of the viral spread was confirmed by the World Health Organisation.

A man who recently travelled to Europe and then back to Turkey tested positive for the disease. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said the patient was in quarantine and his relatives are being monitored. If the strict preventative measures that have already been implemented by the authorities are anything to go by, then holidaymakers heading to Turkey in the summer may be in for some dficulties. All international passengers are being screened with a thermal camera, the UK government said of the country in its latest coronavirus advice. Those displaying signs of a temperature will then be referred to a medical adviser. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.Anyone who has been in Italy during the past fortnight is not currently allowed into Turkey, the Daily Star reported.  If the country does lock down its borders as the coronavirus pandemic rumbles on, a lot of Brits will be affected. Each year .million people head to the country from the UK on holiday. Many holiday hotspots have already began to feel the impact of the coronavirus. Hotels on Majorca are expected to remain closed until June.

Declaring Covid- a apospandemicapos and expressing major concerns of the levels of aposinactionapos by governments across the globe, WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added that the tide can be turned on the deadly coronavirus. The WHO chief said several countries had shown it can be suppressed and controlled but questioned whether all had the resolve to do what was required. The doctor called on countries to take a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach, built around a comprehensive strategy to prevent infections, save lives and minimize impact. He summarised it in four key areas:Prepare and be ready. Detect, protect and treat. Reduce transmission. Innovate and learn.Dr Ghebreyesus said: All countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimizing economic  social disruption and respecting human rights. WHO’s mandate is public health. But we’re working with many partners across all sectors to mitigate the social and economic consequences of this Covid- pandemic. Every person in the world, and every sector of society, must join the fight against Covid-, said Dr Ghebreyesus. He described it as not not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector. He added: We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace, and mobilize their people in the response, those with a handful of Covid- cases can prevent those cases becoming clusters, and those clusters becoming community transmission. Sounding a final not of optimism, Dr Ghebreyesus said beating the deadly virus was doable. He said: I remind all countries that we are calling on you to ready your hospitals, and protect and train your healthworkers. Let’s all look out for each other.  There’s been so much attention on one word. Let me give you some other words that matter much more, and that are much more actionable: Prevention. Preparedness. Public health. Political leadership. And most of all, People. We’re in this together, to do the right things with calm and protect the citizens of the world. It’s doable. Meanwhile in the UK, health secretary Matt Hancock has been speaking in the House of Commons this evening. He said Parliament will be kept open.  Mr Hancock said: “This afternoon the World Health Organisation declared coronavirus a global pandemic. I’ve spoken to the leader of the House and we have had discussions Mr Speaker, and we have resolved that we will keep Parliament open. “Of course, in some ways this House may have todferently, but the ability to hold the Government to account and to legislate are as vital in a time of emergency as in normal times - our democracy is the foundation of our way of le.” He added that the Government will continue to work closely with Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, the Lord Speaker and the authorities in both Houses in the coming days and weeks. Mr Hancock added: “As the leader of the House said in business questions last week the public will expect Parliament to sit and to get on with its job. Our approach will be guided by the best scientic evidence and medical advice and we will take all necessary measures to deal with this outbreak.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus world health organisations full","story":"NewsCoronavirus: World Health Organisations full statement as Covid- declared pandemicChief of the World Health Organisation Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called for countries and iniduals to step up in the fight against the Covid- disease which is caused by coronavirusShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video world-health-organisation-class-coronavirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news coronavirus-world-health-organisations-full-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the blunt admission that the Covid- form of the coronavirus should now be characterized as a pandemic. By the organisations own definition, a pandemic is defined as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”. Dr Tedros said: In the past two weeks, the number of cases of Covid- outside China has increased -fold and the number of affected countries has tripled. There are now more than , cases in  countries and , people have lost their lives. Thousands more are fighting for their lives in hospitals. In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of Covid- cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected countries climb even higher. WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore made the assessment that Covid- can be characterized as a pandemic. Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that,misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustied acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.  Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this coronavirus It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do. We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. And we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time. WHO has been in full response mode since we were notied of the first cases. We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear.As I said on Monday, just looking at the number of Covid- cases and the number of countries affected does not tell the full story. Of the , Covid- cases reported globally in  countries, more than  percent of cases are in just four countries, and two of those – China and South Korea - have signicantly declining epidemics.  countries have not reported any Covid- cases, and  countries have reported  cases or less. We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace, and mobilize their people in the response, those with a handful of Covid- cases can prevent those cases becoming clusters, and those clusters becoming community transmission. “Even those countries with community transmission or large clusters can turn the tide on this coronaviru.  Several countries have demonstrated that this virus can be suppressed and controlled. The challenge for many countries who are now dealing with large Covid- clusters or community transmission is not whether they can do the same – it’s whether they will. “Some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resources. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve. We are grateful for the measures being taken in Iran, Italy and South Korea ro slow the virus and control their Covid- epidemics. We know that these measures are taking a heavy toll on societies and economies, just as they did in. All countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimizing economic  social disruption and respecting human rights.  WHO’s mandate is public health. But we’re working with many partners across all sectors to mitigate the social and economic consequences of this Covid- pandemic. This is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector – so every sector and every inidual must be involved in the fight. I have said from the beginning that countries must take a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach, built around a comprehensive strategy to prevent infections, save lives and minimize impact.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/19893463-859x564.jpg ","title":"dundee 2 0 ayr hemmings and crankshaw goals see dark blues leapfrog honest men","story":"A FIFTH clean sheet on the bounce saw Dundee move into third spot after a deserved - victory over Ayr United at Dens Park.The Dark Blues stretched their unbeaten run to six matches as they saw off the Honest Men thanks to Kane Hemmings# th-minute opener and Olly Crankshaw#s first for the club.There were two changes to the Dundee starting XI as Christie Elliott replaced Cammy Kerr at right wing-back while Andrew Nelson came in for Jordan McGhee, who hadn#t recovered from a dead leg picked up against the Honest Men on Saturday.Goalkeeper Jack Hamilton was missing from the squad after his we gave birth on Monday night.

products scarce on supermarket shelves amid coronavirus panic","story":"Panicked Dundonians have cleared the shelves of medicine, hand sanitiser and toilet paper at shops across the city as coronavirus fears rise.Armies of anxious buyers have flocked to the shops in order to stock up on medical essentials as well as food and toiletries.It comes following almost a fortnight of fear over coronavirus, which first arrived on Scottish shores on March . vw, px\"  There has still been just one confirmed case of the virus in Tayside, with another  across the rest of Scotland.But it hasn’t stopped residents across the city stocking up on essentials as they prepare for the next stage of Covid- – which could see the country on “lockdown”, with the majority of people working from home and large events cancelled in a worst-case scenario.The panic-buying has led to stocks of hand sanitiser being sold out across the city, forcing pharmacies such as Boots to introduce a “two units per person” rule. vw, px\"  The rule has been imposed on other products such as baby sterilising and antibacterial products, hand wash, cough, cold and pain relief, children’s medicines, thermometers and tissues.A spokeswoman for the company said: “The best way to help prevent catching a virus is by making sure that you regularly wash your hands with soap, and avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth to prevent transmission from surfaces, especially after blowing your nose, sneezing and coughing.“All our pharmacists can offer advice on the best way to stay healthy this winter.”In Home Bargains, signs were put up next to the toilet paper warning of store detectives keeping an eye on shoppers. vw, px\"  Painkillers such as ibuprofen were also sold out in the bargain superstore, and in Tesco signs have been put up informing shoppers that anti-bacterial wipes won’t be available until Saturday.The Nethergate Tesco sold out of Dettol surface cleaner and the shelves were clear of hay fever medication, with one sign warning allergy tablets were out of stock until next month.It is understood that Tesco has now put quantity limits on some essential items such as antibacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetablesShoppers also cleared out the shelves at Asda Milton in an attempt to stock up, with barely any supplies left behind in certain areas.Items such as shampoo, mouthwash and women’s razors were also in short supply.Sainsbury’s on Tom Johnston Road was also running low on similar items and also introduced limits on some medicines. vw, px\"  In Monieth, South Grange Care Centre has closed its doors to visitors in order to keep its elderly patients safe from the coronavirus.A spokesman said: “We would like to reassure residents and families at South Grange Care Centre that we are fully adhering to guidelines from Public Health England with regards to coronavirus.“In aligning with this we have asked that friends and relatives minimise their visits to residents in our homes.“Some of our residents are vulnerable to the virus and we therefore need to work together to limit the risk.“We are working hard to ensure residents and families are able to contact each other through other means.“If visits are necessary then we ask that visitors consult the official guidelines, which are regularly updated, beforehand.“Staff in our homes will remain on heightened alert and ensure that any resident or staff member with any symptoms will be referred to their GP and local health protection agency who will advise the home management team in relation to further management and any precautions necessary to ensure our residents and staff remain safe.”However, while large-scale events across Europe are being cancelled or delayed, closer to home it is understood to be “business as usual” with the BBC making assurances that Radio ’s Big Weekend in Camperdown Park would be going ahead this May.Festival bosses are said to be actively monitoring the developing situation around Covid-, but anticipate the festival going ahead as planned – unless otherwise advised.The city council has also sought to assure parents it is following up-to-date guidelines from Health Protection Scotland to ensure children are properly-protected from an outbreak, and has not ruled out cancelling school trips to countries and places deemed high-risk.Dundee City Council has moved to reassure parents over coronavirus fears and sent out guidelines on how children can best avoid the virus.The local authority sent letters to parents and carers yesterday, which confirmed there had been no pupils at schools in the city who had yet been affected by the virus.The letter, which was sent to parents at Forthill Primary School and was seen by the Tele, said: “To date, we have had no cases of Covid- in any Dundee school.“As ever, our first concern is for the safety and well-being of pupils and staff, so all our staff are following the latest guidance provided by Health Protection Scotland, which has published specic guidance on www.hps.scot.nhs.uk to assist those in schools, early years childcare and other educational settings. This page will be updated as more information emerges.”The council has assured parents it was following the appropriate guidelines in its bid to combat coronavirus, as it encourages children to wash hands regularly, distributes NHS advice posters throughout schools and in all staff rooms, reviews planned schools trips and keeps in contact with the Scottish Government, NHS and other partner agencies to ensure it has the latest and best advice and information."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee finding form as united stutter on title march","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, Sean Hamilton and Graeme Finnan dissect Dundee’s recent upturn in fortunes, discuss what United need to do to get their title march back on course and Billy Gilmour – is he good enough to be capped Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"mystery-author-glasgow-shipbuilders-poem","story":"WHILE clearing out her late fatherrsquos home, Rachel Willis discovered a yellowing, slightly tattered piece of paper, lovingly preserved in his belongings."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-university-graduate-became-uks-first-female-lawyer","story":" Madge Easton Anderson is one of six trailblazing women from Scotlandrsquos past to have been recognised with a Historic Environment ScotlandCommemorative Plaque this month.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

the illness.Here the PA news agency takes a closer look at the delay phase:ndash What is the ldquodelay phase The delay phase will see a mixture of the same advice given out, such as encouraging the

faces.It would also provide a buffer to allow a possible vaccine to be developed, although this would not come into use for at least another year.The Governmentrsquos planning document explained:

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC.

learning.ldquoIn most lessons, the ethos is now calm and purposeful.ldquoThis is an important improvement since previous inspection visits.ldquoYoung people relate well to each other and to their teachers.ldquoAcross the school, helpful routines are being established.ldquoYoung people have contributed meaningfully to the revised Promoting Positive Relationships and Behaviour policy.ldquoTeachers value the wide range of professional learning opportunities on relationships for learning.ldquoMost teachers now feel better equipped and empowered to manage behaviour that is

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Aside from the occasional draught which we could dodge by retreating to the back room, it was wonderfully toasty. This was in large part thanks to generous neighbours above and below whose central heating kept us permanently cocooned.In the country, as I quickly learned, in winter there are two main subjects of conversation: weather and warmth, but the greater of these is warmth. Hoolet, like many villages around here, has no gas supply, so central heating runs either by electricity or oil. The topic of electricity bills leads to much sucking in of breath, although there was one couple whose house somehow escaped the notice of the electricity board.Only when they sold up and the new owners found they werenrsquot being charged did it become clear why there had always been such a blazing array of Christmas lights in this particular garden. Rumour has it that, years earlier, a woman in this area greased a palm and had her meter erted to a lamp-post. It took a while before the extraordinarily high reading was finally noticed and an investigation began. Soon she was tracked down, along with her cannabis plants.The day is approaching when wersquoll all have to switch to renewables, but in the meantime our radiators drink oil. Every few days I check the gauge on the tank in the garden, half-closing my eyes as I pull out the pin and watch it drop one inch, then two. Since it can take over a week between ordering and getting a refill, you have to estimate how long it will last. If nothing , becoming aware of every drop of oil you use does mean that, while itrsquos the least environmentally friendly of fuels, it is never squandered. One friend is so thrty her grandchildren have renamed her house The Baltic.Long before, and after, they became fashionable, everyone around here wears a gilet. People only come to their doors in a tee-shirttheyrsquove been interrupted in the process of layering. I was watching a western the other night and saw a tobacco-spitting rancher on his porch, rle under his stained armpit. What caught my attention was his long-johns, the sort that reach from ankle to chin to wrist, with buttons down the front. Theyrsquore exactly what I need.Other than the relief of seeing the orange lights of the oil tanker arriving in the pitch black of a winterrsquos morning, there is nothing interesting about oil. Our other source of heat, however, is wood-burning stoves, and on this subject I could win Mastermind. We have two, which possibly saved my husbandrsquos le. When the Beast From the East descended on Hoolet, he was left with a gaping hole in the kitchen wall where the boiler had been taken out moments before the blizzard started. The heating engineers fled to get over Soutra Hill before they were snowed in, and his ordeal began: two log fires and two hot water bottles to get him through five days until the roads reopened. When he went into the kitchen to cook dinner, he had to wear hat and gloves as well as his puffa jacket.There is nothing more comforting in the cold than a roaring fire. In rural parts this is not a lestyle choice but an absolute necessity. Of an evening we get through about five logs, which is enough to keep a large room really cosy. When we started out, we were so ignorant wersquod never even heard the phrase ldquokiln dried and ndash Irsquom going beetroot just thinking about it ndash we bought logs in bags from BQ. Now, having found a good supplier, and with our own woodstore, the first thing we notice as we drive around the area is other peoplersquos woodpiles.Some are works of art, high as a gable end and stacked so expertly theyrsquore as solid as drystane dykes. A few keep them in a ramshackle heap, out in the open, where they soak up the rain. Quite apart from the level of emissions wet wood produces, which is why itrsquos high on the governmentrsquos hit-list, it is far less efficient, generating less warmth and more smoke. Butyoursquore patient, green wood dries out ndash Irsquove heard you should wait two years for anything yoursquove cut down yourself. My father would have scoffed at that, as hersquod bring the car to a sudden halt, nip out and drag a huge storm-tossed branch into the boot ndash ldquotidying up the countryside as he put it. Back home, he stoked the flames so high we had to push the furniture back against the walls and open the living room door.The other day we had a delivery of ash, dumped in front of the house in a crate big enough to hold a wild boar. As the lumberjack was in bed barking like a sea-lion, it fell to me to deal with it. I was well on my way when Lazarus rose from the duvet to check on the proceedings and pointed out that I was laying them sideways rather than end-on. As the sun disappeared and clouds gathered I started again. By this time a neighbour had spotted me, and helped me finish the job.The sense of satisfaction in having it all safely stored, shortly before snowfall, was incalculable. Thatrsquos the thing about wood. The connection between you and the trees yoursquore burning creates a new respect and understanding. For a start, freshly chopped logs give off a delicious scent. And each one is dferent ndash whorled, fissured, misshapen, or neatly wedged like a giant slice of cake. If you chose to count the rings yoursquod see how many years had gone into making a blaze that lasts only a few hours."},{"url":null,"title":"matt-lucas-replaces-sandi-toksvig-great-british-bake-off","story":"The former Little Britain star, , replaces Sandi Toksvig and will present alongside Noel Fielding.He will join the flagship Channel  programme when filming for the th series begins in spring.:Stars feel the pressure in the bake off tentLucas said: ldquoIrsquom chuffed to bits to be joining the most delicious show on television.ldquoI canrsquot wait to break bread with Noel, Prue and Paul and meet the brilliant bakers.ldquoAnd bearing in mind my love of cake, Irsquove already ordered some much larger trousers in anticipation.

It could be that the disruption caused by the coronavirus will turn out to be a relative blip and le willto normal, including regular travel abroad. Soon enough, the crowds could be back.It is not guaranteed, though. Travel, even at the best of times, is becoming more trouble than it is worth. Holidays abroad are increasingly spent recovering from the trip there and steeling oneself for the journey back. Hell is the modern airport.Given this, and increased awareness of climate change, more people will want to holiday close to home. Those who come from further afield will expect as eco-friendly a holiday as possible once they get here.Scotland is ideally placed to do well out of these changes. Or it would bewe had a transport system that was not a national embarrassment.The latest snafu is the cancellation of sailings between Brodick and Ardrossan. This is the busiest route in the CalMac network, serving , passengers. It is a flagship service in every sense, essential to Arran residents, businesses, and the wider tourist industry.There cannot be many Scots families who have not spent holidays on Arran. It is a fantastic island, the kind of place most countries would love to have a ferry ride away. The tourist board punts it as ldquoScotland in miniature but a better tag might be ldquoLike Vancouver Island, but closer.: Further ferry delays fearedNot only do Scots make good use of it, we recommend it, and indeed the rest of Scotland, wherever we go in the world. Yoursquoll have a great time, we tell people. To that we should add ldquoas long as you go at the right time.As far as travelling to Arran goes, now is not the best of times. It emerged this week that due to a fault with the mooring equipment ships can no longer berth safely in bad weather. According to CalMac the repairs could take up to six weeks, which runs right into the peak Easter holiday period.Why will it take so long  Because CalMac needs to source spare parts. If the parts were so essential one might imagine they would be held in stock, but that is to assume a level of efficiency that is proving beyond the service operators and their ultimate bosses, the Scottish Government.The latest problems take place against the backdrop of spiralling costs and y delays in the delivery of two new ferries. Vessels that should have cost pound million are now priced at more than double that, and they will not be in operation till  at least.Gavin Fulton, chair of Arran Ferry Action Group, has described the situation as ldquoa shambles. He told The Heraldrsquos reporter Martin Williams that patients on the island were having to spend up to five days on the mainland just to get to a hospital appointment and back.ldquoThings are going from bad to worse for us and there is no contingency plan, he added. ldquoThere is no word of chartering a boat, or to buy one abroad. It is a case of waiting  months for a new ferry and we have to put up with it.Mr Fulton is not alone in his despair. Another essential route, at the Rest and Be Thankful, is prone to closure due to landslips, forcing drivers on a -mile detour. It was announced recently that more millions are to be spent on repairs rather than a reroute of the A. Iain Jurgensen of the Argyll and The Isles Tourism Co-operative said it was ldquostaggering and irresponsible to keep spending public money on patching the problem rather than sorting it out once and for all.: Anger as services haltedIt is not just rural areas that are suffering from the lack of a joined up transport system in Scotland. Rail travel between two of the countryrsquos biggest cities is expensive, unreliable and overcrowded. Bus services across the country y wildly in price and efficiency. In Glasgow the subway does not operate on a Sunday evening. Too often the only way to ensure getting somewhere on time is to go by car, and even then good luck with the potholes.Of course there have been successes, chief among them the Queensferry Crossing. Leaving aside recent closures due to snow and ice the bridge was delivered with only a slight delay, again due to weather, and under budget, something of a miracle for large projects.Yet the Queensferry Crossing aside, Scotlandrsquos transport is too often in reverse or going nowhere fast.Part of the problem is that the subject has become politicised, alongside much  in Scottish le. Take the recent Queensferry Crossing closures. Instead of having a rational discussion about them, the row became another proxy war over Scottish independence. Criticising Scotlandrsquos transport, like questioning educational attainment or NHS waiting times, is seen as ldquotalking Scotland down.It would be funnyit was not so ridiculous. When you travel to another country you donrsquot give two toots of a horn who built what road and when, or who runs the ferry service.: Time to end monopoly of ownershipAll the traveller wants is a reliable service that will take them where they want to go at a reasonable cost both to themselves and the planet. That is what Scots desire as well, and it is not too much to ask.Transport is such an obvious building block for any successful country it should be above political bickering. Even given the problems of geography, it should not be beyond our ability to build a national transport infrastructure that works for all the people most of the time.Since nothing broadens the mind on transport like using the system, herersquos a suggestion.

The highest number of cases ndasheight ndash has been detected in Lothian.It came as health bosses outlined plans to deploy thousands of student nurses and medical students to bolster frontline NHS resources for a surge in seriously ill patients.Scotlandrsquos Health secretary Jeane Freeman said NHS modelling indicated that the virus could result in an absence rate of between  per cent and % among health service workers.NHS staff are at ldquogreater risk of contracting the disease as a result of caring for infected patients, even with protective equipment.To help cope with staff shortages, Ms Freeman said the NHS is looking at how recently retired staff canto work, as well as how those who are almost qualied can help.Ms Freeman said there are ldquosomething like , available nursing students as well as medical students in their fth and final year of university study.She said they could play an ldquoimportant role in supporting the NHS, but would only be asked to do skills within their training.NHS England also unveiled plans to parachute up to , third-year undergraduate nurses onto the frontline as paid volunteers.Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said the UK would be ldquoshortly entering a phase where we are going to be taking measures at the population level to spread the number of cases over a long period of time to lessen the impact on the NHS. He added: ldquoWe have a window of days, a few weeks, to get ourselves prepared.Ms Freeman also admitted that Scottish Government plans to increase the number of available hospital beds, including doubling Scotlandrsquos intensive care capacity, would be achieved partly by cancelling and delaying routine operations such as hip and knee replacements.NHS bosses have insisted that urgent work such as cancer surgery and chemotherapy would not be affected. Scotland has around , acute beds and  in intensive care units, but the Government has estimated that a worst-case scenario could see around , requiring critical care.Ms Freeman said: ldquoWe have active work going on looking at how we can increase the number of beds available in our hospital settings, doubling the number of intensive care units that we have and equipping them and staffing them. You start to make dficult decisions about NHS care that is critical to le ndash that would be cancer treatment, transplants, maternity care ndashfrom NHS care that is not critical to le. That is some of our elective work, the replacements of knees, hips andso on.ldquoYou start to scale down the non-critical in order to free up the space for the critical.ldquoThat is where you get additional bed space but you also can get additional intensive care space.There were also warnings that the Houses of Parliament could exacerbate the epidemic in the wake of health minister Nadine Dorriesrsquo diagnosis with Covid-. She was self-isolating at home as both her offices were sealed off and one of her staff fell ill.Glasgow MP Carol Monaghan said: ldquoOn top of the  MPs and the  peers, it is estimated that up to , people work on the parliamentary estate, with , more visiting daily.ldquoEach week we are crammed into a pungent chamber that is too small to accommodate everyone, and find ourselves up close and personal in crowded voting lobbies.ldquoAfter our week in Westminster we travel back to every part of the UK to meet local constituents and organisations. Anything we may have picked up in these confined conditions will be taken with us, and by continuing to operate Parliament in this manner, we could be creating  vectors for this virus.It comes as a petition to close schools and colleges across the UK exceeded , signatures, and Europa League clashes between Spanish and Italian sides Sevilla and Roma, and Inter Milan and Getafe, were postponed in a bid to curb infections.The Premier League also called off its first match over fears that Arsenal players ndash who were due to face Manchester City ndash might have been exposed to the virus when Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, who has tested positive for the virus, visited the Emirates stadium."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-interest-rates-slashed","story":"ldquoItrsquos dferent form of shock than , he said.ldquoThere is no reason for this shock to turn into the experience of  ndash a virtual lost decade in a number of economies ndashwe handle this well.The comments came during a hastily convened press conference yesterday morning, after the Bank of England announced a surprise package of measures aimed at combating the effects of the coronavirus.Threadneedle Street cut interest rates from . per cent to .% ndash the steepest rate in  years and back down to the lowest level in history.The move is aimed at unlocking billions of pounds for banks to keep lending to businesses and ensure that cash flows through the economy.Mr Carney said the stimulus package amounted to ldquonorth of % of GDP and would allow banks to theoretically lend  times the total lent to businesses in the UK in .He added: ldquoAlthough the magnitude of the economic shock from coronavirus is highly uncertain, activity is likely to weaken materially in the UK over the coming months.Incoming governor Andrew Bailey ndash who was also at the special meeting to vote on the measures ahead of starting in the role next weekndash said banks had ldquono excuses not to keep lending to households and businesses, and pass on the rate cut.ldquoWe expect them to treat customers fairly ndash thatrsquos what must happen.

It is well documented that we were expected to have a new vessel on this route two years ago. While we were working on an original lead-time of six weeks from Europe for a replacement mooring winch for the Caledonian Isles, we now believe this will be much shorter and we can bring the vessel back into full service earlier.However, the suggestion that there are suitable vessels somewhere in the world ready to be leased or bought and take over the Arran run is unfortunately not true. There are no second-hand ferries available which meet the unusually shallow draft requirements on the West Coast, interface into our port infrastructure and which can operate in our challenging waters. We have continually searched the market along with Cmal in the last six years and brokers are fully alert to our needs. While a number of vessels have been put forward, they have either not met the demanding requirements of UK class or the work required to get them to a class level would be uneconomic or unachievable.In the meantime, I can only apologise to the Arran community for the disruptions that are taking place, pledge that we are working with all partners to ensure the ferry is fully operational as soon as possible and assure you that we engage with communities on a daily basis around the disruption that occurs.Robbie Drummond,Managing Director, CalMac Ferries Ltd, Gourock.THAT Scottish politicians and many of your correspondents letters focus on nationalism in politics is understandable, but what are our elected politicians really in office for National defence against foreign invasions of all sorts, must claim top priority of course, but the maintenance of the law and vigorous encouragement of prosperity are close in importance.Reports of so-far-unsolved problems upon which local prosperity depends, respectively in the Aviemore area and the Isle of Arran, are still, after long delays, very worrying to the locals, visitors and harmful to Scotlands tourism.Thus, the damaged Cairngorm Mountain Railway and the failing connections by ferries with Arran ought to demand almost the very highest priority in our politicians attention.Looking after the infrastructure is likewise vital, from roads, including potholes, to buildings of all kinds needing maintenance and restoration.On the European continent especially, in say, the German-speaking countries, any such knotty problems arising which hurt both tourism and the national wellbeing are, in my observation, given very high priority. Logically, their politicos support and participate in these constructive efforts, with benefits to the locals and their visitors and also to national morale.Do our own politicos see these priorities that way, not forgetting that successful resolution of such dficulties are, very justiably, potential vote-winners  Charles Wardrop, Perth.Read more: Islanders anger as safety issue brings Scotlands busiest ferry to a haltRead more:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-need-scottish-parliament-ever-just-now","story":"The Westminster Parliament did not ldquochoose to pay us more. This is how the system works ndash it is the consequence of a process, rather than a ldquochoice. Of course, they could change the process now but the implications of this would be clear, for the Scottish deficit has not happened ldquoevery year. Ten years ago Scotlandrsquos deficit was less than that of the UK as a whole. We might not have been paying our way, but we were paying more of it than the UK as a whole. Nor is it a good idea to draw a conclusion based on only a few yearsrsquo data. Estimates of Scotlands fiscal position between  and  y between a surplus of pound billion and poundbn, mainly due to dferent assumptions about the rate of interest we would have earned on these surpluses.However, the important point is not just that Scotland would have had years with a very considerable surplus, but that this surplus could have been invested to provide a ldquonest egg for when things turned down. This was the strategy employed by Norway, who now have the biggest investment fund anywhere in the world, which will support them for many, many years to come. The UK in contrast chose to spend this, to reduce deficit requirements, pay for tax cuts, and continues to do so.In short Ms Stephensonrsquos use of the most current data is opportunistic, but it is less contentious than whether or not she is aware that the Scotland Office was responsible for health and education prior to devolution. The Scotland Office might not have been the direct provider, but it was the source of policy, and thinking that through is an object lesson in just why we need the Scottish Parliament more than ever just now.Imagine there were no Scottish Parliament, and policy was set and managed in the Scotland Office. While the Conservatives may have a UK majority of , in Scotland they have only six seats, while the SNP holds . However, the Secretary of State and all the ministers in the Scotland Office would all be Conservatives, implementing a series of policies resoundingly rejected by the Scottish electorate. This might be Ms Stephensonrsquos notion of democracy, but it certainly is not my own. She might do well to consider her own stricture to be acquainted ldquowith the facts, eventhey are not immediately obvious.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.I APOLOGISE to Jill Stephenson for my ldquowrong answer to her question on the benefits of devolved government: the answer is Scottish democratic accountability. In the governing model she refers toof the powers of the previous Scottish Office, she asserts ldquodirect Scottish control. I disagree totally.The job of Secretary of State for Scotland was considered as one of the lowest-ranked Cabinet ministers at Westminster: their purview was policy administration, not policy formulation, and they had very little elbow room for dferentiation for Scotland from the UK. Ironically they tended to utilise Scottish ldquonationalist opinion to emphasise a need for a softer delivery of any unpopular policy.The Barnett formula was instigated just a vast sums of oil revenue was pouring into the Treasury. Even with Barnett, Scotland has paid more money per capita than it has received over the le span of the policy _ and it can be taken away at any point by Westminster.It is not easy to figure out where British nationalism is leading Scotland.

After massive financial rescue following the disastrous Darien Scheme, ldquothe people of Scotland have been democratically well represented at the best, most respected Parliament in the world with, in many cases, Scots being at the helm of it.If Mr Quail feels the Westminster Parliament is ldquoanother government, he truly has totally been taken in by the hapless, controlling regime which they call the Scottish ldquoGovernment weekly failing ldquothe people of Scotland. Of course, Mr Quail and his like want to replace the ldquoother government with another government ndash based in Brussels. There is no logic in this.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.IF there were an election in Scotland tomorrow, we can be pretty sure the SNP would romp home again. Everyone is aware of the warped electoral system and of course that the pro-UK party voters would once again outnumber the nationalists but cancel each other out.Yet those outside looking in must wonder how a nationalist party that seems to stumble from one disaster and or scandal to the next, with eye-wateringly incompetent ministers and a leadership at war, can be so electorally successful.The answer clearly is that they are not voted in for achievement or competence or ability but on their willingness to keep a vocerous and zealous minority satisfied.How I wish we could get back to the old days when parties were elected on policies and competence.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.RUTH Marrtells us how lucky we are to live in Scotland.

The slow progress on establishing basic connectivity for businesses and iniduals in the Northern Isles has been deeply frustrating. Concrete action to remedy this problem can only be a good thing.“This, however, is only the first step. I have been led to understand that the first upgrades to the network are to begin in the autumn, and we will be looking for swt action.”He continued: “With a plan in place and an agreement signed there can be no more excuses. By  islanders will rightly expect an end to coverage not-spots and the arrival of a mobile network fit for purpose.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Speaking in a Westminster debate on Huawei and G, Mr Carmichael raised a recent report alleging the telecoms company’s use of forced labour by the repressed Uighur Muslim minority in China.Speaking during a debate on Wednesday this week, Mr Carmichael said: “Can I just bring to his attention a very recent report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, #Uighurs for Sale#, which reports a quite horric programme of exporting Uighurs from Xinjiang province to other parts of China. According to this report, in fact, Huawei is one of the companies that has benefitted.”Responding during the debate, Iain Duncan Smith MP said: “I think that’s shocking. I thinkthat is true it is an absolutely indictment and I do think the British Government has got to be speaking up more. It is shocking and it is time that we call it for what it is.”Summing up at the end of the debate, the minister for digital infrastructure, Matt Warman MP, said: #The UK has been vocal in drawing attention to the systematic violation of human rights of Uighur Muslims. We set out our expectations in the UK National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights.”Speaking after the debate, Mr Carmichael added: “The reports surrounding Huawei and the use of forced labour are concerning. Local people want better connectivity in the Northern Isles and where, but they don#t want it built on the back of slave labour. I would urge the Government to look at this aspect of Huawei’s business in particular before it goes any further into the G process.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Youth team Strom-West also offers a pathway for young girls to develop to senior football.Kirsty Brown, who plays for Kirkwall City, explained: “Women’s football in Orkney, over the last couple of years, has taken a massive step.“We’ve seen the development of Kirkwall City, in addition to Orkney Women’s Football Club, and the logical step now is try and come together, get as strong as we possibly can, and to get inter-county and Island Games going.“ is a massive step ahead of us. It’s not that long away, so we definitely need to work together and see what we can do.“There’s fantastic players in both sides. It’s great that we’ve got two clubs. It’s completely needed for the number of players in Orkney. Both teams are in the Highlands and Islands League this year, playing  matches each.“That’s a massive opportunity for the girls and women in Orkney to play competitively, but the association will bring these two teams together and form an even stronger squad who can play on an inter-county level.“The meeting itself is an initial AGM. We would really like to be in a position where we could form a committee, officially start the association, and move forward in the best way possible for the future of football.”Developing Orkney as a county squad and an Island Games regular will take time, effort and commitment.Like many sports, women’s football is now putting the building blocks in place for a successful Games in , but early discussions are taking place in regards to sending a side to the  Games in Guernsey.Nicola Croy, who plays her football for Orkney Women’s, said: “The  Games will be an eye-opener. There’s a lot of great teams out there, so it will show Orkney how much we need to come together as an Island Games team and prepare ourselves for our home  Games.“Once this committee is set up, we can start with developing the county and Island Games team.”Among the positions to fill will be coach of the new county side, tasked with guiding the development of the team and leading the team to success.And in a bid to expand the playing pool even further, women who may not be playing league football currently are still encouraged to attend the meeting in April.Brown added: “There is a magnitude of abilities out there in Orkney and they’re maybe not playing.“Anybody that wants to get involved in any way, come along on April . It’s a fantastic opportunity for girls and Orkney in general.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This data will then be used in further assessing the viability of the sites.The masts are due to be installed at Quanterness and Hoy by the end of March — with a dferent kind of measurement system being used at the site in Faray.Planning permission for the masts was approved in December last year.Meteorological masts are an assembly of bolted, galvanised steel tube sections, consisting of a series of anemometers, wind vanes and a data logger, solar , temperature sensor and antenna. The equipment gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.The masts will be up to  metres in height and will be in place for up to two years.If the Community Wind Farm Project#s proposals and sites are found through the planning process to be appropriate and the project goes forward, OIC believes it could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney. The council has stated that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling OIC to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon and providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council also hopes that developments will also allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a needs case for a new interconnector for Orkney, with the aim of substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Due to practical limitations, the Faray site has already had a Lidar system installed to measure wind speed and direction.  Lidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging and is very similar to radar.The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six turbines and the site on Faray has enough space for up to seven turbines. The current proposal at the site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines at a blade tip height of up to .m.Pre-application consultation for the proposed site at Quanterness took place in November last year and a planning application was lodged with the planning authority in January. OIC has since written to the Scottish Government to ask that they call in the application, on grounds of national signicance.Further public consultation events are planned for Hoy in March, with Faray events in Eday and Westray likely to take place in May.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace.

It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John.

Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new inquest sought","story":"RELATIVES For Justice are to ask the Attorney General for a fresh inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of republicanprisoner Francis Dodds.From St Katherine’s Road in St James’, Francis Doddswas sentenced to four years imprisonment in March  for possession of explosive material. The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages. The prison governor refused to allow this and unfortunately Francis was ed to Long Kesh and no arteriogram took place before he died.”Former prisoners can contact RFJ on   or email paul.butler@relativesforjustice"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent.

A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March .

I#ve no idea how many homes would have been visited afterwards. Surely there is some sort of policy in place that those delivering the goods should be abiding by Tesco told the Belfastthe company has a process for allowing customers to alert a delivery driver in advancethey want their delivery left at a convenient place for collection.The delivery will be placed into bags and left as requested - but the issue is that drivers need to know this in advance. Asda and Sainsburys had not replied to a request for a response, but Andrew Opie, director of Food and Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said all companies are working as hard as they can to minimise the impact of the virus.Most of our members are more than happy for the majority of online deliveries to be delivered on doorsteps when customers have suggested that they are self-isolating, he said.Despite dficult times, retailers strive to provide the best service for their customers, both online and in-store and are working as hard as they can to ensure consumers have access to whatever products they want.A PHA spokesperson reiterated that it remains vital the guidelines offered to those in self-isolation are followed.People in self-isolation are expected to follow the advice they have been given to limit any potential spread of the virus.With regard to deliveries, the Public Health Agency recommends that advice developed by Public Health England on this issue is followed.This advice states: #You will need to ask for helpyou require groceries, other shopping or medications.Alternatively, you can order by phone or online. The delivery instruction needs to state that the items are to be left outside, or in the porch, or as appropriate for your home#.Last week companies including Asda and Deliveroo issued advice to delivery drivers in a move to stop them from contracting the virus.Deliveroo riders have been sent official guidelines based on the advice of the NHS and public health bodies, which include how to stay safe when delivering an order.For Asda workers, home delivery staff have been advised to follow government advice, including guidance on hand-washing.

Staff are kept informed and are getting out the message that they are open for business.The Flybe situation is a further unwelcome obstacle and reduces our air connectivity. This lessens our appeal in the GB market, our largest international visitor base.The NIHF is keeping our members appraised of The Public Health Agency guidance and will continue to do so.Government has a role to play in ensuring that support for the tourism sector is provided. It is critical that we, along with the entire Northern Ireland economy, are given allowances on rates and tax to help us through. Additional funds for promotion and campaigns are imperative once the virus recedes and weto normal market conditions.Ian McMichael, business relationship manager with leading travel agent Oasis Travel, said it continues to be a very testing time, with many people expected to holiday at home rather than travel abroad.We had the collapse of Thomas Cook in November, then Flybe and coronavirus, he said.The confidence of people in the travel industry has stalled. New business has been falling.At the minute all the news is focused on the spread of the virus, but underneath all that there#s the economic impact.We#re all keeping our fingers crossed the spread can be slowed and eventually stopped.He added: We trust that, through time, people will travel again and that common sense will prevail.We have to remain hopeful that this is a short-term thing, but there are still places to gopeople want to get away. Meanwhile, Hospitality Ulster has established an Industry Response Group to monitor and support the sector in light of the ongoing impact.Brian Murphy, chair of the group, yesterday said: We are bringing forward a range of measures that could be implemented straight away to ensure that the sector and the economy can weather this current storm.We want to preserve and ensure the ongoing livelihoods of everyone in the hospitality sector.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Auditors from energy watchdog Ofgem have deemed this irregular spending, which is expected to hit a total of £m by the year  .In , there was a massive spike in applications to the scheme which the RHI inquiry was told was partly due to information being shared with the renewable energy industry.The then Department for Enterprise discussed possible tarf cuts to the scheme with firms in the biomass sector in the summer of that year.One civil servant told the inquiry  he thought there should have been less promotion of the scheme as officials already knew the cost for that year was twice the available budget. Ex-DUP MLA Jonathan Bell, then the minister responsible for RHI, told the inquiry that officials had not informed him of the spike in applications.It was told that one adviser said we could fill our boots as the scheme was being paid for from the Westminster budget, rather than Stormont#s.The forecast cost of the RHI scheme in   is £-m, thanks to cost controls which were put in place in . Before these changes were introduced the total cost was expected to be around £.bn, more than twice the scheme#s estimated cost of £m when it was set up in .Those who may face criticism in Sir Patrick#s report this week have already been given the opportunity to respond to his findings.The Monday following his publication, Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy will face questions from MLAs in the Assembly.In total, the Executive#s legal bill for the inquiry is estimated at £.m, with the overall cost of the nearly year-long investigation put at £.m.The RHI scheme was launched by then economy minister Arlene Foster in  and was meant to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources.But the low cost of the wood pellet fuel compared to the generous subsidies created a burn to earn scenario where boilers could be operated purely to make a profit from the scheme.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNewsDissident given le for killing prison officer Ismay undertook weapons trainingDissident killer Christie Robinson was hell-bent on killing a prison officer and underwent weapons training to prepare himself for murder.Irish League LivesIrish League Lives: Legendary keeper George Dunlop on calling time on his own glittering Blues careerBig Ivan Little takes a fair share of stick about his television gaffe many years ago when his vocabulary expertise failed him in his pronunciation of the word phenomenon.NewsDisgraced youth group leader jailed over park sex actThis is the disgraced former youth group leader who has been jailed after being caught on video committing a lewd sex act in front of three teenage girls. was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"SportOpinionCarl Frampton:My integrated education came through boxing and it allowed me to develop lelong friendships with CatholicsIn some ways, Northern Ireland has moved forward and in others it has stood still and that#s why I#m so passionate about the development of integrated education across the land. sundayleThug who attacked teen with samurai sword jailed for nine yearsA man who attacked a teenager with a samurai sword has been jailed for nine years.sundayleCourt translator appears in dock himself to admit growing cannabis plantsA Northern Ireland court service interpreter has appeared in the dock himself to admit growing cannabis. from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"sundayleSouth American student charged with causing death of Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless drivingA South American student has been charged with causing the death of a Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless driving.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLyra McKee#s heartbroken mum Joan dies ahead of first anniversary of daughter#s murder Derry Girls shirt insults Christianity, says Ian Paisley#s widowJudge dismisses #waste of time# injury claims backed by now struck-off Northern Ireland GPBelfast owners in big Cheltenham win as Ravenhill romps in at  Sex abuser made boy #do things#he got footballer names wrong, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was in his late s.He joined the Glentoran board in January  and served for six years until retiring due to ill health in July last year. In a statement, the club#s directors, management, players and staff expressed their deep regret and paid tribute. As grounds director, Kevin played a vital role in maintaining standards around the Oval, working with his Monday Club, a great team of volunteers who worked tirelessly each week, irrespective of the weather, to clean up the stadium and undertake all manner of ground maintenance and improvements.As Treasurer of the Internet GSC , he also held board responsibility for the Glentoran Superstore and Milk Bar. He was usually to be found in the Milk Bar before matches and will be sadly missed by his friends Ruth and Brian in the superstore and by Jodie in the Milk Bar, as well as by all his Monday Club connections.Kevin was also heavily involved with the club#s long-standing primary sponsor Bet McClean. He was always quick to help Glentoran in any way possible and his immense and selfless generosity was often put to the benefit of the club during some of the darkest points in the past decade, right up until the time of his retirement.Mr Milhench joined the board at a time when the club faced considerable financial dficulties. Their finances recovered after main sponsors Bet McClean gave a fresh injection of money.Chairman Terence Brannigan said at the time that McClean#s financial package and business support, which is ring-fenced to sit outside the sponsorship agreement, is integral to ensuring a successful resolution to our cashflow management and securing the long-term future of the club. Mr Milhench joined the board as part of the deal. He built up a successful business career and was a partner in Crothers and Milhench, a leading commercial estate agents.Ian Clarke, then a member of the advertising staff with the Belfast , worked closely with Mr Milhench in those days. He was a legendary figure in the commercial estate business and he was a man of great integrity and professionalism, he said.Glentoran director Mr Clarke added: Kevin helped Glentoran in so many ways. He worked quietly to solve problems and he was an inspiration to the club.Paul McClean, a partner with Bet McClean, said: Kevin worked closely with my father Al McClean for some  years, helping him to obtain premises for betting shops and other ventures. He was a very determined man and he had a good sense of humour. He was a real character. Mr Milhench is survived by his we Liz, son Rory, daughters Rachael and Sophie and by the wider family.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadBarney Eastwood: A boxing fan who brought the big-time fights back to Belfast Nigeria motorbike missionary Joe Mooney dies at Tributes to Orange Order#s Roy Kells who was respected businessmanObituary: William Martin, construction firm boss who made lasting contribution to architecture of BelfastDownpatrick optician John Doris optician was founding member of the SDLP,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was a great experience though and taught me how TV works.” After the show, Niall found himself in London, gigging and busking as he tried to make his way in the city’s competitive music scene.It was a city in which he found it tough to manoeuvre.“I wasn’t featured heavily in the show, so I didn’t get propelled into the spotlight.“After being in London for two years, I found myself at a bit of a standstill. I was finding it hard to meet people and a recording opportunity presented itself in Toronto.”The move across the Atlantic was aided by the fact that three of Niall’s brothers already lived in Toronto, and the Magherafelt native found a ready-made base in the city.He said: “I recorded three or four tracks within months of getting there.“I was getting my foot in the door a lot more easily with the contacts that my brother Killian made for me. “That was motivating, bearing in mind that in London, my main source of income was bar work along with busking and gigging.”In Toronto’s ‘closer-knit’ music community, Niall’s creativity blossomed, releasing his debut single – ‘Counterfeit’ - last month.“The music scene in Toronto is a lot more tailored for me. Because it’s a smaller community, I felt a lot more accepted.“I wrote ‘Counterfeit’ after I left the TV show. Initially it was an acoustic track, but the outcome has a pop, EDM vibe. “I was going through a relationship crisis and wonderingsomeone was truly into me or not, and questioning, as the hook says - is this legit, or is this counterfeit ”ExcitedHaving shaken the perception of X Factor graduates as cover artists, Niall hopes to have released an EP by the end of  and is excited about moulding his own sound.“The fact my music is hard to describe good, because it means I’ve managed to create my own sound, which I’m very happy about.”An exhilarating few years has meant opportunities to get back home to Mid Ulster have been limited, but Niall hints at an imminent .“I haven’t been home in about three years. I moved out when was  and I’ve been travelling around.

She said: “During the past three years I was always asked to speak at a large women’s day event in Berlin – this year I made sure I can be here to visit working women on the day.“We are proud to be part of a huge and growing number of activities all over the world around the th of March.”This group of textile workers in Dungiven have been carrying out the tradition for several years after it originated in the  song ‘Bread and Roses’.ProudMarion is especially proud that it was what she describes as her ‘sisters’ in the American mills who started the movement for women’s rights.She said: “I think as textile-workers today we should feel obliged to carry on the good tradition and at the same time be aware that International Women’s Day is as far from being just a ‘historic event’ as ever.“Pointing the finger at women’s problems and their struggles is as important as it was over a hundred years ago and celebrating their successes is making us happy. “There would be no right for women to vote, nothing like equal opportunities to find work, had it not been for the struggle of women of the generations before us,” said Marion. “Much has been achieved but much more has to be gained.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I had been lobbying for it before Christmas and been given positive soundings.“Now it has been delivered and thanks to the minister for her intervention as well.“The road had fallen into a fair bit of disrepair over the last number of years and needs new resurfacing, so I’m sure all the local residents there will be very glad to see it happening.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Following the decision, the applicant Clanmil Housing Association, said it was ‘very disappointed’ and would consider the full range of options moving forward. The application was for the erection of a four-storey building comprising of  two-bedroom apartments with rooftop amenity space, new access arrangements from Victoria Road, servicing and drop off provision, bin stores, cycle parking, landscaping and associated site works.

It sits m below the level of the Victoria Road and is boxed in by the River Foyle and perimeter walls with limited accessibility.

In the report it is noted that the primary objections to this development are no parking provision for residents and the adverse impact of congestion on Victoria Road caused by vehicles turning in and out of the site. googletag.cmd.push Developers proposed that there would be no parking on site, aside from operational parking, such as bin lorries and emergency services. CCTV monitoring and barrier operation would be automated for -hour operation. Planning officers said it will reinvigorate riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. The natural brick was chosen to better complement the stone finish of the historic Ice House - which sits adjacent - and provide a contemporary building as recognition of the industrial heritage of the wider area. Around two stories of the building would be visible from the Victoria Road and you would see the building from lands opposite on the Foyle Road. ‘Eyesore’ Speaking at the meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group raised a number of objections. He described the design as a horric brutalist East German style eyesore . He said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. Mr Hegarty believed Clanmil Developments would later apply for parking spaces. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in hazardous parking on Victoria Road. He envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. The local resident questioned how it would work allowing only one vehicle on to the site at a timeother vehicles were waiting. Mistakes have been made in the past with the BT building and others near Derry’s riverfront and he hoped the planning committee wouldn’t be remembered for this carbuncle. In response, an agent representing Clanmil said the development would go some way to reducing the housing demand in Derry with around , people on the waiting list. He refuted the suggestion of a future application for car parking saying that was absolutely not the case as there will be a zero parking solution on site and people would manage deliveries. Housing applicants would be made aware that there is no car ownership in this scheme. It is a highly accessible location with bus stops and train travel nearby, he added. The agent also contended that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. Congestion  Above: Artists impression of the building from Foyle Road. Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney who is a lorry driver said it would only take one heavy goods vehicleto block the Victoria Road and there would be massive tailbacks. “At the best of times it’s absolutely horrendous, it would only take one timed delivery to go wrong and traffic would be down past the Everglades Hotel.” He was assured there would be no disruption to traffic on the Victoria Road and told there’s enough room for one vehiclethe barrier was down. SDLP Councillor Angela Dobbins said she normally had brilliant things to say about Clanmil but on this occasion believed that the no parking clause discriminates against disabled applicants. “Disability Action will have a lot of issues with this development.” She added: “You’re saying, people can have an apartment with lovely views overlooking the Foyle as long as they’re not disabled or have complex needs.” In terms of parking on Duke Street and Spencer Road, she said it has a one hour parking restriction and askedresidents would be expected to park after pm. The Ballyarnett Cllr suggested Clanmil needed to be educated. While acknowledging a “housing deficit”, she said, people need quality housing, a quality le, quality access and disabled people should have the same rights as everyone . A Clanmil representative said a range of accommodation is needed and people with complex needs are allocated houses by the Housing Executive. Refused Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein Councillor Patricia Logue, said no distinction should be made between applicants and homes are allocated on a points-based system. “Those with the highest points are given first offer and refusal.” Disabled tenants may have carers who have to visit them three times a day. She warned that Clanmil could be taken to the Equality Commission over the scheme as some people need a car and can’t be treated dferently to those who don’t. Chair of the committee, Christopher Jackson, echoed her views saying those waiting years on homes shouldn’t have to choose between a home or their car. People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced the need for housing but believes it has to be done right. He said: “Representatives are trying to create a more accessible city and district for those with disabilities.” He wasn’t convinced about the aesthetics of the building and insisted that the beautul riverfront must be regenerated appropriately. “It looks to me like a car parking facility, I don’t mean to insult the designer.” Picking up on Cllr Logue’s point about carers, DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said people want letime homes but don’t know when their circumstances might change. Cllr Dobbins proposed that members do not accept the planning officers’ recommendation and refuse the application on grounds that it is contrary to access and movement and because of the design. “It does not allow people with disabilities to be included in a social housing scheme,” she concluded. Seven councillors voted in favour of her proposal, none against and there were four abstentions. The application was therefore refused. Afterwards a Clanmil spokesperson said: “Whilst we acknowledge the thinking of committee members, this city centre scheme could help address urgent housing need in the Waterside area. “This decision is therefore particularly bad news for families who desperately need a home. “We are considering the full range of options available to us and will decide on a way forward shortly.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Getting a renowned author to the school, and to get one such as Kelly is amazing.“Creativity is so important to students, and hopefully she will help inspire future young writers.”Describing how the students loved the many dferent formats the event took, the librarian continued: “The circus theme of the talk went down a storm. Students loved the real or fake freak show characters, with lots of gasps and laughs.“The hall fell wonderfully silent as Kelly read aloud from her book, leaving the pupils wanting more.“And, more important, she was happy to answer all the students questions and received a rapturous applause at the end.”Kelly McCaughrain was last year’s recipient of Children’s Books Ireland Book of the Year, the Eilis Dillon and Children’s Choice Awards  winner for her ‘Flying Tips for Flightless Birds’ novel.The author said she enjoyed her first journey to the north west.“I’m grateful to Mairead for asking me along here today and hope the students got as much fun and learning out of it as I did. “This is one of eight visits to schools across Northern Ireland over this week and it was lovely to visit Oakgrove Integrated College.

Studies also show that children aged five and up from the poorest income groups are twice as likely to be obese compared to their more advantaged counterparts. Serena Terry from Elemental said they were pleased to be part of the project.“This is a really exciting project for us that has huge transferable potential.“Elemental’s roots are firmly embedded in the communities that benefit from our social prescribing technology, so to get the opportunity to combine the capabilities of our  with the success of the SWEET programme and create an innovative new app is an incredible opportunity for us.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Amongst them, one person beamed you should write I couldn’t see anyone there!’, laughing like he had pulled a joke out of the Billy Connolly catalogue. So firstly, I want to assure you I won’t be taking that route. So,you are looking for a pun or two, you won’t be able to see any he... - dammit, let’s move on.The Invisible Man is a continuation of Hollywood’s new found love for reboots, with the classic novel by HG Wells first brought to the big screen back in , and this time we have Australian director Leigh Whannell taking the reins to give it a more modern touch.Whanell, who is attached to previous horror thriller block- busters such as Saw and Insidious as a writer, is well experienced in the genre, and from minute one, you know the film is in very good hands.The film tells the story of Cecilia, played by Elisabeth Moss.We are thrown straight into her unhappy world in an opening sequence that absolutely sets the tone for what is to come in terms of sheer tension.Cecilia has drugged her boyfriend Adrianinto a deep sleep in the early hours of the morning, and immediately sets about the process of getting the hell out of there.Which wouldnt be too dficult in a normal house, but a normal house it is not.She has to tread a gadget world obstacle course featuring security alarms, passwords and cameras in what I can only describe is a setting you would see in a Mission Impossible meets  type of film.Because it turns out, her boyfriend is a genius millionaire scientist control freak who has taken every precaution in an attempt to keep her in his clutches.After narrowly making her escape thanks to her sister Emily, Cecilia finally has some sort of freedom, but matters soon take a very strange turn. Shortly afterwards she is delivered the news that Adrian has killed himself by his lawyer brother, and that he has also left  million of his vast fortune to her. So hey, it’s not all bad.Except it is it’s very bad.Just when Cecilia believes her le is becoming a little bit rosier, events begin to spiral out of control in quite sinister ways. The oven suddenly goes on fire, her blanket is tossed around her bedroom, and she too ends up drugged. Adrian still very much has a pulse, and through his scientic and technical wizardy, he’s only gone and made himself invisible in a bid to make his ex’s le a living hell, with very tricks more brutal than the last. A new tinder account and going back on the market would have been less hassle, but, what do I know Now on paper, it all sounds a bit over the top, and in the hands of a lesser film maker I may have headed for the exit early.But this film delivers, for two reasons.Firstly, Whanell’s direction is flawless. He burrows into the quite effective horror trope of less is more, not resorting at all to endless jump scares that we see too often nowadays.His camera work excels in making the viewer completely uneasy throughout. There is one sequence where the camera is simply moving slowly from left to right while Cecila wanders the house alone during the night. Whanell plays with the audience superbly. He knows he has us in the palm of his hand. Where is Adrian  What will he do next Now in a role that requires the lead to portray terror, paranoia, rejection and abuse, Elisabeth Moss is outstanding.This is a film with very strong themes in some quarters it has been called the first big film of the #metoo movement in its representation of domestic abuse, and there is certainly symbols of that at dferent stages, with Moss carrying the flame in fine fashion as she attempts to defeat her own predator.She is utterly convincing in her despair as her world begins to fall apart from all angles, including one horrying turn of events that will have your jaw almost touching the floor - you have been warned. She shows all her acting props that were also on display in the hugely popular Handmaids Tale series.So,you’re a weirdo like myself and enjoy being disturbed and uncomfortable for two hours or so, then ‘The Invisible Man’ will be money well spent.Hey, we might even get a sequel, although, given the films climax, ‘I canny see that’ happening.I’ll stop now.The Invisible Man is now showing at Brunswick Moviebowl. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is the second time we have come here this season and really put it up to them.Of course you dont want to lose the game butyou are beat, you want to take some positives out of the games and we have plenty of positives to take out of that game.Stute needed just  seconds to take a surprise lead when Conor Tourish got on the end of a free-kick to send a looping header over Sean ONeill into the corner of the net.The Crues responded well with Paul Heatley seeing a curling effort from a David Cushley free-kick saved by Rory Brown but, soon after, Liam Walsh threatened for the visitors with a low shot which Sean ONeill pushed out before Rodney Brown made the ball safe.The sides continued to trade chances as the first half progressed. Evan Tweed was on hand to nod Michael Ruddys goalbound header clear while Walsh was twice more denied by ONeill.The introduction of Jordan Owens at half time had a signicant effect on the game as the striker proved a handful for the Institute defence. However, Crusaders got back on level terms with three minutes of the restart thanks to Philip Lowrys lashed finish from  yards after Jordan Owens had glanced a header into his path.Lowry might have doubled his tally soon after with a snapshot just past the post which had Brown beaten while, a few minutes later, the Stute keeper was forced to turn a fierce Rory Hale drive over the bar before blocking a Ruddy point blank header.Just before the hour, Heatley edged the Crues into the lead with what proved to be the winner with a competent finish after Tourish could only partially clear a long ball forward.Meanwhile, Crusaders assistant manager Jeff Spiers admitted that the introduction of Jordan Owens changed the game in the home teams favour.It was hard-fought,” he admitted. “They scored in the first minute and it took us  minutes to get going. The players were big enough to say we werent in the game, they werent doing things right, things werent working.We brought Jordan Owens on and he changed the game for us. Jordan came on and won a lot of headers and we got up the pitch another  or  yards and that made it easier. googletag.cmd.push TeamsCrusaders: ONeill, Burns, Lowry, McGonigle, Hale, Cushley, Ruddy, Brown, Heatley, McElroy, Dummigan.

But without any shadow of a doubt, the Maiden City’s most famous sporting son is John ‘Jobby’ Crossan.Crossan needs no introduction in these parts, but for the benefit of the uninitiated ‘Jobby’ Crossan was born in  at Hamilton Street in Derry.A precocious talent Crossan played as an inside forwardfor his hometown team, Derry City. His performances quickly garnered the attention of the top scouts from England, where thespoke of the -year-old wonder boy of Irish soccer … Irelands Jimmy Greaves. In August  he joined Sparta Rotterdam, before making his debut for Ireland against England at Wembley. But more of that game later.Crossan joined Standard Liegravege in , playing for the Belgian side in a European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid.Ian Rush may have famously described playing in Italy like being in a foreign country, but the Derry man negotiated this precarious new le abroad with all the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Fully focused: team captain Crossan leads out Manchester City, a club he joined after a successful spell at Sunderland. He moved on to Middlebrough in .  “It was great,” he enthused. “I thoroughly enjoyed it. I might have been lucky as a player but obviously I could play a wee bit. We learned a couple of languages and things. We were fortunate because we were winning matches, playing for trophies. Played against the top teams. We played Real Madrid in the semi-final of the  European Cup. We beat Rangers in the quarter-finals and I happened to get two goals.”In September  he moved to Sunderland, the start of a successful eight-year spell in England that also took him to Manchester Cityand Middlesbrough.In a European Championship qualier against Poland he scored one of the finest goals that Windsor Park has ever witnessed, a spectacular and acrobatic volley from  yards. And in a World Cup preliminary game Crossan scored three against Albania.He retired from the professional game in .But this isn’t a feature about a footballer, a special talent, a shopkeeper. That tale has been told before.This is a story about something more important than that.This is a story of friendship.Upon retirement Crossan faced the same dilemma as most professional sportsmen – how to fill the void.“Your whole world changes and you have to find something to fill that hole,” he explains. “I decided to come back home to Derry.”  PICTURED:Jobby Crossan in his Sunderland days. He was a prolic striker, scoring  goals in his  appearnces for the club between  and . That particular hole in his le was filled by a sports shop in Pennyburn he bought in the late s.“I bought the shop from a friend of mine, Raymond Daly. I thought I knew a bit about sport and this might do. I was entering a business I knew something about.” Jobby’s Sports Centre was born.You think of Barcelona’s great club motto – Meacutes que unclub . Well Jobby’s became more than a shop.Almost from its inception the place became a magnet for friends – old and new – to congregate to chat about football, to hotly debate, to blether, but above all  to laugh.This has been the case for over four decades now, and, like the proprietor himself, shows little sign of slowing down. Not dissimilar to the barber shop scenes in Coming To America, the cast in Jobby’s Sports Centre ies from day to day. But it never empties.Joe Quigg, Roger ODoherty, Donal Ferry, Bobby Ross were all in attendance on this particular wet and windy Monday morning.Charlie Johnstone calls, as does Wee Black Joe Doherty, Harry Nelis and Noel Crampsie.Joe Doherty comes down from Strabane to chew the fat on all matters cricket related.On Thursdays Jimmy Blair, an old friend from Jobby’s playing days, Harry O’Kane and Alfie Taylor make the trek up from Coleraine without fail.Sometimes there aren’t enough chairs to go round and the host perches himself on a low hanging shelf, when he’s not ferrying tea back and forth.  PICTURED: Old friends: Jobby Crossan catches up with another well-known local football figure Gerry Doherty. They huddle around a gas heater that owes them nothing, swapping stories, slagging, telling tall tales – all cloaked with that quintessentially Derry sense of humour, based on familiarity and gentle ribbing.“These boys would come into the shop and I thought they’d keep me on the straight and narrow. Turns out they just kept me on the narrow, and drank all my tea,” explains the host. “I go through three kettles a year!”Stories abound of local players, local teams, past and present. Their love of the game still undimmed, and the warmth among this band of brothers is evident.Football connects people. And sometimes those connections last a letime.Jobby, of course, has encountered more than most.“I’ve met three kings. The Swedish, Belgian and Norwegian Kings,” insists Crossan, very matter-of-factly.In , before his debut for Northern Ireland against England, he met Field Marshall Montgomery at Wembley.Crossan re-tells the occasion with a photographic recall.“You’re from my neck of the woods old spud ” says Crossan in a posh English accent to the mirth of his companions.“Nearby” replied Jobby. “You’re from Moville and I’m from Derry.”“Very good,” came back Montgomery, “Have a good game!”, again to enthusiastic laughter.“But that’s how it is in football. You run round making friends, and there was I from the Brandywell in Derry rubbing shoulders with a World War  general.”Jobby, of course, became great friends with George Best and the Derry man has nothing but fond memories of his old Manchester housemate and international team-mate.“Not for publication!” he says with a glint in his eye when asked did he have any stories he’d like to share.“George was one of the greats. There were good players about like Pele and Di Stefano, but George played in a league where they would kicks lumps out you. Players went out to nail him. But George was unique, a class of his own. He was more or less reared in my house in Manchester. We never got peace. One Friday afternoon we had two Miss Worlds in.”“George had them both!” jumps in Donal Ferry, again to roars of laughter.

Friendships play a key role in health and happiness – especially as we get older.The study wasn’t written about Jobby Crossan and his friends in the shop, but it might as well have been.Former East Stirling and Derry City player Bobby Ross would be the longest serving attendee at Jobby’s.Indeed, the two veterans had been playing in a weekly five-aside game at the Templemore Complex up until last year when a locked cartilage finally brought an end to the great man’s career at the age of .“Cut short in my prime!” Jobby quips, only half joking and ever the competitor.“I’ve been coming in here from the start,” says his friend Bobby in a soft Scottish accent that hasn’t left him despite living in these shores as long as the shop has been open.“Sure, I’ve nothing  to bloody well do!”“No, the craic’s good,” he continues, “the craic’s always very good in here. It soon passes an hour or two and you can get tea and coffee any time. And you might get an odd bun!”In a final poignant moment he confesses: “No, I’d be lost without it to tell you the truth.”Bobby Ross seems to speak for them all when he says these words.At the close of business, the gas heater is switched off, the lights dimmed and the shutter comes down once more.The front door key still refuses to play ball, especially in these dark nights, before it finally turns in the lock.But this is far from daily drudgery, it’s a labour of love.In the sweetness of friendship let there be conversation and laughter, for in the dew of the morning that is where the heart is refreshed and stays forever young.Jobby’s Sports Centre – more than a shop.

Clubs across Europe have this week taken the unprecedented action of playing games behind closed doors as the spread of the coronavirus continues across the world. Public gatherings across Europe and beyond have been banned in a bid to limit the spread of the virus, and this week discussions have been held at a national level to discuss the situation with regards public events in Ireland. The Football Association of Ireland met yesterday with the National League Executive Committee and the Professional Footballer’s Association of Ireland to discuss the impact of the Covid- outbreak on domestic football and established a steering group to monitor developments on a daily basis. An FAI spokesman said: “The meeting was a productive one and allowed us all to focus on the situation facing our National League clubs and players. We discussed atour serious concerns around Covid- and began to develop a contingency plan to help our clubs during this potentially dficult time.“We are currently gathering all financial data and working with the clubs and the players on the financial implications they face. Once we have a true understanding of this, we will be approaching Government and UEFA on behalf of the clubs to seek their support.”Devine however, is in no doubt what should happen in the coming weeks.“The one thing that we have in our league is time to play with,” he explained. “We shut down on the last week of October but maybe we dont have to do that this year. The one thing I am concerned about is the welfare of the clubs. Its fine whenever you have multi-million pound TV deals and sponsorship deals. We need the revenue of our support and every club in Ireland does. My worry is first and foremost the health of the players and the health of the supporters and secondly that we are sustainable to have a professional football club.“If it means postponing for a few weeks and looking after the safety of our players and fans, then so be it. The season doesnt start to next February or March so theres nothing set in stone. Were very fortunate that were not on any deadlines. For me, the safe option is to restrict but at the same time we know that we have a lot of football to be played this season and we have got to look at it that way and not panic.” googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Derry City boss Declan Devine has called for league postponement for the good of clubs, players and fansnecessary The English Premier League already postponed a game this week due to the spread of the virus and there are fears that the current campaign may have to be put on hold. No such pressure exists across the water however according to Devine.“We are in the fortunate position where there are no trophies getting handed out in five or six weeks time. Our trophies arent getting handed out for another nine or ten months. The panic doesnt need to set in here just yet. I think the health authorities have to take major decisions, but for me personally, whats right is right and I certainly dont want to be playing football in empty stadiums and clubs having to find money where its near enough impossible in dficult times to do.” googletag.cmd.push League actionIn the meantime, Devine and his staff must focus on tomorrow nights game against Sligo Rovers as the Candystripes look to bounce back from a poor display in Waterford last week. Despite a modestof four points from four games so far, City are favourites to beat a Sligo side who have lost all four games, but the City boss is expecting a big showing from Liam Biuckleys team.“I was impressed with Sligo against Rovers on Saturday,” he stated. I thought they were very unfortunate to lose to Finn Harps and I thought they were excellent against St. Pats. They have a lot of good players and there was a lot of close matches between us last year. Im expecting nothing other than a right, tough Northwest derby and Sligo will come here and enjoy playing on our pitch. No doubt they are coming here to put it up to us.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You could call it crucial.”Guitarist Johnny Fean takes up the story.“We’d been off the road for  years and as far as anyone knew, that was that.“But Derryman Jim Nelis, joined by two friends, Paul Callaghan and Stephen Ferris, designed and curated an exhibition in the Orchard Gallery.“We agreed to come up and open it.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies. This support has helped secure almost poundm of investment and is helping companies to create , jobs, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoIn direct response to Mr Hazzardrsquos comment that our focus is solely directed at investors in Belfast, in the last five years nearly % of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast and nearly % of Invest NIrsquos offers are to companies outside of Belfast.The spokeswoman said it was solely a companyrsquos decision on where it wished to visit and locate, based on its business needs.She added: ldquoThe vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations or, in some cases, the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our headquarters in Belfast which is why the Belfast figures are high.ldquoSteering an investor to locate in any one area that does not meet their requirements would be both counterproductive and damaging to Northern Irelandrsquos investment reputation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Late RUGBY.jpg","title":"Late Lansdowne try leaves ‘Hinch in relegation spot  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH suffered heartbreak on Saturday in their battle to avoid relegation from the ultra competitive AIL Division A as their Dublin opponents stole the result at the death, despite a much-improved Ballynahinch performance.The articial surface at Aviva Stadiumrsquos back pitch was the venue and the large travelling support braved Storm Jorge to roar their men on.It looked like turning into a famous victory until powerful Leinster Academy hooker Dan Sheehan drove over in the dying moments of a hard-fought match to seal victory for the home side and avenge their seven try thumping at Ballymacarn Park in November.Brian McLaughlin had made a few changes to his starting back line with Aaron Cairns moving into scrum half and Greg Hutley earning his first AIL start at out half. Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

Somewhere between pm and pm. Daddy late. Exhaustion is seeping from my limbs like slurry leaking from a tank.By The NewsroomWednesday, th March , : am\"\"Two planes racing high in the skyMy we is working late so I’ve got parental control. The school run. Feeding, dressing, washing, homework. Keeping my son entertained. Stories, dancing, games, wrestling, singing, reading. His constant need for stimulation burning my energy until all that’s left is a thin line of hazy black smoke.We’re in bed, covers pulled up tight to our chins. I’ve just finished the bedtime story and I haven’t got enough energy left to move him into his own room.I’m probably closer to sleep than him. He’s still talking, incessantly asking questions. Always the questions. He keeps looking over to seemy eyes are still open. They are, just. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Eventually he settles, slowing down like the toy from last Christmas when the batteries begin to fail. His little body begins to unwind and soften. He’s been silent for a while so I assume he’s gone. But then.‘Daddy ’ his voice heavy and slow with the immediacy of sleep.‘Yes son ’‘What will we dream about tonight daddy ’It’s a ritual of his. Usually the last question of the day. Some infantile notion that his dreams can be controlled. That our stories are of our own choosing. It gives him some comfort. I’m spent. I don’t have much more creativity to give. I force myself to think of something.‘Why don’t we dream that we’re two planes racing high up in the sky,’ I whisper.There’s a short silence, ashe’s pondering the notion. His answer is barely audible.‘OK daddy.’And then he’s gone. His eyes have become dark rings. Sometimes he emits soft groans, sometimes he grinds his teeth. His mouth slightly open, yellow skin. The slightest discolouration where the vein runs along the temple. I move the back of my hand along his face, old skin against young. Rough touching smooth.Despite my extreme state of tiredness I don’t feel that I can settle. I try to read a book but the words on the page seem stale. I put it down and just lie there. Watching my son.I notice some animation enter his body. He turns in his sleep. Sometimes he reaches for me with his hand or foot, asto check I’m still there. There’s the occasional strangled giggle or whine. I know that something’s going on in his brain and I’d love to be able to read him now. It occurs to me that this sums up parenting, trying to understand what’s going on in his head.I imagine some sort of disparate narrative is probably being pulled together within him as a dream. Something which makes sense to only him, and even then only at this moment. He most likely won’t remember it in the morning. It’s probably already gone forever. Dreams can’t be captured like butterflies.When he’s awake he talks often about dreams, the fleeting scraps he remembers. The ideas that fill his head through the day. He often gives us a small glimpse of the scope of his imagination. The ideas, conundrums, concerns, questions, concepts. He talks about the future too, Recently he asked us ‘When I’m a daddy, who will be the mummy ’He’s chosen his career already. He says he wants to be a doctor and a scientist. It’s noble and serious. Maybe he will. Maybe he’ll change his mind dozens of times.But tonight my mind is tired from wondering and wandering. I settle down, letting the first stages of sleep caress me.It’s been years since I’ve remembered any of my dreams. Perhaps my mind just doesn’t work that way anymore. I get little hints occasionally, a teasing feeling or emotion, but I can never put the mirror back together.My brain feels worn, broken down, empty. I suppose there was a time when I had the energy to grow ideas and to order them. Now I just look at my son. When he sleeps. When he watches the TV, chewing slowly on a biscuit. When he’s with his friends, his face flushed with joy. I’m content that he is the realisation of my ambitions. The stick that all of my dreams would be measured against. We both sleep well.The morning is welcome and everything seems to work. My we is back home and my son is excitedly telling her all his adventures from the day before. The games, the dancing, the dream about the two planes racing high up in the sky.It’s a school and work day which brings its own feeling of urgency, a sense that things have to be done. But it’s also Friday and the sweetness of the weekend and the time together is close, reflecting onto all of us.I hurriedly get my son into his unorm and coat and he doesn’t really bother to complain. I brush his hair and clean his face. I take him outside, it’s definitely still winter but the weather seems more benign this morning. I’m fiddling with the straps of the car seat when he lets out an excited yell.‘Look daddy! Look in the sky!’I gaze upwards. There’s a flinty blue horizon and the beginning of a sunrise over the roofs of the distant houses, just a promise at this hour. And above, two clear lines cut across the sky like the silvery trails of flat slugs. They are parallel, even, moving away. At the edge of the contrails I can just about make out two aircraft that appear tinier than toys.My son is jumping up and down.‘Daddy, it’s our dream! It’s our dream! Two planes racing high up in the sky!’I lt him into his chair, checking the straps are secure. He’s still straining his neck to watch the distant planes. I warm the car and slowly reverse it down the driveway.‘You see daddy, I told you, dreams do come true.’‘You’re right son. You’re absolutely right.’\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The additional £m, whilst welcome, will “not come close” to addressing the challenges facing NI, he said.There will also be a fear that business rate waivers in England will not be extended to Northern Ireland, but he welcomed the decision to cover  days of statutory sick pay in light of coronavirus fears.UUP leader Steve Aiken welcomed the cut in interest rates but also lamented the failure to abolish Air Passenger Duty for NI. The Executive must now decide whether coronavirus mitigation measures will be “passed on in full” to the NHS, small businesses and the hospitality sector, he said, adding that there is a real opportunity for NI to urgently improve its infrastructure.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood MP said the budget is “a clear indication” that the government is preparing for a severe economic shock as a result of coronavirus. Severing our “largest trading relationship” at this time would represent “an act of grievous political self-harm” he added, calling on the government to request an emergency extension to the Brexit transition period. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was right the government helps manage the impact of coronavirus, he said, but the “looming economic shock masks the even deeper financial and other consequences flowing from Brexit”.The Ulster Farmers’ Union said the most crucial outcome for farmers was the chancellor’s decision to retain the relief on red diesel. Federation of Small Business policy chair Tina McKenzie welcomed steps in the budget to ‘boost confidence’. “Covering the cost of statutory sick pay, as well as emergency measures for the self-employed, are particularly welcome,” she said.“Removing the minimum income floor for those on Universal Credit will bring help to those working hard to keep their businesses going.”Ann McGregor, CEO of NI Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also welcomed access to loan schemes and deferral of tax payments.

Please try again later.Submitting...His report will be published at pm on Friday. Sir Patrick will make a public statement, but will not be taking questions from journalists.Initially Sir Patrick did not appear to want to partake in a widespread ‘representations process’ – or ‘Maxwellisation’ as it is also known – because it inevitably delays the end of a public inquiry. In the case of Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry into the Iraq War, the Maxwellisation process led to widespread public and political criticism after the report was delayed more than five years between the final oral evidence and the publication of the report.In the final week of oral inquiry hearings in December , Sir Patrick said that he did not intend to send routine Maxwellisation letters, saying: “I am not in favour of a routine Maxwellisation – it takes up too much time and as this is a public inquiry, expenditure has to be seen [to be] justied for the public.”However, that position changed last year in what some sources say was an attempt to head off the possibility of any witness attempting to judicially review the inquiry.On the final day of inquiry hearings in December , Sir Patrick warned that it is “very likely that some iniduals and or bodies may be subject to quite signicant criticism in light of actions or omissions relating to the scheme” but he stressed his “complete determination” to ensure that no one is “treated unfairly”.Since it was set up more than three years ago, the inquiry has issued  notices under the sweeping powers of Section  of the Inquiries Act  which allow it to compel answers from witnesses and forces them to turn over evidence relevant to RHI. That process has seen the inquiry accumulate a vast pile of . million pages of evidence. At its height, the inquiry team had  members including the chairman and  members.The total bill for the inquiry itself is expected to be published tomorrow. However, by last year the full bill for taxpayers – taking in the fact that witnesses’ legal costs were overwhelmingly publicly funded – was already more than £ million, and has risen since then.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

He still refuses to give us the statistics on wrongful deportations and the associated costs.On a dferent note, it was a pleasure to welcome the Welsh Combat Regiments to Parliament this week for an annual reception.

Lear Ltd., for a change of use of a warehouse and yard at the rear of  Windsor Road to a refrigerated store for milk and a depot for vehicles.Mr Lear told the Council: ldquoI have been trading in the area for about four years in which time my business has grown too big for the premises in Queens Road.ldquoTo provide a proper service to the general public it is essential that the premises should be as close as possible to the customers and the site at the rear of Windsor Road would fulfil this need.Mr Lear said that although the milk floats would leave the depot early in the morning, there would be no noise problem with the silent electric motors and modern plastic crates.Members agreed to support the planning application which will be determined by the County Council, subject to safeguards restricting noise. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this.

If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When askedthey supported the construction of a dam,  per cent said they did not.The same number advocated for ldquonature friendly solutions to flood management.Local engineer David Bacon proposed pumping water from the lower end of the Cadoxton, where the flood risk is highest, onto the Sully Moors.Andrew Peterken, a Dinas Powys resident whose property is at risk of flooding, argued that natural flood management solutions should be trialled and the situation reviewed at a later date.The public have been invited by Natural Resources Wales to offer their feedback on the Outline Business Case until Friday, March .For more information, visit: naturalresources.wales about-us our-projects flood-scheme-projects dinas-powys-flood-scheme appraisal-of-dinas-powys-flood-scheme-options  langen. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We wanted to put something in the paper to thank this man and his we.“ He must live somewhere in NI.”She also wants to thank all her family and friends for the gts and cards which they had sent to Ryan.The Calvert family had been very upset at the ‘serious neglect’ of Ryan on February  when he was left alone on the private bus, hired by the Education Authority.Mr Calvert had taken Ryan, as usual, to the bus close to their home at Portadown at .am. Ryan was supposed to have been taken to the Learning Support Centre. But his father later discovered he didn’t arrive until noon that day. “We were left in shock,” Mr Calvert said.A spokesperson for the Education Authority commented: “We can confirm we are investigating the circumstances surrounding an incident on a contracted private hire route involving a pupil attending Edenderry Primary School on Wednesday  February . On becoming aware of this incident, we took immediate action as the safety and well-being of pupils is our primary concern.“We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously and have offered our unreserved apology to the pupil and their parents. As this matter is under investigation no further comment can be made as it may be prejudicial to the process.” Edenderry PS principal Stephen Doyle said they were ‘very concerned about this child being left on the bus’. He had requested an investigation.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1583928112943.jpg--coronavirus__omagh_cinema_to_leave_every_second_seat_empty.jpg?158392811600","title":"coronavirus omagh cinema to leave every second seat empty ","story":"Omaghs Omniplex cineman facility is introducing a seat separation policy in response to coronavirus.In a bid to prevent the spread of Covid-, every second seat will be left unoccupied in a checkerboard pattern.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
