With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th.

MailOnline has requested further clarification from his representatives this morning.   Becker, 50, was made bankrupt last summer by a London court over an undisclosed sum he has owed a private bank since 2015. It ordered that his assets be disposed of to meet his debts, leading to speculation that he had squandered a personal fortune once estimated at £100million.According to German newspaper Bild, the 62-acre estate in Majorca – which is on the market for £9,135,000 – has stood empty for the past few years.Fresh turf marks spot where poisoned Russian spy and his...My evil ex tortured and killed her au pair because of me:...Share this articlePictures show its 90ft swimming pool covered in green algae and the lawns around it long and parched. Becker bought the estate with his former wife Barbara in 1997 but has been trying to sell it for a decade. It boasts a main villa, stables, a helicopter pad, four guest houses, staff accommodation and a tennis court made from the same surface used on hard courts at the Australian Open.  Berres says he plans to give the empty £13 million villa near the rural town of Arta in north-east Majorca a new lease of life - and claims to have already cut weeds and picked up rubbish around the property along with his hippie commune friendsA real estate lawyer in the region said it can take two years to clear out squatters.   Berres, thought to be a 44-year-old former carpenter, has moved into the plush home along with a with a number of helper friends.The group, calling themselves the ‘Intergalactic Auxiliary And Rescue Command’– walked through an unlocked gate at the former Wimbledon champion’s holiday home last weekend. Berres said the group see themselves as ‘house-rescuers on behalf of higher powers’, adding: ‘When houses are open, we go in, start to revive everything, to make everything clean. We want to create a lovable place.’  He added: ‘No one has been here for years. But I felt immediately welcome here. This is a real rough diamond that needs to be honed.’He has wasted no time sharing videos of himself wandering through the palatial grounds and sunbathing.          Berres, who moved to Majorca in 2014 and is understood to have lived in several \u0027abandoned\u0027 houses on the island after time in a caravan, told German press he had \u0027big projects\u0027 for the 31,000-square foot propertyFilming himself walking through the now unkempt grounds, Berres says: \u0027It\u0027s like nobody loved this place.\u0027How can it come to this, I ask, that something like this is a habitat for wasps, geckos and spiders. Something\u0027s gone wrong there. Someone\u0027s listened to the wrong advice.\u0027  Becker is said to have earned in the region of £100million throughout his career, but was declared bankrupt in June last year over a £3.3million debt - forcing him to abandon the plush Spanish property.

In this experiment, Alice (pictured above) and Heidi, who live in South East London, carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds. The worst offender was a cash machine at Berlin airport, where both twins withdrew €200          For every transaction, it worked out more expensive to pay in pounds.In the worst case, the difference was almost 10 per cent — which means you would lose £100 if you spent £1,000 over the course of your holiday.Most restaurants, shops and cash machines overseas give tourists the option to pay in sterling — this is known as dynamic currency conversion. It can be tempting as it means you’ll be able see straight away how much the transaction will cost you in pounds and pence. But the conversion rates used by foreign firms almost always work out as more expensive than if you had paid in the local currency and left it to your own bank or credit card provider to convert the cost.UK banks typically use the exchange rate offered by Visa or Mastercard, which is as near to a perfect rate as you can get.In this experiment, Alice and Heidi, who live in South East London, carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds. Even in the best cases, the extra cost of paying in pounds was still 3.1 per cent of the total bill.The worst offender was a cash machine at Berlin airport, where both twins withdrew €200. Heidi chose to be charged in euros, which worked out as £177.44 at the Mastercard exchange rate.          Starling Bank’s research also showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a typical 2.99 per cent fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currencyAlice, on the other hand, accepted the offer to convert the €200 to pounds there and then using the foreign bank’s rate. This ended up costing her £195.18 — an extra £17.74 or 10 per cent.When the sisters later split a €43.86 bill for cocktails at their hotel, the difference was far smaller. Heidi paid her €21.93 bill in euros, which worked out at £19.45. Alice paid in pounds, costing her £20.06 — an extra 61p or 3.1 per cent.The next day, the twins went shopping and each bought a scarf, a pair of trainers and a top from three different stores. Heidi paid in euros, spending €7.95, €69.10 and €9.99 — which worked out at £7.05, £61.30 and £8.86 respectively.Alice again converted her bills to pounds and ended up paying £7.28, £63.31 and £9.15. So altogether she paid an extra £2.53.After lunch — where, unusually, they weren’t offered the option of paying in pounds — they visited the Museum of Berlin, which had a €12 entry fee. Accepting the on-the-spot conversion cost Alice £11.05, while Heidi paid only £10.64.Finally, at the airport the following morning, the twins bought some €12.50 chocolates from a duty-free shop. Heidi, as usual, paid in euros, which later worked out at £11.09. After agreeing to pay in pounds, the chocolates cost Alice £11.70 — an extra 61p or 5.5 per cent.In many of these examples the difference between paying in pounds and euros is just a few pence. But over the course of a holiday this can add up. In fact, the rip-off is estimated to cost British tourists around £500million every year, according to travel money firm FairFX.At the end of the Berlin trip, Alice had spent a total of £317.73 — an extra £21.90 compared to Heidi.While this isn’t an enormous sum, it is an easy saving to make — all it requires is that you push a different button on the card machine. Experts say that some businesses are failing to give tourists a choice and automatically convert the bill into pounds.A spokesman for Starling Bank says: ‘This isn’t always intentional as sometimes shop assistants or waiting staff don’t understand and presume they are doing their customers a favour by selecting to pay in pounds for them. But in line with the law, cardholders should be given a choice before they pay.’Starling Bank’s research also showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a typical 2.99 per cent fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currency. FairFX is offering This is Money readers a free prepaid Mastercard currency exchange card.

Now, however, she has ‘locked-in’ syndrome. Her alert and able brain is marooned in an immobile body her mouth cannot articulate her thoughts.I imagined her condition would also have deprived her of humour and (as she cannot speak) the capacity to express it outwardly. Surely to be rendered mute and motionless must be the worst kind of imprisonment?But by some quirk of nature, and against all logic and reason, Shirley can still physically laugh. And she does so often and infectiously, bringing joy to all those around her.‘Shirley is definitely the happiest person I know,’ says one of her round-the-clock carers, Valerie Griffiths. ‘There are lots of lively and hilarious episodes with her. We laugh all the time. This isn’t a sombre job. Actually, it’s uplifting.’          Shirley, pictured with her father Henry Dennis on her wedding day aged 20 in 1980More than that, Shirley, 57, tells me — writing slowly on a computer operated by a sensor she works with her right cheek — that she is happy in some ways actually happier than she was in her former, able-bodied life.It is a startling admission and I ask her to explain. The answer takes shape slowly as she types.‘My former life was busy, noisy, pressurised and stressful, and now it’s quiet, peaceful and calm, with more time to fully appreciate life,’ she writes. ‘I’ve never really considered it before but I probably do feel liberated from the trappings of a normal working life.‘I certainly appreciate other people more and have time to fully enjoy the important things like being with friends and family. I think I feel a different kind of happiness now, born out of contentment.’It is an extraordinary response. Few of us who have the liberty to move and talk can think about being deprived of these faculties without utter horror. But Shirley has astounded, delighted and humbled me in the few weeks I have known her. She is, quite frankly, an extraordinary inidual.We spent several weeks swapping emails — she returning eloquent, thoughtful and often witty responses to my questions — before I visit her.I ask Shirley if she has ever, in her darkest days, succumbed to despair ever considered taking her own life.Her answer is emphatic. ‘Not even for a split second,’ she tells me. ‘My view is that a limited life is better than no life at all. However, I respect the views of those who differ. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.‘There were many dark moments during the first year,’ she concedes. ‘I cried a lot. But as my level of acceptance increased, so did my level of happiness.’She lives in a village on the edge of Dartmoor, Devon, in a specially-adapted bungalow next to a residential care home. Light streams through the French doors. There is a view of fields, and her cats, Smudge and Tigger, stretch languidly in the sun.  Shirley, pictured left on her wedding day in 1980 and right, aged 36, graduating from the University of the West of England in Bristol was not expected to survive her strokeShirley remains married to her husband, whom she won’t name (‘he’d kill me!’) but who lives nearby and visits often. He still runs the family farm on which she grew up.They didn’t have any children, which, she says, is not a regret because she did not want any in the first place.A good and loyal wife still, she respects his privacy. Questions as to how he copes with their situation, the nature of their relationship, whether he has found someone else, and whether she would be accepting if he did, are batted away with good humour but certitude. The no-nonsense, ruddy country girl has not gone away.‘I still love my husband,’ she says. ‘He makes me laugh. I miss him not being with me but I accept he couldn’t care for me. It would be a very demanding job. But it’s important that I’m still married.’ And that is the end of the conversation.Her constant companions are her carers. Valerie, 58 — cheerful and calm with a lilting Welsh accent — has been one of two regular carers for five-and-a-half years and works for two weeks, staying overnight in the bungalow’s bright spare bedroom, then has two weeks off when another carer comes.Extra carers from the adjacent home come in three times daily to help dress, wash and feed Shirley.She is still fiercely independent in many ways, however. She shops for clothes and groceries on the internet and manages her own care.          Shirley, aged 13 in school‘She types notes to us each day about food portions, heating, what she’d like to wear the positioning of the bed — things like that,’ explains Valerie.‘Are you allowed to say if you don’t like a carer?’ I ask Shirley. She laughs. ‘I’ve done so loads of times,’ she says. ‘I’ve sent carers away! I look for humour, patience no fuss.’It is a measure of her tenacity and determination that since she became locked in she has taken two Open University degrees — a Bachelor’s and a Master’s in social sciences with politics.The graduation certificates are framed and proudly displayed on the wall.For four hours a day, Shirley studied with the help of computer software that read books aloud to her. Exams were a test of endurance: Shirley was permitted four hours for every one hour of a usual exam.This meant standard three-hour exams — completed at her home in the presence of an invigilator — took 12 hours and were spaced over three days.I ask if the feeling of triumph when she graduated was magnified because of the effort involved. ‘Definitely!’ She smiles.She is an only child and her mum, who died three years ago, never properly recovered from the shock of seeing her daughter so severely disabled. ‘It was very hard for her,’ says Shirley, with understatement.Her dad Henry, who turned 90 in April, visits twice weekly and takes her on outings, usually to a park in Okehampton, and sometimes out to lunch. She enjoys the occasional vodka and orange. Eating and tasting food — which she is fed in pureed form — is also a positive pleasure that might have been denied to her had she not been so determined to learn to swallow.‘After my stroke I was fed through a peg-tube direct into my stomach,’ she remembers.‘I wasn’t even able to swallow saliva and I was told that I’d never be able to swallow. But with practice, initially through illicit consumption of chocolate buttons at the rehab centre where I went after hospital, I reached my goal of being able to eat.’Who fed you the forbidden chocolate buttons? I ask, amused. ‘My husband!’ she says. ‘I suppose you could have choked?’ I remark.She raises her eyes upwards, her signal for yes, and types: ‘But he didn’t dare say no!’          Despite her condition, she has successfully completed two Open University degrees - a Bachelor\u0027s and a Master\u0027s in social sciences with politics Grit and tenacity have always been strong components of Shirley’s personality — she would joke that she is actually ‘stubborn and awkward’ — and neither of these qualities has diminished since her stroke.She says she often thinks about her old life — not with wistful regret, but with pleasure that she has good memories to draw upon — and about the job she loved, her marriage and the farm.Her leisure time used to be full of activity. She loved aerobics, socialising with friends and, having grown up on her parents’ farm, the countryside and walking were in her blood.History remains a passion. Holidays in her old life were spent travelling to places ‘that had a bit of history about them’. Today, she admits the logistics are tricky — every outing assumes the complexity of a military manoeuvre — so she doesn’t venture far from home for more than a few days.In her old life she qualified as a solicitor through sheer hard graft. Having joined a law firm in Okehampton as an office junior straight from school at 17, she became a secretary, then, after a few years, studied to become a legal executive by correspondence course, while doing her day job.Finally she qualified in law in 1997 — her area of expertise was residential conveyancing — studying at weekends and passing her exams while still running a busy legal practice.          Shirley learned how to swallow again after being smuggled chocolate buttons by her husband while in a rehab centreEverything came to an abrupt halt one awful Sunday morning in December 2002. Shirley recalls: ‘I woke up with a splitting headache and, when I tried to get out of bed, I found that I had severe vertigo so went back to bed and stayed there much of the day.‘I felt a bit better late afternoon, and as I thought that some fresh air would do me good, I got up and went down to the farm for a walk.‘While I was there, I thought I would make myself useful and feed a few of the animals. But, while I was doing it, I felt a bit dizzy so sat down on a pile of hay.‘It was obviously then that I had my stroke, because the next thing I knew I was coming around in intensive care a couple of weeks later.’Much of what happened during her four weeks in hospital is obliterated from her memory. However, during the ensuing 16 months in a neurological rehab centre, the implications of the stroke hit her. ‘I didn’t handle it well. I cried a lot,’ she says of those early days.I wonder if the terror of being unable to communicate was her worst fear, but she explains that even in the early weeks she learned to raise her eyes to signal ‘yes’ and look down to indicate ‘no’.Communication with Shirley is necessarily a laborious process. If she is not at her computer, she spells out words with the help of an alphabet board, building them up painstakingly by blinking when her listener indicates the correct letter on the board.Inside, of course, her active brain is buzzing her sentences ready-formed into eloquent expressions of thought.I cannot imagine, I say, how frustrating it must be when strangers assume she does not understand them, because of her disability, and talk to her carer instead.‘At first it annoyed me,’ she admits. ‘But I’ve come to accept it as inevitable. Most people have never even heard of locked-in syndrome, let alone know what it is, so don’t know what to expect and can only go on appearance.‘I occasionally get frustrated when people don’t understand what I’m trying to say, but generally I’ve accepted my condition. It happened, I can’t turn the clock back, so I’ve just got to make the best of it.’Acceptance. It seems to be the key to Shirley’s happiness. That, and her obdurate refusal to ever capitulate.When she came out of rehab, it was obvious she would need professional care. Medics favoured a nursing home, but Shirley, then just 42, did not agree. ‘I’m not at all suited to institutional living,’ she says. ‘I’m far too independent.

Her little bungalow, in a small assisted living complex next to the care home, gives her both a degree of autonomy and the comfort of knowing that, aside from her regular carer, there is constant support at hand. ‘Thankfully,’ she adds, ‘apart from the occasional bit of cramp or backache that everyone gets, I’m not in pain.’Because Shirley has such a rare capacity for joy, a visit to her home leaves you filled with an unexpected optimism that even the bleakest of personal tragedies can be turned into triumph.

I laugh at just about anything and I generally laugh loudly.

Terrified shoppers flee as...Share this article‘But, from the first day he joined the school, it became evident that he had a talent for football that was way beyond his years.’Thirteen years and 37 England caps later, Raheem Shaquille Sterling’s success on the football pitch continues to be as stratospheric as his all-too-regular failures off it.          Sterling, pictured here with his girlfriend Paige Lee Hansel, is part of Gareth Southgate\u0027s squad to travel to Russia next month for the World CupOn one hand, the rise of the 23-year-old star represents an old-fashioned sporting fairy tale: a working-class boy who came to the UK as an infant and, through talent and hard graft, has achieved fame and fortune beyond the wildest dreams of his immigrant single mother.A key figure in Manchester City’s title-winning season, scoring 18 goals in the process, the £200,000-a-week forward will be cheered by a nation when he takes the field at the coming World Cup.Yet, on the other hand, this supposed role model has for far too long allowed himself to be defined by acute lapses in judgment that — in the eyes of many critics, at least — have turned him into a symbol of the amorality that is today at the heart of the so-called Beautiful Game.Recent years have seen court appearances, at least one reported tryst with a prostitute and secret dates with a Playboy model who was most certainly not Paige Lee Hansel, the long-suffering fiancee and mother of his youngest child Thiago.  Sterling has been photographed taking \u0027Hippy Crack\u0027, left, and with a shisha pipe, rightOn social media, where he shares images and videos of his gaudy mansion in Cheshire, purchased for £3.1 million in 2016, high-end cars (he’s said to own seven — one for each day of the week) and collection of bling wristwatches, he’s also been filmed smoking and inhaling a mind-altering intoxicant known as ‘hippy crack.’In this ignoble tradition came yesterday’s somewhat bizarre controversy over Sterling’s decision to get a large new tattoo — of an M16 assault rifle.He showed off the design, running down the lower half of his right leg, in a photo shared with his 3.6 million followers on Instagram on Monday.It was taken at England’s training ground in Staffordshire as players assembled to start preparations for the World Cup, which begins in just over a fortnight.Critics promptly condemned it as provocative and irresponsible, pointing out that more than 60 people have been killed by gun and knife violence in London this year alone and that similar weapons have been used in countless recent mass shootings in the U.S.Branding it ‘sickening’, ‘disgusting’ and ‘totally unacceptable’, the lobby group Mothers Against Guns called for him to be dropped from the England side.Lucy Cope, whose son was shot dead outside a London club, said: ‘He’s supposed to be a role model, but chooses to glamorise guns.’Last night, her words were echoed by the father of Damilola Taylor, who was stabbed to death in a street attack aged ten.Richard Taylor told The Sun: ‘Young people look up to footballers. Sterling hasn’t displayed the discipline we expect. He should be reprimanded and made to apologise to victims’ families.’Iffat Rizvi, who runs the Starr anti-guns campaign, said: ‘This is disrespectful to young people who lost their lives.’      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/17/1EE3252000000578-0-image-m-63_1527609689005.jpg","title":"Royal Sophie launches foul mouthed defence disgraced Kids Company founder","story":"    Actress Sophie Winkleman (pictured with husband Lord Frederick Windsor), Prince Michael of Kent\u0027s daughter-in-law, launched a foul-mouthed defence of the colourful former charity boss Camila BatmanghelidjhLady Frederick Windsor tells me: \u0027They don\u0027t tell the truth.

To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.          Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski          When one user called Barr\u0027s tweet racist, she proclaimed that \u0027Muslims r NOT a race\u0027           Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend her controversial joke, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027          She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027      A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne. I told you. So,\u0027 author Roxane Gay added, to which Julianne Moore replied: \u0027Yes you did. #FireRoseanne.\u0027 Reverend Al Sharpton also criticized the comedian and called on ABC to \u0027take action now\u0027. \u0027The comparison by Rosanne Barr on ABC of Former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable,\u0027 he tweeted. Tomi Lahren was a rare prominent conservative voice to hit out at Roseanne. \u0027What Roseanne said was wrong,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she knows that. She made a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why fellow conservatives are playing mental gymnastics trying to justify it. Come on. Wrong is wrong.\u0027 Only Rosie O\u0027Donnell appeared to lend some support to Roseanne, writing that she loved her \u0027quite a bit\u0027. \u0027The comment Roseanne tweeted was racist and childish and beneath her best self,\u0027 O\u0027Donnell wrote. \u0027She has apologized. Twitter is a dangerous place.\u0027     Many Twitter users called out Barr and asked ABC how they could continue to order episodes of her eponymous show (pictured)          Barr came under fire on the very night the revival of Roseanne premiered in April when she accused Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg of giving a \u0027Nazi Salute\u0027.Barr swiftly took the tweet down and claimed that she had seen a \u0027doctored\u0027 image of Hogg. But internet sleuths found a grab of Barr\u0027s original tweet, which revealed she was commenting on picture of Hogg raising his fist at the March For Our Lives rally. That same week, Barr also made headlines when she tweeted about a bizarre right-wing conspiracy theory claiming Trump broke up a pedophile ring created by Democratic politicians.  Barr claimed that it was Trump who had freed \u0027so many children held in bondage to pimps all over this world\u0027.           In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope UC Davis gets nuked\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel\u0027He has broken up trafficking rings in high places everywhere. notice that.

The reason #DEMOCRATS aren\u0027t approving #Sessions is bc he will prosecure #HRC – and make arrests over PedoGate RT THIS!! WAKE UP!!\u0027Barr was slammed and derided for the tweets. She later apologized for mentioning child trafficking and said Twitter was \u0027not the place for it\u0027. In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope all the jews leave UC Davis and then it gets nuked!\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel           In 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rightsIn 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rights. \u0027Women do not want your penises forced in their faces or in private bathrooms.

I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.\u0027             Jarrett\u0027s faith wasn\u0027t the only conspiracy theory Barr tried to push on Tuesday. She also claimed that Chelsea Clinton was married to the nephew of George Soros.

Clinton is married to Marc Mezvinsky. Meanwhile, George Soros has two sons named Peter and Jeffrey Soros.But Chelsea Clinton herself was quick to respond to Barr, writing: \u0027Good morning Roseanne - my given middle name is Victoria. I imagine George Soros\u0027s nephews are lovely people. I\u0027m just not married to one.\u0027Barr first apologized to Clinton directly, tweeting: \u0027Sorry to have tweeted incorrect info about you! Please forgive me!\u0027 \u0027By the way, George Soros is a nazi who turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps \u0026amp stole their wealth-were you aware of that?\u0027  In a separate tweet, Barr wrote: \u0027I\u0027m sorry-Chelsea Clinton IS NOT married to a nephew of George Soros-i apologize for the mistake!\u0027 A spokesman for Soros has since vehemently denied Barr\u0027s claims, calling the comments \u0027insulting\u0027 and an \u0027affront to his family\u0027.           Much like its revival, Roseanne was an almost instant success when it premiered in 1988 and quickly became the umber one show on television It also turned Barr, who previously performed stand-up comedy on Johnny Carson\u0027s Tonight Show, into a household name. The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties.   The show  tackled episodes that focused on taboo topics for the times like homophobia, abortion, teen pregnancy, masturbation, and domestic abuse.Barr, who has a lesbian sister and a gay brother, also made sure to feature a number of LGBT characters on the show. One episode of the show even featured Roseanne contemplating whether or not she should have an abortion, while others discussed previously taboo topics like masturbation.           The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties - such as issues paying bills and homophobia The show won both Barr and Laurie Metcalf, who played her sister, respective Emmy Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. It also won the prestigious Peabody Award in 1992. ABC announced in May 2017 that it planned to do a revival of the beloved series, which aired in March of the following year. The news garnered controversy from the beginning when it was revealed Roseanne would return as a pro-Trump grandmother. It also featured episodes that include her husband Dan, played by John Goodman, losing his job to an illegal immigrant and Roseanne\u0027s fears after finding out her new next-door neighbors are Muslim.

By the time he sold it in 2006, it was worth £6.7billion.  Mrs Bertarelli\u0027s marriage to the wealthy tycoon was an extraordinary leap up to the top of the social ladder for a middle-class girl from Stone in Staffordshire.She wrote Black Coffee shortly after meeting her husband in Sardinia, who was her inspiration for the song, in 1997.   Mrs Bertarelli comes from a wealthy family who owned a successful pottery businessShe was dining with friends at their villa on the Sardinian coast when she was mesmerised by the charismatic tycoon sitting at the table. Then 26, the  former beauty queen had gone on holiday to recover from her recent break-up with boyfriend Damian Aspinall, the heir to his family\u0027s casino fortune.  Her friends introduced her to their guest, Ernesto, who had left his 128ft yacht Vava down the coast to join the dinner party and within three years, they were married.Kirsty married Ernesto in July 2000 in a marquee in Geneva and sang at her own wedding. They now have three children, Chiara, Falco and Alceo.In an interview with The Mail on Sunday in 2008, shortly after she and her husband entered The Sunday Times Rich List at number six, with a fortune of £5.65billion, she spoke about her marriage and insisted wealth hadn\u0027t changed her.            Kirsty Bertarelli\u0027s yacht, the largest ever built in the UK was a 40th birthday present\u0027I feel terribly fortunate to have such a wonderful husband and fabulous lifestyle,\u0027 she said.\u0027But I\u0027ve always appreciated everything in life.

In this experiment, Alice (pictured above) and Heidi, who live in South East London, carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds. The worst offender was a cash machine at Berlin airport, where both twins withdrew €200          For every transaction, it worked out more expensive to pay in pounds.In the worst case, the difference was almost 10 per cent — which means you would lose £100 if you spent £1,000 over the course of your holiday.Most restaurants, shops and cash machines overseas give tourists the option to pay in sterling — this is known as dynamic currency conversion. It can be tempting as it means you’ll be able see straight away how much the transaction will cost you in pounds and pence. But the conversion rates used by foreign firms almost always work out as more expensive than if you had paid in the local currency and left it to your own bank or credit card provider to convert the cost.UK banks typically use the exchange rate offered by Visa or Mastercard, which is as near to a perfect rate as you can get.In this experiment, Alice and Heidi, who live in South East London, carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds. Even in the best cases, the extra cost of paying in pounds was still 3.1 per cent of the total bill.The worst offender was a cash machine at Berlin airport, where both twins withdrew €200. Heidi chose to be charged in euros, which worked out as £177.44 at the Mastercard exchange rate.          Starling Bank’s research also showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a typical 2.99 per cent fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currencyAlice, on the other hand, accepted the offer to convert the €200 to pounds there and then using the foreign bank’s rate. This ended up costing her £195.18 — an extra £17.74 or 10 per cent.When the sisters later split a €43.86 bill for cocktails at their hotel, the difference was far smaller. Heidi paid her €21.93 bill in euros, which worked out at £19.45. Alice paid in pounds, costing her £20.06 — an extra 61p or 3.1 per cent.The next day, the twins went shopping and each bought a scarf, a pair of trainers and a top from three different stores. Heidi paid in euros, spending €7.95, €69.10 and €9.99 — which worked out at £7.05, £61.30 and £8.86 respectively.Alice again converted her bills to pounds and ended up paying £7.28, £63.31 and £9.15. So altogether she paid an extra £2.53.After lunch — where, unusually, they weren’t offered the option of paying in pounds — they visited the Museum of Berlin, which had a €12 entry fee. Accepting the on-the-spot conversion cost Alice £11.05, while Heidi paid only £10.64.Finally, at the airport the following morning, the twins bought some €12.50 chocolates from a duty-free shop. Heidi, as usual, paid in euros, which later worked out at £11.09. After agreeing to pay in pounds, the chocolates cost Alice £11.70 — an extra 61p or 5.5 per cent.In many of these examples the difference between paying in pounds and euros is just a few pence. But over the course of a holiday this can add up. In fact, the rip-off is estimated to cost British tourists around £500million every year, according to travel money firm FairFX.At the end of the Berlin trip, Alice had spent a total of £317.73 — an extra £21.90 compared to Heidi.While this isn’t an enormous sum, it is an easy saving to make — all it requires is that you push a different button on the card machine. Experts say that some businesses are failing to give tourists a choice and automatically convert the bill into pounds.A spokesman for Starling Bank says: ‘This isn’t always intentional as sometimes shop assistants or waiting staff don’t understand and presume they are doing their customers a favour by selecting to pay in pounds for them. But in line with the law, cardholders should be given a choice before they pay.’Starling Bank’s research also showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a typical 2.99 per cent fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currency. FairFX is offering This is Money readers a free prepaid Mastercard currency exchange card.

Some home insurance policies are as long as 41,097 words, according to insurance ratings agency Fairer Finance. Car insurance policies can be as long as 38,336 words, and travel insurance up to 39,550In one instance, a woman had failed to declare a trip to the GP about pins and needles 14 years before she was being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.When she made a claim on her critical illness policy, her insurer, Prudential, turned it down on the grounds of ‘non-disclosure’, as pins and needles can be an early symptom of the condition.But the insurer was later ordered by the Ombudsman to pay out.Prudential says it is ‘extremely rare’ for it not to pay a critical illness claim and adds that it is sorry for the distress caused.James Daley, founder of Fairer Finance, says: ‘It seems that, as the pressure to set fairer prices increases, insurers are trying to reduce costs by wriggling out of as many claims as possible. Examples such as these, where insurers reject claims on a technicality, are toxic.‘Firms should be forced to flag major exclusions in big red letters before customers sign up.’A spokesman for industry trade body the Association of British Insurers says: ‘Insurers want to pay all claims and continually strive to make all customer communications as clear and simple as possible.‘Insurance is ultra-competitive and, when shopping around, it is vital that people assess their needs and check the cover to ensure that it best meets their requirements.’ £43 for 18 monthsOne year fixed rate£20 in M\u0026S points after first purchaseDouble points for a year£150 to switch, £50 to stay"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/22/4CBCE1D900000578-5784335-image-a-37_1527627607984.jpg","title":"New York Times writer trolls Prescot Journalists article labels town casualty austerity","story":"    Prescot\u0027s new fire and police station.

There was also once a sail-cloth factory, and coal mines – which have all long closed.In 1840, the district was noted for its ‘superior construction of watch tools’, while clay in the area was used for coarse earthenware.Currently, Prescot is building a replica Elizabethan theatre, with 350 seats, as part of an array of projects in the town, which the local council will provide visitors with a ‘thriving attractive destination.

Now, however, she has ‘locked-in’ syndrome. Her alert and able brain is marooned in an immobile body her mouth cannot articulate her thoughts.I imagined her condition would also have deprived her of humour and (as she cannot speak) the capacity to express it outwardly. Surely to be rendered mute and motionless must be the worst kind of imprisonment?But by some quirk of nature, and against all logic and reason, Shirley can still physically laugh. And she does so often and infectiously, bringing joy to all those around her.‘Shirley is definitely the happiest person I know,’ says one of her round-the-clock carers, Valerie Griffiths. ‘There are lots of lively and hilarious episodes with her. We laugh all the time. This isn’t a sombre job. Actually, it’s uplifting.’          Shirley, pictured with her father Henry Dennis on her wedding day aged 20 in 1980More than that, Shirley, 57, tells me — writing slowly on a computer operated by a sensor she works with her right cheek — that she is happy in some ways actually happier than she was in her former, able-bodied life.It is a startling admission and I ask her to explain. The answer takes shape slowly as she types.‘My former life was busy, noisy, pressurised and stressful, and now it’s quiet, peaceful and calm, with more time to fully appreciate life,’ she writes. ‘I’ve never really considered it before but I probably do feel liberated from the trappings of a normal working life.‘I certainly appreciate other people more and have time to fully enjoy the important things like being with friends and family. I think I feel a different kind of happiness now, born out of contentment.’It is an extraordinary response. Few of us who have the liberty to move and talk can think about being deprived of these faculties without utter horror. But Shirley has astounded, delighted and humbled me in the few weeks I have known her. She is, quite frankly, an extraordinary inidual.We spent several weeks swapping emails — she returning eloquent, thoughtful and often witty responses to my questions — before I visit her.I ask Shirley if she has ever, in her darkest days, succumbed to despair ever considered taking her own life.Her answer is emphatic. ‘Not even for a split second,’ she tells me. ‘My view is that a limited life is better than no life at all. However, I respect the views of those who differ. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.‘There were many dark moments during the first year,’ she concedes. ‘I cried a lot. But as my level of acceptance increased, so did my level of happiness.’She lives in a village on the edge of Dartmoor, Devon, in a specially-adapted bungalow next to a residential care home. Light streams through the French doors. There is a view of fields, and her cats, Smudge and Tigger, stretch languidly in the sun.  Shirley, pictured left on her wedding day in 1980 and right, aged 36, graduating from the University of the West of England in Bristol was not expected to survive her strokeShirley remains married to her husband, whom she won’t name (‘he’d kill me!’) but who lives nearby and visits often. He still runs the family farm on which she grew up.They didn’t have any children, which, she says, is not a regret because she did not want any in the first place.A good and loyal wife still, she respects his privacy. Questions as to how he copes with their situation, the nature of their relationship, whether he has found someone else, and whether she would be accepting if he did, are batted away with good humour but certitude. The no-nonsense, ruddy country girl has not gone away.‘I still love my husband,’ she says. ‘He makes me laugh. I miss him not being with me but I accept he couldn’t care for me. It would be a very demanding job. But it’s important that I’m still married.’ And that is the end of the conversation.Her constant companions are her carers. Valerie, 58 — cheerful and calm with a lilting Welsh accent — has been one of two regular carers for five-and-a-half years and works for two weeks, staying overnight in the bungalow’s bright spare bedroom, then has two weeks off when another carer comes.Extra carers from the adjacent home come in three times daily to help dress, wash and feed Shirley.She is still fiercely independent in many ways, however. She shops for clothes and groceries on the internet and manages her own care.          Shirley, aged 13 in school‘She types notes to us each day about food portions, heating, what she’d like to wear the positioning of the bed — things like that,’ explains Valerie.‘Are you allowed to say if you don’t like a carer?’ I ask Shirley. She laughs. ‘I’ve done so loads of times,’ she says. ‘I’ve sent carers away! I look for humour, patience no fuss.’It is a measure of her tenacity and determination that since she became locked in she has taken two Open University degrees — a Bachelor’s and a Master’s in social sciences with politics.The graduation certificates are framed and proudly displayed on the wall.For four hours a day, Shirley studied with the help of computer software that read books aloud to her. Exams were a test of endurance: Shirley was permitted four hours for every one hour of a usual exam.This meant standard three-hour exams — completed at her home in the presence of an invigilator — took 12 hours and were spaced over three days.I ask if the feeling of triumph when she graduated was magnified because of the effort involved. ‘Definitely!’ She smiles.She is an only child and her mum, who died three years ago, never properly recovered from the shock of seeing her daughter so severely disabled. ‘It was very hard for her,’ says Shirley, with understatement.Her dad Henry, who turned 90 in April, visits twice weekly and takes her on outings, usually to a park in Okehampton, and sometimes out to lunch. She enjoys the occasional vodka and orange. Eating and tasting food — which she is fed in pureed form — is also a positive pleasure that might have been denied to her had she not been so determined to learn to swallow.‘After my stroke I was fed through a peg-tube direct into my stomach,’ she remembers.‘I wasn’t even able to swallow saliva and I was told that I’d never be able to swallow. But with practice, initially through illicit consumption of chocolate buttons at the rehab centre where I went after hospital, I reached my goal of being able to eat.’Who fed you the forbidden chocolate buttons? I ask, amused. ‘My husband!’ she says. ‘I suppose you could have choked?’ I remark.She raises her eyes upwards, her signal for yes, and types: ‘But he didn’t dare say no!’          Despite her condition, she has successfully completed two Open University degrees - a Bachelor\u0027s and a Master\u0027s in social sciences with politics Grit and tenacity have always been strong components of Shirley’s personality — she would joke that she is actually ‘stubborn and awkward’ — and neither of these qualities has diminished since her stroke.She says she often thinks about her old life — not with wistful regret, but with pleasure that she has good memories to draw upon — and about the job she loved, her marriage and the farm.Her leisure time used to be full of activity. She loved aerobics, socialising with friends and, having grown up on her parents’ farm, the countryside and walking were in her blood.History remains a passion. Holidays in her old life were spent travelling to places ‘that had a bit of history about them’. Today, she admits the logistics are tricky — every outing assumes the complexity of a military manoeuvre — so she doesn’t venture far from home for more than a few days.In her old life she qualified as a solicitor through sheer hard graft. Having joined a law firm in Okehampton as an office junior straight from school at 17, she became a secretary, then, after a few years, studied to become a legal executive by correspondence course, while doing her day job.Finally she qualified in law in 1997 — her area of expertise was residential conveyancing — studying at weekends and passing her exams while still running a busy legal practice.          Shirley learned how to swallow again after being smuggled chocolate buttons by her husband while in a rehab centreEverything came to an abrupt halt one awful Sunday morning in December 2002. Shirley recalls: ‘I woke up with a splitting headache and, when I tried to get out of bed, I found that I had severe vertigo so went back to bed and stayed there much of the day.‘I felt a bit better late afternoon, and as I thought that some fresh air would do me good, I got up and went down to the farm for a walk.‘While I was there, I thought I would make myself useful and feed a few of the animals. But, while I was doing it, I felt a bit dizzy so sat down on a pile of hay.‘It was obviously then that I had my stroke, because the next thing I knew I was coming around in intensive care a couple of weeks later.’Much of what happened during her four weeks in hospital is obliterated from her memory. However, during the ensuing 16 months in a neurological rehab centre, the implications of the stroke hit her. ‘I didn’t handle it well. I cried a lot,’ she says of those early days.I wonder if the terror of being unable to communicate was her worst fear, but she explains that even in the early weeks she learned to raise her eyes to signal ‘yes’ and look down to indicate ‘no’.Communication with Shirley is necessarily a laborious process. If she is not at her computer, she spells out words with the help of an alphabet board, building them up painstakingly by blinking when her listener indicates the correct letter on the board.Inside, of course, her active brain is buzzing her sentences ready-formed into eloquent expressions of thought.I cannot imagine, I say, how frustrating it must be when strangers assume she does not understand them, because of her disability, and talk to her carer instead.‘At first it annoyed me,’ she admits. ‘But I’ve come to accept it as inevitable. Most people have never even heard of locked-in syndrome, let alone know what it is, so don’t know what to expect and can only go on appearance.‘I occasionally get frustrated when people don’t understand what I’m trying to say, but generally I’ve accepted my condition. It happened, I can’t turn the clock back, so I’ve just got to make the best of it.’Acceptance. It seems to be the key to Shirley’s happiness. That, and her obdurate refusal to ever capitulate.When she came out of rehab, it was obvious she would need professional care. Medics favoured a nursing home, but Shirley, then just 42, did not agree. ‘I’m not at all suited to institutional living,’ she says. ‘I’m far too independent. So they had to think again.’Their solution was judicious and creative. Her little bungalow, in a small assisted living complex next to the care home, gives her both a degree of autonomy and the comfort of knowing that, aside from her regular carer, there is constant support at hand. ‘Thankfully,’ she adds, ‘apart from the occasional bit of cramp or backache that everyone gets, I’m not in pain.’Because Shirley has such a rare capacity for joy, a visit to her home leaves you filled with an unexpected optimism that even the bleakest of personal tragedies can be turned into triumph.          Shirley said her life changed in December 2002 when she had a splitting headache and was unable to get out of bed because of vertigo‘I find joy in almost anything, no matter how small,’ she says. ‘And recently I’ve experienced the joy of watching my beloved Manchester City, who I’ve supported for 50 years, have such a record-breaking season.‘I’m very much a lady of leisure these days and, unless I’m going out, I spend much of the daytime at the computer, keeping in touch with friends and family by email or via Facebook, surfing the internet or watching TV.‘I like watching most sports, as well as historical documentaries and comedy. I laugh at just about anything and I generally laugh loudly. In fact, I only have to think of something funny and I start giggling.‘I’ve come to the conclusion,’ she adds, ‘that my brain’s default setting is happiness’ — and as I wave goodbye to her and turn to walk down the drive, once again I hear the glorious ripple of her laughter. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/00/4CBD476A00000578-0-image-a-50_1527637243397.jpg","title":"Father three finds hes not eligible 65K insurance payout","story":"    Vicky and Steven Huddleston took out critical illness insurance to cover their mortgage in the event that one of them became ill and ran into troubleVicky and Steven Huddleston took out critical illness insurance to cover their mortgage in the event that one of them became ill.The couple have three children, Amelia, 15, Jude, 12, and Lena, ten, and wanted to be sure they would be able to pay their bills should either of them suddenly be unable to work.So, when Steven, 40, nearly died in January after his heart stopped for 20 minutes, they were grateful they’d had the foresight to prepare themselves. Yet, despite paying £22 a month for 16 years - around £4,000 - Aviva refused to pay their claim. Britain’s biggest insurer says that because Steven suffered a cardiac arrest, not a heart attack, he is not covered and ineligible for the £66,500 payout.The insurer’s decision left the couple from Lancaster struggling financially. Steven, a self-employed floor layer, has been unable to work since he collapsed. Vicky, a midwife, has been forced to cut back on her shifts in order to care for him. So her income has been reduced, too.Vicky, 41, had woken up at 4am after hearing Steven gasping for breath. He collapsed in front of her and, as a trained medical professional, she fortunately knew to start CPR immediately.The children had to watch as she worked to keep their father alive until paramedics arrived. Without this quick thinking, Steven would almost certainly have died.It took four defibrillator shocks to get his heart beating. Steven was taken to hospital, where he had a permanent defibrillator fitted around his heart.DAN HYDE: Insurers stack the odds as they find sneaky ways...From locks picked by burglars to cars stolen by potential...Thousands of Currys shoppers are hit with £22 stealth fees...Why you should ALWAYS pay in local currency on holiday:...Share this articleVicky says: ‘I thought everything would be OK because the critical illness policy would pay out to cover the mortgage. But, 12 weeks after sending off the claim, I was told that Steven’s episode did not meet its criteria.’According to Aviva’s terms and conditions, a heart attack is ‘the death of a portion of the heart muscle as a result of inadequate blood supply, as evidenced by an episode of typical chest pain, new electrocardiograph changes and the elevation of cardiac enzymes’.Aviva says Steven’s records show that he suffered a disruption to the electrical system of his heart, causing it to stop beating.

This is not the first time that an insurer has rejected a claim on this basis.In 2015, Money Mail reported how HSBC refused to pay a father-of-two £40,000 after he suffered a cardiac arrest, citing small print in the policy. It was only after we stepped in that the bank agreed to pay the claim.After Money Mail contacted Aviva, the insurer agreed to cover six months of Steven’s salary and pay for private rehabilitation.The insurer said it could not pay out the full claim because Steven’s doctor had said he would make a full recovery. But Steven has been referred to a cardiologist for further tests and Aviva is understood to be reviewing the case again.A spokesman says: ‘We understand that this is a difficult time for Mr Huddleston and his family and we are currently supporting him in his recovery.‘Although his critical illness policy does not cover cardiac arrest, which is different to a heart attack, we have provided financial support that covers loss of earnings for Mr Huddleston since his illness and clinical support while he continues to recover.‘This support is separate to his critical illness claim, which we are unable to pay out based on the medical information to date.‘We understand Mr Huddleston is under cardiology review and we will continue to monitor any changes to his diagnosis to see whether we are able to meet the claim.’From locks picked by burglars to cars stolen by potential buyers: The loopholes insurance firms are increasingly using to reject claims Obscure loopholes are being used by insurers in the small print of their policies to avoid paying car, home, travel and health claims, a Money Mail investigation has found.In the worst cases, customers face thousands of pounds of costs to replace stolen cars or belongings taken when their home was ransacked by burglars.Others are facing huge medical bills abroad because insurers are relying on little-known policy catches to refuse claims.          Obscure loopholes are being used by insurers in the small print of their policies to avoid paying car, home, travel and health claims, a Money Mail investigation has foundMoney Mail’s investigation has found:Some insurers won’t pay out if burglars break in by picking the lock instead of smashing a window.Drivers are being turned down for payouts by motor insurers if their car is stolen by someone posing as a potential buyer.Holidaymakers who’ve been told by a doctor that they need urgent knee or foot surgery while overseas are having claims rejected because travel insurers consider the treatment ‘non-essential’.Travel insurers are digging through customers’ medical records from years ago and using visits to the GP about vague symptoms such as pins and needles to reject claims for serious illnesses such as multiple sclerosis.Life insurers are refusing critical illness claims after customers have nearly died because they suffered a cardiac arrest and not a heart attack.Travellers who have a glass of wine on holiday and later injure themselves in an unrelated incident are being refused cover for medical expenses.DAN HYDE: Insurers stack the odds as they find sneaky ways...From locks picked by burglars to cars stolen by potential...Thousands of Currys shoppers are hit with £22 stealth fees...Why you should ALWAYS pay in local currency on holiday:...Share this articleIt comes after the Mail reported on the case of 50-year-old Juliet Thomas, who was left with a £30,000 medical bill when her insurer voided her travel policy because she had failed to declare that she was taking sleeping tablets.Experts say it is unreasonable for customers to be aware of these types of exclusion when the average home insurance policy length is 20,799 words — roughly the same number as in Lewis Carroll’s classic book Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland.Some home insurance policies are as long as 41,097 words, according to insurance ratings agency Fairer Finance. Car insurance policies can be as long as 38,336 words, and travel insurance up to 39,550.Martyn James, a consumer expert who has worked for the Financial Ombudsman Service, says: ‘Insurance exists to cover you for the unexpected events that can occur in life.‘But Money Mail’s investigation has clearly shown that there are countless occasions when unclear or unfair contract terms are used to avoid paying out a claim — this practice undermines the whole industry.’An analysis of cases that went before the independent dispute service for insurance claims, the Financial Ombudsman, found that some insurers refuse to pay out when a burglar has not used ‘force and violence’ to gain entry to the customer’s property.          Some home insurance policies are as long as 41,097 words, according to insurance ratings agency Fairer Finance. Car insurance policies can be as long as 38,336 words, and travel insurance up to 39,550It means that unless thieves break a window or kick down the door, insurers will reject claims — even if the customer had locked the doors and windows and the burglar picked the lock.In one case last year, Royal \u0026amp Sun Alliance (RSA) declined a couple’s home insurance claim after police said it was likely the burglars had used a skeleton key to get into the property, leaving no evidence of forced entry.A spokesman for RSA says: ‘In this instance, there was no settlement as the cover terms within the customer’s policy were not met by the claim.’Meanwhile, some insurers refuse claims if customers have the wrong type of locks on windows and doors. In February, for example, one man was refused a payout following a break-in because thieves entered a ground-floor window that was on a latch.His insurer, LV, claimed he had not complied with the security conditions of his policy, which stated that all his windows must have key-operated locks. A spokesman for LV says the requirement had been explained verbally and in the customer’s policy documents.Money Mail’s investigation also found that some motor insurers refuse to pay out if a customer’s car is stolen by a thief posing as a potential buyer, or if the spare key is kept in the car — even if it is locked out of sight.In a case referred to the Ombudsman, the thief posing as a buyer had asked the owner of the car if he could take it for a test drive. The owner refused and offered to drive himself.He later agreed to switch places with the ‘buyer’ but, as soon as he opened the door to get out, the thief made off with the car.When the owner reported the incident to his insurer, Advantage, his claim was rejected. The firm says that the policy excluded cover for ‘loss or damage to your car where possession of it is gained by deception of someone who claims to be a buyer or agent’.Travel insurers, meanwhile, may turn down claims for medical expenses incurred overseas if they don’t think that the treatment was ‘essential’. In one case, a man was told by a doctor that he needed surgery after snapping a tendon in his heel while on holiday.However, his insurer, Aviva, said that it didn’t think it was ‘medically necessary’ to have the surgery abroad and wanted to repatriate him back to the UK for treatment. When he went ahead with the operation regardless, Aviva refused to cover the cost.Aviva says that its travel insurance policies only cover treatment overseas if it cannot wait until the customer returns to the UK and that this is detailed in the policy terms and conditions.It adds that it had paid to get the customer home after the surgery. Consumer expert Martyn James says: ‘It isn’t right that customers are expected to challenge a medical professional when they are distressed and in a foreign country where they don’t speak the language.’Travel and health insurers may also refuse claims if they discover customers have not declared GP visits and physio appointments — even if they occurred years ago and the customer was never diagnosed with a condition. In one case seen by the Ombudsman, a man was refused cover after he was admitted to hospital with severe back pain caused by an extruded disc hernia. Axa discovered that he had been to his GP with back and leg pain two months prior to travelling.          Travel insurers may turn down claims for medical expenses incurred overseas if they don’t think that the treatment was ‘essential’Yet, despite the fact that he was only told to take over-the-counter medication and to self-refer for physiotherapy, Axa said he was not covered for claims arising from any medical condition for which he’d been prescribed medication or received treatment within six months of booking the trip.However, the Ombudsman said that it was not reasonable for Axa to expect the customer to notify his insurer of the GP visit when he had not experienced a significant change in health. Axa says it accepted the ruling and has paid the claim.  Some travel insurers also try to reject claims where the customer has had alcohol, even though the incident was unrelated. And others will use completely unrelated health issues or injuries to avoid paying out.In one instance, a woman had failed to declare a trip to the GP about pins and needles 14 years before she was being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.When she made a claim on her critical illness policy, her insurer, Prudential, turned it down on the grounds of ‘non-disclosure’, as pins and needles can be an early symptom of the condition. But the insurer was later ordered by the Ombudsman to pay out. Prudential says it is ‘extremely rare’ for it not to pay a critical illness claim and adds that it is sorry for the distress caused. James Daley, founder of Fairer Finance, says: ‘It seems that, as the pressure to set fairer prices increases, insurers are trying to reduce costs by wriggling out of as many claims as possible. Examples such as these, where insurers reject claims on a technicality, are toxic.‘Firms should be forced to flag major exclusions in big red letters before customers sign up.’A spokesman for industry trade body the Association of British Insurers says: ‘Insurers want to pay all claims and continually strive to make all customer communications as clear and simple as possible.‘Insurance is ultra-competitive and, when shopping around, it is vital that people assess their needs and check the cover to ensure that it best meets their requirements.’ £43 for 18 monthsOne year fixed rate£20 in M\u0026S points after first purchaseDouble points for a year£150 to switch, £50 to stay"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/16/4CBACB1200000578-0-image-m-23_1527607021781.jpg","title":"Most Britons agree immigration harmed communities","story":"    Based on a British poll, as well as on views taken from focus groups across Britain, Germany and France, the report said nearly two-thirds of people in the UK believe life was better when they were growing up. But it added: \u0027Despite the widespread critiques of contemporary British society, and anxieties about the future, many citizens remain both resilient and begrudgingly optimistic – a point that sets them apart from participants in our French and German focus groups.\u0027Afghan Co-op worker\u0027s wife and son win reprieve to stay in...Ruth Davidson backs Jeremy Hunt\u0027s call for substantial extra...Share this articleThe report also said that alongside the concern that the country is in a \u0027state of decline\u0027, British people are united by the belief that immigration has had a negative impact and that \u0027the nation\u0027s cultures and traditions are not being sufficiently defended and promoted\u0027. Large numbers of people, it said, are \u0027particularly incensed by cultural pluralism, seen to be favoured over British values and traditions, and political correctness, regarded as taxing and repressive\u0027.The findings from Demos, a think-tank once regarded as close to Tony Blair, and which is now led by an ex-senior aide to former Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg, come at a time of persistent attacks from left-wing activists on figures widely seen as central to British values.           Theresa May\u0027s portrait was removed from the geography school at Oxford University after complaints that Mrs May\u0027s policies on Brexit and the Windrush scandal were offensiveThese range from a tweet by Historic England, the quango charged with celebrating national monuments, on the idea that Nelson\u0027s Column should be demolished, to the removal of Theresa May\u0027s portrait from the geography school at Oxford University.The picture was removed after complaints that Mrs May\u0027s policies on Brexit and the Windrush scandal were offensive.The Demos poll, which saw more than 1,000 Sky TV subscribers questioned, found that while 43 per cent thought immigration into Britain had been positive, 44 per cent thought it had had a negative impact instead.Nearly 71 per cent thought immigration had ided communities where migrants have settled.

Terrified shoppers flee as...Share this article‘But, from the first day he joined the school, it became evident that he had a talent for football that was way beyond his years.’Thirteen years and 37 England caps later, Raheem Shaquille Sterling’s success on the football pitch continues to be as stratospheric as his all-too-regular failures off it.          Sterling, pictured here with his girlfriend Paige Lee Hansel, is part of Gareth Southgate\u0027s squad to travel to Russia next month for the World CupOn one hand, the rise of the 23-year-old star represents an old-fashioned sporting fairy tale: a working-class boy who came to the UK as an infant and, through talent and hard graft, has achieved fame and fortune beyond the wildest dreams of his immigrant single mother.A key figure in Manchester City’s title-winning season, scoring 18 goals in the process, the £200,000-a-week forward will be cheered by a nation when he takes the field at the coming World Cup.Yet, on the other hand, this supposed role model has for far too long allowed himself to be defined by acute lapses in judgment that — in the eyes of many critics, at least — have turned him into a symbol of the amorality that is today at the heart of the so-called Beautiful Game.Recent years have seen court appearances, at least one reported tryst with a prostitute and secret dates with a Playboy model who was most certainly not Paige Lee Hansel, the long-suffering fiancee and mother of his youngest child Thiago.  Sterling has been photographed taking \u0027Hippy Crack\u0027, left, and with a shisha pipe, rightOn social media, where he shares images and videos of his gaudy mansion in Cheshire, purchased for £3.1 million in 2016, high-end cars (he’s said to own seven — one for each day of the week) and collection of bling wristwatches, he’s also been filmed smoking and inhaling a mind-altering intoxicant known as ‘hippy crack.’In this ignoble tradition came yesterday’s somewhat bizarre controversy over Sterling’s decision to get a large new tattoo — of an M16 assault rifle.He showed off the design, running down the lower half of his right leg, in a photo shared with his 3.6 million followers on Instagram on Monday.It was taken at England’s training ground in Staffordshire as players assembled to start preparations for the World Cup, which begins in just over a fortnight.Critics promptly condemned it as provocative and irresponsible, pointing out that more than 60 people have been killed by gun and knife violence in London this year alone and that similar weapons have been used in countless recent mass shootings in the U.S.Branding it ‘sickening’, ‘disgusting’ and ‘totally unacceptable’, the lobby group Mothers Against Guns called for him to be dropped from the England side.Lucy Cope, whose son was shot dead outside a London club, said: ‘He’s supposed to be a role model, but chooses to glamorise guns.’Last night, her words were echoed by the father of Damilola Taylor, who was stabbed to death in a street attack aged ten.Richard Taylor told The Sun: ‘Young people look up to footballers. Sterling hasn’t displayed the discipline we expect. He should be reprimanded and made to apologise to victims’ families.’Iffat Rizvi, who runs the Starr anti-guns campaign, said: ‘This is disrespectful to young people who lost their lives.’      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/03/4CBDC3D300000578-0-image-m-9_1527646585226.jpg","title":"John Goodman Sara Gilbert spotted Roseanne canceled","story":"    Roseanne Barr returned to Twitter on Tuesday night to apologize and blame her racist Twitter rant on sleeping pills          Actor John Goodman, 65, stepped out to walk his dog in New Orleans on Tuesday soon after news broke that his show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 had been canceled because of his castmate Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets          Sara Gilbert, 43, was also spotted looking annoyed as she left a Los Angeles restaurant through the back door after finishing lunchSoon after the news broke, Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the TV show, was spotted looking very glum as he walked his dog in New Orleans. Goodman, 65, is yet to offer any comment on Barr\u0027s tweets or their show being axed. His costar Sara Gilbert was also spotted looking annoyed as she left a Los Angeles restaurant through the back door after finishing lunch. Gilbert, who played Darlene Conner on the series, had earlier slammed Barr\u0027s tweets as \u0027abhorrent\u0027. The 43-year-old actress, who was also an executive producer of the Roseanne revival, tweeted: \u0027Roseanne\u0027s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show.

Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign.     The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.     Comedian Wanda Sykes had earlier revealed she would not return to the show following the comedian\u0027s racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett (Pictured L-R: Sykes, Russell Peters, Barr, JB Smoove, Keenen Ivory Wayans in 2014)          Sykes, a consulting producer for Barr\u0027s eponymous show on ABC, revealed the news on Twitter          Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled           Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the showEmma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power. Bullies will NEVER win.\u0027Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the show.   \u0027Ton of respect for Bob Iger.

I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their home,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter.           Sara Gilbert, an executive producer of the Roseanne revival who has played Darlene Conner for the entirety of the series, called Barr\u0027s tweets \u0027abhorrent\u0027          Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027Fishman said he condemned Roseanne\u0027s statement \u0027vehemently\u0027, saying they were \u0027reprehensible and intolerable\u0027 and \u0027truly offensive\u0027.  \u0027My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.          Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski          When one user called Barr\u0027s tweet racist, she proclaimed that \u0027Muslims r NOT a race\u0027           Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend her controversial joke, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027          She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027      A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne. I told you. So,\u0027 author Roxane Gay added, to which Julianne Moore replied: \u0027Yes you did. #FireRoseanne.\u0027 Reverend Al Sharpton also criticized the comedian and called on ABC to \u0027take action now\u0027. \u0027The comparison by Rosanne Barr on ABC of Former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable,\u0027 he tweeted. Tomi Lahren was a rare prominent conservative voice to hit out at Roseanne. \u0027What Roseanne said was wrong,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she knows that. She made a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why fellow conservatives are playing mental gymnastics trying to justify it. Come on. Wrong is wrong.\u0027 Only Rosie O\u0027Donnell appeared to lend some support to Roseanne, writing that she loved her \u0027quite a bit\u0027. \u0027The comment Roseanne tweeted was racist and childish and beneath her best self,\u0027 O\u0027Donnell wrote. \u0027She has apologized. Twitter is a dangerous place.\u0027     Many Twitter users called out Barr and asked ABC how they could continue to order episodes of her eponymous show (pictured)          Barr came under fire on the very night the revival of Roseanne premiered in April when she accused Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg of giving a \u0027Nazi Salute\u0027.Barr swiftly took the tweet down and claimed that she had seen a \u0027doctored\u0027 image of Hogg. But internet sleuths found a grab of Barr\u0027s original tweet, which revealed she was commenting on picture of Hogg raising his fist at the March For Our Lives rally. That same week, Barr also made headlines when she tweeted about a bizarre right-wing conspiracy theory claiming Trump broke up a pedophile ring created by Democratic politicians.  Barr claimed that it was Trump who had freed \u0027so many children held in bondage to pimps all over this world\u0027.           In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope UC Davis gets nuked\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel\u0027He has broken up trafficking rings in high places everywhere. notice that. I disagree on some things, but give him benefit of doubt-4 now,\u0027 she added. The tweet was similar to when, in 2015, Barr revealed that she believed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex-ring in a pizza shop. \u0027Americans! The reason #DEMOCRATS aren\u0027t approving #Sessions is bc he will prosecure #HRC – and make arrests over PedoGate RT THIS!! WAKE UP!!\u0027Barr was slammed and derided for the tweets. She later apologized for mentioning child trafficking and said Twitter was \u0027not the place for it\u0027. In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope all the jews leave UC Davis and then it gets nuked!\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel           In 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rightsIn 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rights. \u0027Women do not want your penises forced in their faces or in private bathrooms. Respect that,\u0027 she wrote.  After the comedian\u0027s most recent Twitter controversies came to light, Walt Disney President Ben Sherwood responded that \u0027you can\u0027t control Roseanne Barr\u0027.\u0027Many who have tried have failed. She\u0027s the one and only,\u0027 he added. But as Tuesday\u0027s news has proved, you can still cancel here.                         \u0027You\u0027re a racist pig \u0026amp ABC should be ashamed that they give you a platform,\u0027 another added. Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend herself, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027. \u0027Islam includes EVERY RACE of people,\u0027 she added, still without acknowledging the fact that there is no evidence Jarrett has ties to the Islamic faith. She also retweeted an article whose headline read: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027 About an hour later, Roseanne apologized and said she was leaving Twitter.     \u0027I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans,\u0027 she wrote in a separate tweet. \u0027I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.\u0027             Jarrett\u0027s faith wasn\u0027t the only conspiracy theory Barr tried to push on Tuesday. She also claimed that Chelsea Clinton was married to the nephew of George Soros. Clinton is married to Mark Mevisnky (pictured)           Chelsea Clinton herself was quick to shoot down the rumor, which was first propagated by actor and Trump supporter Scott Baio in 2016Jarrett\u0027s faith wasn\u0027t the only conspiracy theory Barr tried to push on Tuesday.The comedian also claimed that Chelsea Clinton was married to the nephew of George Soros, a rumor that was propagated by actor Scott Baio in 2016. \u0027Chelsea Soros Clinton,\u0027 Barr tweeted.The theory was quickly and swiftly dismantled. Clinton is married to Marc Mezvinsky. Meanwhile, George Soros has two sons named Peter and Jeffrey Soros.But Chelsea Clinton herself was quick to respond to Barr, writing: \u0027Good morning Roseanne - my given middle name is Victoria. I imagine George Soros\u0027s nephews are lovely people. I\u0027m just not married to one.\u0027Barr first apologized to Clinton directly, tweeting: \u0027Sorry to have tweeted incorrect info about you! Please forgive me!\u0027 \u0027By the way, George Soros is a nazi who turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps \u0026amp stole their wealth-were you aware of that?\u0027  In a separate tweet, Barr wrote: \u0027I\u0027m sorry-Chelsea Clinton IS NOT married to a nephew of George Soros-i apologize for the mistake!\u0027 A spokesman for Soros has since vehemently denied Barr\u0027s claims, calling the comments \u0027insulting\u0027 and an \u0027affront to his family\u0027.           Much like its revival, Roseanne was an almost instant success when it premiered in 1988 and quickly became the umber one show on television It also turned Barr, who previously performed stand-up comedy on Johnny Carson\u0027s Tonight Show, into a household name. The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties.   The show  tackled episodes that focused on taboo topics for the times like homophobia, abortion, teen pregnancy, masturbation, and domestic abuse.Barr, who has a lesbian sister and a gay brother, also made sure to feature a number of LGBT characters on the show. One episode of the show even featured Roseanne contemplating whether or not she should have an abortion, while others discussed previously taboo topics like masturbation.           The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties - such as issues paying bills and homophobia The show won both Barr and Laurie Metcalf, who played her sister, respective Emmy Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. It also won the prestigious Peabody Award in 1992. ABC announced in May 2017 that it planned to do a revival of the beloved series, which aired in March of the following year. The news garnered controversy from the beginning when it was revealed Roseanne would return as a pro-Trump grandmother. It also featured episodes that include her husband Dan, played by John Goodman, losing his job to an illegal immigrant and Roseanne\u0027s fears after finding out her new next-door neighbors are Muslim.

The Ayn Foundation – which currently boasts Andy Warhol’s The Last Supper – opened in Marfa in 1993, and art galleries like IndeJacobs and Rule Gallery, as well as design boutique Wrong Marfa, are all set up in Marfa. So is a landmark fake Prada boutique on the roadside, which is an artwork by Elmgreen \u0026amp Dragset from 2005.Just last year saw the small town of 2,000 people host Solange Knowles at a concert for Judd’s Chianti Foundation.Next up, Marfa will see a new solar powered Stonehenge project by British artist Haroon Mirza. The piece, entitled Stone Circle, is a set of black marble-like rocks in the Texas desert until 2023 (but potentially indefinitely). Every full moon, there will be a musical concert and light show in what Mirza calls “solar symphonies”, with the first one held on 28 June.“On full moons, the stones will start to play composed electrical signals, which will be quite musical,” said Mirza over the phone from his London studio. “You will hear the electricity as sound.”The stone pieces stand in a circle, like the ancient Stonehenge or the famed Nine Ladies site in Derbyshire. Set in the high desert, eight chunks of marble will sit in a circle with the ninth as the “mother stone”, charging the circle through a bank of batteries underground. “You see the electrical current as light and you hear it as sound,” said Mirza.The stones are made of marble shipped from Mexico, which light up at night. “During the day, they look like quartz crystals, but at night they glow with electricity,” he said.Mirza, who is the winner of the Silver Lion for Most Promising artist at the 54th Venice Biennale in 2011, has made solar-powered artworks in the past, like wall-works which generate sound from electricity, including Duet for a Duo (Solar Symphony 7) from 2015. He recalls his first mystified experience with the Stonehenge as he drove past it decades ago. “I remember thinking it was an alien thing, like a UFO landing,” he said. “It has an incredible aura to it, from a distance and up close.” It wasn’t about replicating the Stonehenge, but presenting a new experience. “The feeling of being at the Stone Circle is a sense of commune with nature,” said Mirza. This artwork is more than just a journey out into the desert, as it also promotes solar power in the south. Freedom Solar, the Austin-based solar panel company, donated half of the solar panels for the project. They’re also offering a rebate for new solar customers referred through the gallery which is presenting this project, Ballroom Marfa. (Freedom Solar also offers local workshops for west Texans wanting to switch to solar power at home and at work.) Surprisingly, it’s working. “When I first visited Marfa, I didn’t see one solar panel anywhere, which I thought was surprising because there is a lot of sun,” said Mirza. “There is controversy around it, but there is potential for solar energy in that part of Texas and people have started installing solar panels, which is a positive move.”“It’s a no brainer, actually,” he adds. “If you live in a climate like that, it makes a massive difference.” The project was no easy feat, as Stone Circle took five years to materialize, and it didn’t help that the marble was stuck at the Mexican border for nine months. “I thought it was going to be easy, but it was complicated and expensive,” said Mirza. “Sometimes it’s better to be naive and have ambition and think big.” For the first full moon gathering, the marble ‘stones’ will light up and play sounds that call to mind electronic music. “I’ve composed the electrical signals,” said Mirza. “It depends what you regard as music.” Even though the Stonehenge was used as a site for worship, there will be no sacrificial lambs. “People are perceiving and preaching it as a spiritual gathering, but I don’t have an intention of it being a spiritual thing,” said Mirza."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31efb6b8926d9e0735f7622f3027c14439935987/0_0_5488_3293/master/5488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df8cc596d1a1ab152e065930e7fc1a12","title":"westminster abbey weston tower ptolemy dean gallery","story":"The Weston Tower, a sci-fi-style wonder by Ptolemy Dean, opens up a hidden gallery above the nave where William and Kate’s wedding certificate is likely to draw crowdsNestled into an armpit of Westminster Abbey, hidden behind a flying buttress that leaps up to the chapterhouse, stands what appears to be a gothic space rocket. Sinuous bronze tracery loops its way up the faceted shaft, framing crystalline windows between bands of lead arrowheads, like go-faster stripes shooting towards the heavens.“We’ve had enormous fun doing this,” says architect Ptolemy Dean, surveyor to the fabric of the abbey since 2012. “It’s not every day you get to add a new tower to Westminster Abbey.”Dean’s curious Weston Tower is the most significant addition to the building since Nicholas Hawksmoor’s west towers were completed in 1745. It has been deftly inserted in a south-eastern corner, between the 13th-century chapter house and the 16th-century Lady Chapel, to provide the public with access to the triforium for the first time, a hidden timber deck that snakes its way around the rafters, seven storeys above the nave. After five years and a combined project expenditure of £22.9m (privately fundraised), this atmospheric attic has been reborn as the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Galleries, stuffed with regal and religious treasures dating from across the abbey’s thousand-year history.Dean, whose first project at the abbey was wittily disguising a waste compactor in the form of a green timber taxi drivers’ shelter, has clearly had a great time developing his tower design. He has raided the back-catalogues of architectural history with promiscuous relish, sampling from the abbey’s many different layers to concoct a ripe confection of his own.An intersecting rotated square motif, found in the Henry VII Chapel, provides the basis for the star-shaped plan of the tower, which has been glazed with leaded windows, based on Christopher Wren’s late 17th-century additions to the abbey. The arrow detail of the leading and the elaborate crown rooftop are both inspired by Ely cathedral, while the looping bronze tracery over the windows is a nod to Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s trainshed at Paddington Station.The result is less pastiche than an energetic collage of bits and bobs. It could have been a gaudy eyeful, but the resulting sci-fi gothic lantern is somehow in keeping with the general riot of competing ornamentation with which the abbey is encrusted. Endlessly extended and remodelled over the centuries, the complex is not the result of a single hand: it is a patchwork of accretions in various versions of gothic. Dean’s Weston stair tower is simply the latest intriguing layer.The history lesson continues inside, where a stepped corner of the abbey’s ancient raft foundation has been revealed, built from 11th-century blocks of stone from Caen in France. The discovery was the architect’s cue to take visitors on a geological journey: he has wrapped his new lift shaft with 16 different kinds of stone sampled from the abbey’s history, laid in alternating bands. There’s pinkish Purbeck marble seething with fossils white Portland stone left with tooling marks as Hawksmoor used it hard grey Kentish ragstone Yorkshire magnesian limestone and even Reigate stone, of the kind used in the original west front from 1243. “No one has used Reigate in London for hundreds of years,” Dean claims. “We had to reopen a quarry in a corner of the M25.” He sadly refrained from adding a final layer of concrete breeze blocks at the top, in reference to the 1950s lavatory block that used to occupy the site of the tower.Visitors will spiral around this great mineral totem pole as they climb the new oak stairs, catching views across to the stained glass windows and carved stone details of the abbey, never before seen up close. Once at the top, the triforium galleries themselves open out as an enticing world of ancient oak beams crisscrossing their way around the attic, where exhibits have been beautifully spotlit in mercifully minimalist vitrines by museum design experts Muma (McInnes Usher McKnight Architects), the firm responsible for the V\u0026ampA’s medieval and Renaissance galleries and Manchester’s Whitworth Art Gallery revamp.Dean’s whimsy is all very well for the Weston Tower, but in the galleries, the cool, restrained hand of Muma allows the 300 precious artefacts to sing. Simple plinths of Purbeck stone appear to hover slightly off the floor, while seamless glass cases rise flush from the bases, containing everything from Wren’s 2.4-metre high model of his (unrealised) tower design, to the eerie funeral effigies of English kings and queens that were once paraded through the streets to the abbey. One jaw-dropping highlight is the elaborate concertina paper model of the interior of the abbey, made for the coronation of Queen Victoria in the 1830s, a kind of “peep show” designed to allow a wider audience to appreciate the spectacle of the ceremony. From the sublime to the prosaic, the artefact likely to draw the biggest crowds is apparently the wedding certificate of William and Kate.The designers’ greatest triumph is allowing natural light to flood in without the possibility of damaging any of the priceless pieces on show. They carefully modelled all the sunbeam paths so that no sensitive objects would ever be touched by direct light, ensuring that none of the elaborately carved windows that ring the edge of the triforium would have to be blocked up. It would have been so easy just to make it a black box, but the presence of shafts of sunlight streaming in through the tracery is what makes this such an atmospheric place. It gives you the feeling of exploring a secret realm, formerly only inhabited by gargoyles, pigeons and the ghosts of dead royals – who now feel more present than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f623ca269ef176dfaa8c30cff1cf576b36673a4/0_0_3579_2147/master/3579.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f722602bfff05ec9a0e7d210cdb343","title":"frank horvat in pictures","story":"Italian-born photographer Frank Horvat, a contemporary of Henri Cartier-Bresson, revolutionised fashion shoots with his black-and-white realism and eye for a killer pose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aba4002d116a71a235031d4badf1ef4c63c3e77e/0_221_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd3a7937d738ea551c0c6257517daf7e","title":"george soros drastic action needed for eurozone to survive","story":"Billionaire says holding fresh referendum soon could save UK from ‘immense damage’A campaign to secure a second Brexit referendum within a year and save the UK from “immense damage” is to be launched in days, the philanthropist and financier George Soros has announced.The billionaire founder of the Open Society Foundation said the prospect of the UK’s prolonged orce from Brussels could help persuade the British public by a “convincing margin” that EU membership was in their interests.In a speech on Tuesday ahead of the launch of the Best for Britain campaign – said to have already attracted millions of pounds in donations – Soros suggested to an audience in Paris that changing the minds of Britons would be in keeping with “revolutionary times”.Best for Britain had already helped to convince parliamentarians to extract from Theresa May a meaningful vote on the final withdrawal deal, he said, and it was time to engage with voters, and Brussels, to pave the way for the UK to stay in the bloc. It is expected to publish its campaign manifesto on 8 June.Soros, 87, said: “Brexit is an immensely damaging process, harmful to both sides ... Divorce will be a long process, probably taking more than five years. Five years is an eternity in politics, especially in revolutionary times like the present.“Ultimately, it’s up to the British people to decide what they want to do. It would be better however if they came to a decision sooner rather than later. That’s the goal of an initiative called the Best for Britain, which I support.“Best for Britain fought for, and helped to win, a meaningful parliamentary vote which includes the option of not leaving at all. This would be good for Britain but would also render Europe a great service by rescinding Brexit and not creating a hard-to-fill hole in the European budget.“But the British public must express its support by a convincing margin in order to be taken seriously by Europe. That’s what Best for Britain is aiming for by engaging the electorate. It will publish its manifesto in the next few days.”Soros said he feared the EU could be heading towards another major financial crisis triggered by austerity and populist political parties intent on blowing the bloc apart.Sounding the alarm as financial markets fell into turmoil on Tuesday amid a deepening political crisis in Italy, Soros said the EU had lost its way since the 2008 banking crash and required radical transformation in order to survive.“The EU is in an existential crisis. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong,” he said.However, Soros said he was convinced it was the ideal time for the EU to reform itself and prepare the ground for the UK staying inside the bloc.“The economic case for remaining a member of the EU is strong, but it will take time for it to sink in,” Soros said. “During that time the EU needs to transform itself into an association that countries like Britain would want to join, in order to strengthen the political case.“Such a Europe would differ from the current arrangements in two key respects. First, it would clearly distinguish between the European Union and the eurozone. Second, it would recognise that the euro has many unresolved problems and they must not be allowed to destroy the European Union.”Italian bonds dropped sharply on Tuesday, pushing the country’s borrowing costs to the highest levels in more than four years as concerns grew that the EU’s third-largest economy could exit the single currency. Sergio Mattarella, the country’s president, vetoed the appointment of a Eurosceptic as finance minister over the weekend, laying the ground for fresh elections later this year.Hungarian-born Soros said an “addiction to austerity” at the heart of Europe was harming economic development, which had in turn been exploited by populist politicians to stoke anti-EU support.The UK could sign up to all the EU’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.Soros said there were still steps that could be taken to make the EU more appealing to ordinary voters who had been let down by Brussels since 2008. Calling for an EU-funded Marshall-style plan for Africa worth about €30bn (£26bn) a year, he said migratory pressures across Europe could be relieved by helping developing nations. He called for the EU to abandon rules requiring member states to join the euro, lest they eventually combine with other EU rules to “destroy” the project altogether.Echoing a call made by David Cameron before the Brexit vote, he argued for the EU to allow member states to pursue “multi-track” relations with the bloc, rather than “ever closer union”. “Europe needs to do something drastic in order to survive its existential crisis. Simply put, the EU needs to reinvent itself,” he said.This year, Soros moved to defy his critics over his £400,000 donation to Best for Britain by pledging an additional £100,000 to support efforts to fight Brexit. OSF’s total funding for pro-Europe campaigns and organisations is now at more than £800,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/959ef516252d3bf579901524e2ea934d6f1b1673/0_259_5059_3035/master/5059.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f077dbc12580edacbc6cb568897bbeb3","title":"european markets set to open lower on italian political turmoil business live","story":"Wall Street and Asia fall sharply as investors fear new elections could bring further uncertainty to ItalyItaly is issuing new bonds this morning, which will give another indication as to how investors feel about the current situation.

The question is legitimate, not only because historians have long established how, in his rise to power, Hitler took Mussolini as a model. And not only because Donald Trump was preceded on to the world stage by Silvio Berlusconi – another unscrupulous tycoon devoid of political experience, unfit for government, and with whom Trump shares more than a few personal traits. Above all the question is legitimate because, in Italy, not one but two populisms have won. Together they command more than half the votes in parliament and were until a few days ago on the verge of forming a government.That talks have now collapsed hardly dissipates the danger. On the contrary, the very fact that these populisms have struck hard at the constitutional powers of the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, shows how determined they are to upend the country’s institutional setup. With new elections, probably in the autumn, the populists are likely to emerge even stronger. But for now Italy is set to be led by a transition government – with no majority.Both populisms raked up support with Europhobic slogans and concepts of a revolt of “the people” against the “elites” – all in the name of an imaginary “direct democracy”. One is the Five Star movement, founded by the comedian Beppe Grillo alongside a prophet of web-based democracy, Roberto Casaleggio. The other is Matteo Salvini’s League – no longer a secessionist party of the north but a far-right party that expresses sympathy for the regimes in Russia and North Korea.They predict an apocalyptic future for a public already frightened of globalisation and impoverished by European austerity policies. These are powerful, aggressive forces that have appeared throughout Europe – but are now, for the first time, ready to call the shots in a country that was a founding member of the European Union and has always been firmly anchored in multilateral and transatlantic alliances.This Italian “double populism” will not renounce its programme, which aims to control the government through a sort of politburo known as the “conciliation committee”, placed wholly under the control of Five Star and the League. It aims to neutralise parliament by making it impossible for lawmakers to switch parties – whereas the freedom of MPs to do so is written into the constitution. Unpopular laws would be submitted to a sort of screening by referendum the same would apply to international treaties, and therefore to all the steps that Italy has taken to be part of the EU and the eurozone\u0026nbsp– even though backtracking on treaties is forbidden by article 75 of the constitution.It all brings to mind what the author Robert Musil called (in his 1943 book, Man Without Qualities) “parallel action”: a world where pseudo reality prevails and governance is useless. But what the populist platform contains is not just reform – it carries, ominously, elements of regime change. The already uncertain liberal profile of Italy’s democracy is set to be disfigured. We will move from a society that is traditionally open and welcoming, with a certain propensity for the good life, to the closed horizons of a country that resembles a corporate, statist and repressive autarchy.The coalition “contract” that these populists want to implement includes not only massive public spending, which would break the budget and push Italy out of EU rules, but also the creation of specific crimes for immigrants and forced mass repatriations, as well as the closure of asylum centres and all Roma camps. The limits of legitimate self-defence are to be extended to include confronting burglars with weapons in hand.This dark shadow stretching over Italy has been given substance because of the collapse of traditional parties in the March general election. The centre-left Democratic party – for long the pivot of the political system – lost half its electoral base, about 5m votes, a million\u0026nbspand a half of which shifted to Five Star. Immediately after that defeat the Democratic party leader, former prime minister Matteo Renzi, announced that it should go straight into opposition, even though it had come second in the election (behind Five Star and ahead of the League).On the other side of the political fence, Berlusconi is trying to get back on track as a statesman with European credentials, strutting around meetings of the mainstream right European People’s party. Yet he’s the one who gave his on-off ally Salvini the go-ahead to enter a coalition with the Five Star movement.The contortions of both parties paved the way for populism. The Democratic party proved unable to move on from Renzi’s leadership, despite a long series of defeats – not least a crushing one in the 2016 referendum on wide-ranging constitutional reform. Forza Italia and the moderate centre-right are tied to the ailing but still hegemonic figure of Berlusconi. On top of that, both mainstream parties did nothing during the campaign but imitate the themes, proposals and styles of the populists, instead of pushing back against them.The crisis threatens Italy with international isolation, and will almost certainly prevent it being part of the lead group in a future two-speed Europe. But the EU will find itself with fewer friends in confronting the selfishness and closed horizons of other xenophobic nationalisms, from central Europe to Austria.The darkness that is falling on Rome will be a test of real democracy. Just as with the obscurantism and fortress mentality of Trump’s America, it will be up to civil society and citizens to oppose the vision and policies of populists and nationalists. And to do so with the ambition of sending a warning – rather than an example – to the rest of the west.• Antonella Rampino is a journalist and political commentator based in Rome• This article was translated from Italian by Anna Kraczyna"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd26689cb7616dc5620dedb710f39cf11ac10cc1/214_77_2489_1494/master/2489.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10a1d19a5af63504465a1946258ae679","title":"roseanne barr tweet valerie jarrett ape","story":"Network pulls Barr’s revived show and condemns racist tweets towards ex-Obama adviser Valerie JarrettRoseanne Barr’s revived sitcom has been cancelled after she posted a racist and Islamophobic tweet that attacked former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett.The sitcom star falsely alleged that Jarrett, who was born in Iran to American parents, has connections to the Muslim Brotherhood, and compared her to an ape.

She also deleted the tweet.Barr was replying to a post from a user that accused Jarrett, a long-serving adviser to the president, of covering up the Obama administration’s alleged “misdeeds”.When a Twitter user told Barr that her tweet was offensive and racist – Jarrett is African American – Barr responded by writing: “Muslims r NOT a race.” Shortly after, Barr reiterated her stance in another post: “ISLAM is not a RACE, lefties. Islam includes EVERY RACE of people.”Barr later apologized. She wrote: “I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me – my joke was in bad taste.”In a second statement she said: “Today my words caused hundreds of hardworking people to lose their jobs. I sincerely apologise to the audience that has embraced my work for decades.”Barr tweeted throughout the night, at one point asking her followers not to defend her actions.MSNBC reported that Jarrett received a call from Iger before news broke of the cancellation. “This should be a teaching moment,” she said. Jarrett responded later on Tuesday during a town hall on race hosted by the cable news channel, saying she believed ABC made the right decision in canceling Barr’s television show.“I’m fine,” she said at the event titled Everyday Racism in America. “I’m worried about all the people out there who don’t have a circle of friends and followers coming to their defense,” she said. “The person who’s walking down the street minding their own business and they see somebody cling to their purse or walk across the street. Or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation, ‘the talk’ as we call it.” “Those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day,” Jarrett said. The White House declined to offer a reaction from the president, who earlier this year personally called Barr to congratulate her on the show’s ratings.Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One there were “a lot bigger things going on in the country right now”, while adding that Trump was focused on negotiations with North Korea.Barr’s tweets sparked condemnation from many prominent figures, including one of the sitcom’s consulting producers, Wanda Sykes, who announced that she would not be returning for the proposed second season.Barr’s co-star Sara Gilbert, who plays Darlene, condemned the tweets as “abhorrent”. Gilbert wrote: “Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least.”The 65-year-old Barr has been in the public eye recently after her eponymous sitcom returned after a two-decade hiatus. The now-cancelled show was ABC’s most-watched “new” series, averaging almost 18 million viewers per episode. In the show, Roseanne Conner plays a working-class Trump supporter, but Barr herself has not been shy about her allegiance to the president, frequently engaging with his critics online and peddling conspiracy theories shared by Trump’s base, such as “Pizzagate”, “Pedogate” and theories about the murder of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich.Barr also retweeted a post comparing Clinton to Donkey from Shrek.After Clinton replied with a tweet of her own, Barr apologized in sarcastic fashion. “Sorry to have tweeted incorrect info about you!,” she wrote, again invoking Soros, a frequent target of Trump and the right. “I Please forgive me! By the way, George Soros is a nazi who turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps \u0026amp stole their wealth-were you aware of that? But, we all make mistakes, right Chelsea?”A spokesperson for Soros called the tweet “an affront”.After her tweets and the outrage that followed, Barr announced she was quitting the site. “I apologize,” she wrote. “I am now leaving Twitter.”News of Roseanne’s cancellation was met with cautious positivity in Hollywood. Actor and comedian Kumail Nanjiani tweeted: “I’m glad Roseanne is canceled. The backlash to its cancellation is going to be a deafening nightmare. Nothing good has come of this entire thing.”Bruce Helford, the Roseanne show’s executive producer and showrunner, said he was “horrified” by the comments. Barr has also been dropped by her agency ICM Partners, which stated that her tweet was “antithetical to our core values”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e2bcd34c43a65a0a65e755e63360df57796f020/1_0_2775_1665/master/2775.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=65ecdb6637cf369ccec6a9ac4bb25356","title":"revealed industrial scale beef farming comes to the uk","story":"Investigation uncovers about a dozen intensive beef units, despite assurances that US-style practices would not happen hereThousands of British cattle reared for supermarket beef are being fattened in industrial-scale units where livestock have little or no access to pasture.Research by the  and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has established that the UK is now home to a number of industrial-scale fattening units with herds of up to 3,000 cattle at a time being held in grassless pens for extended periods rather than being grazed or barn-reared.Intensive beef farms, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) are commonplace in the US. But the practice of intensive beef farming in the UK has not previously been widely acknowledged – and the findings have sparked the latest clash over the future of British farming. The beef industry says that the scale of operations involved enables farmers to rear cattle efficiently and profitably, and ensure high welfare standards. But critics say there are welfare and environmental concerns around this style of farming, and believe that the farms are evidence of a wider intensification of the UK’s livestock sector which is not being sufficiently debated, and which may have an impact on small farmers. In contrast to large intensive pig and poultry farms, industrial beef units do not require a government permit, and there are no official records held by DEFRA on how many intensive beef units are in operation.But the  and the Bureau has identified nearly a dozen operating across England, including at sites in Kent, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The largest farms fatten up to 6,000 cattle a year.Drone footage and satellite images reveal how thousands of cattle are being kept at some sites in outdoor pens, known as corrals, sometimes surrounded by walls, fences or straw bales. Although the cattle will have spent time grazing in fields prior to fattening, some will be confined in pens for around a quarter of their lives, until they are slaughtered. Supermarket demand is believed to be, at least in part, driving the trend. In addition, some smaller and medium-scale beef producers have struggled to farm profitably in recent years, with sometimes tight margins and fluctuating costs. Most of the units identified are believed to have grown incrementally, rather than setting up from scratch.A number of retailers, including the Co-op, Lidl and Waitrose, are among those found to be sourcing beef from UK intensive industrial scale farms, most of which are privately owned but sell to beef processing companies, which in turn supply retailers.Chris Mallon, director of the National Beef Association (NBA), the industry trade body, said the reason the largest units have come about was purely down to “efficiency”.“What we’re talking about here is commercial production, for feeding people. It’s not niche market. A lot of this will be on supermarket shelves – that’s where it’s coming into its own. In the catering side as well, they’ll be doing it,” he said.“One of the things we’ve seen over the years is supermarket domination of the beef trade. What they want is specification, size of cuts, size to fit certain packaging, size of roasts – this has all become incredibly important.”“The difference is we’re getting some larger units now and that will be because of economies of scale … if you can give the people you’re supplying a constant supply of cattle that are in the right specification, that makes you more valuable. And that’s one of the reasons we’ve seen a move towards it.”Dr Jude Capper, a livestock expert who has studied intensive beef units in the US and elsewhere said that due to economies of scale “it’s almost inevitable that a larger farm can produce a greater quantity of a more affordable product – we see this in almost all agricultural sectors globally, just as we do in other industries”. and Bureau last year revealed that 800 poultry and pig “mega farms” or CAFOs have appeared in the British countryside in recent years, some housing more than a million chickens or about 20,000 pigs.Following the revelations, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, pledged that Brexit would not be allowed to result in the spread of US-style agribusiness: “I do not want to see, and we will not have, US-style farming in this country,” he said in a parliamentary statement.Although the number of beef units is tiny in comparison with intensive poultry or pig farms, the latest findings have further fuelled fears that the UK could be embracing industrial-scale practices.Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavillion, said the farms were “gravely concerning” and that “with Britain hurtling towards Brexit, and with our animal and environmental protections facing an uncertain future, I’m worried that we could end up adopting more of this US-style agricultural practice”.Richard Young, Policy Director at the Sustainable Food Trust, said: “Keeping large number of cattle together in intensive conditions removes all justification for rearing them and for consumers to eat red meat... More than two-thirds of UK farmland is under grass for sound environmental reasons and the major justifications for keeping cattle and eating red meat are that they produce high quality protein and healthy fats from land that is not suitable for growing crops.”Young added that that smaller scale beef farmers might feel the impact, as larger farms were likely to be “more efficient in purely economic terms”, allowing the supermarkets “to drive down the retail price of beef below the price at which more traditional farmers can produce it. As a result they go out of business.”Beef production in the UK typically involves three distinct stages - calf rearing, growing and fattening - with many farms specialising in one part of the rearing process. Cattle may move between a number of different farms during their lifecycle. (A smaller number of farms rear cattle from birth and keep them on the same farm until being sent to the abattoir.)After spending time on pasture many cattle are moved to dedicated “finishing units” and are typically housed in barns or grazed whilst being fattened ahead of slaughter, often for around 6 months. Many are fed specialist diets designed to encourage weight gain.But in the US, much beef fattening takes place in “feedlots” with cattle held in vast outdoor pens where the largest facilities confine up to 85,000 livestock. Such “feedlots” have proved controversial in the past, both because of their size and because many cattle were given hormones and antibiotics, sometimes to encourage rapid growth. (Such practices are not permitted in the UK).Despite acknowledging the arrival of intensive beef farming in the UK, experts reject the notion that the British beef sector will see a wholesale shift towards farming on a US-scale.Caroline Lucas called for the system of permits to be tightened up, and said “the Government should be officially recording the number of feedlots rather than letting reporting slip through a loophole … we need a proper debate in this country over what kind of agriculture we want in the future.”A spokesperson for DEFRA said that “beef farms are regulated in exactly the same way as any other farms”. But it later acknowledged that “Defra does not have a database of feedlot style units...The Cattle Tracing System can provide figures on the number of holdings split by premised type e.g. Agricultural Holding, Slaughterhouse, Market etc. and the number of animals registered to each. However, it does not hold any data in respect of the feeding practices on the holdings.”Waitrose said of its own supplier: “Animal welfare is of the highest importance to us and a large farm does not equal poor animal welfare standards. The farm is run under a bespoke environmental management plan in conjunction with Natural England. All the cattle graze the marshes during the summer season then during the winter months, when the grass is dormant the cattle are bought back to the yard when the finishingfattening cattle are housed in covered sheds. For clarification the length of grazing season is weather dependent, once the grass stops growing the cattle need to be yarded and fed a forage based ration in accordance with animal welfare and best practice.”A spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium said: “Our members take their responsibilities to animal welfare very seriously and work closely with trusted suppliers so that high welfare standards are upheld. They have strict processes in place and will thoroughly investigate any evidence of non-conformity to ensure that any problems are immediately addressed.” approached several of the largest units but all declined to comment.Pressure group Compassion In World Farming (CIWF) have raised concerns that some cattle held at in “feedlots” are kept in “high stocking densities” with little or no shelter or shade and “no dry ground to rest on.” The group says it believes “cows belong on pasture”.Evidence compiled by the Bureau and  suggests that most intensive beef farms appear to operate to high welfare standards.

Others asked Glenn and the chairman, Greg Clarke, specific questions about the deal’s main essentials, including how far England and other prestige football matches will be guaranteed to take place in the stadium – the FA has said these and the stadium’s name will be protected until 2057 – how the money would be spent and whether £600m is enough money.The FA is relying on the City bank Rothschild for advice that the price represents good value Clarke stressed to council members last week that £600m was not the first offer from Khan, who wants Wembley as a London base for his NFL franchise.Glenn explained that reaching the £1bn figure relies on the FA securing further “match” funding for facilities improvements locally, which will be difficult given severe government cuts to local authorities.From next year investment in community facilities by the FA, Premier League and government via the Football Foundation will be £70m annually.Glenn projected that only £150m of the £600m proceeds of the Wembley sale would be spent initially, with the other £450m invested, to generate £30m annual interest.Of the £150m, Glenn said £50m a year would boost annual investment from the current £70m to £120m every year for three years. With “match funding”, he forecast this £360m would increase to around £500m “accelerated investment”. In succeeding years, the £30m interest would be added to the £70m regular capital investment fund, with a further £30m expected from match funding, Glenn said.“By 2030, just over 10 years from the completion of a potential sale, we could have invested over £1bn on community football facilities – and still have a £450m capital fund untouched,” he told the council.A major focus of investment is more 3G all-weather pitches. Glenn told the council the proposed investment would produce a doubling of 3G pitches, a “hub facility” for every County Football Association, “major investment” into grass pitches and other improvements.He also addressed the demand made by the EFL, which has insisted that under the FA’s financial arrangements half the proceeds should go to professional clubs for community‑focused investment. FA executives believe that can form part of the deal, Glenn referring to professional game “community trusts and foundations” having improved facilities for football projects.“Receiving an offer to sell Wembley Stadium is not a betrayal,” he said. “It is not selling the soul of the game. What we have in front of us is simply an opportunity.”The FA will continue to consult its council and board members, who include Premier League and EFL representatives, before a decision is reached."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dfd4887a8cf3b566dd1bbd2b8886fe44f1f8943/24_17_1112_667/master/1112.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f9fab1911ce1e4a1a69afacb565f447","title":"jose mourinho porto full back diogo dalot manchester united","story":"José Mourinho is hopeful of making Porto’s Diogo Dalot his first signing of the summer.

With the support of his family he has recovered to conquer Italy and grab the attention of Óscar Tabárez.It had been a long and difficult journey, from the trips from his childhood home in San Jacinto to train with his first club, Central Español, 50km away in Montevideo, to his debut in their senior side, his transfer to Nacional, and eventually to Italy and international recognition. Along the way he has been inspired by memories of his father, whose signature is tattooed on his right hand. On 1 August 2017 he opened a new chapter of a remarkable story by moving to one of Europe’s great clubs. On the day he was introduced as Internazionale’s latest signing he turned to his mother and asked: “What would Dad say if he saw me here?”Mario Vecino was also a footballer, whose career peaked with a spell in the Uruguayan top flight with Liverpool. When he died, killed in a car crash on his way to work, Vida Nueva, the local club in San Jacinto, renamed their ground the Estadio Municipal Mario Vecino in his honour. “That night I gathered the family around the table and told them what had happened,” says his mother, Dolly. “But we all got on with our lives, because the family was strong and we did not just sit down to cry or look for pity.” At one point Dolly, an English teacher, was doing three jobs in an effort to support her family.Dolly still lives in San Jacinto with her younger son, Nicolas. Her daughter, two years older than Matías is a lawyer. “Nicolas was the one most affected by the death of his father,” she says. “For months he was looking for him. He thought it was his dad every time someone knocked on the door or the phone rang. He was two and a half years old.”Matías had taken his first steps into the world of football as a four-year-old, when he joined his local kids’ team, with his father as coach. “Mario spent hours teaching him,” says Dolly. “He didn’t want Matías to win, he wanted his kid to learn.”He was taken on by Central Español and travelled every day to train in Montevideo. When he returned home he would give his grandmother Esther his white football boots and she would clean them for the next day. “They were the only boots he had and they are something that reminds him of how far he has travelled to get where he is today,” his mother says.“There were days when I would see him heading out with his little backpack on, walking in heavy rain, and I’d ask him: ‘Are you sure training’s going to be on?’” his uncle Raul Falero remembers. “And he’d say to me: ‘We’ll find a way.’”Daniel Sánchez was the manager at Central Español when Vecino made his debut in 2010. “When I first joined the club to work with the under-15s, he was already there,” he says. “Then I was head of youth and finally first-team coach. When Matías was in the under-20s his coach told me he was the best player he had.”Eventually he was promoted alongside Diego Riolfo, the other star of the club’s youth system, a striker who plays in the Argentinian top flight for Godoy Cruz. It was a difficult time for the Palermitanos, who were fighting relegation. On 6 March 2010 Vecino made his debut, playing the final half-hour of a 4-1 win over Tacuarembó.“In his first few games we played him in a more attacking role, to free him of responsibilities,” Sánchez says. “But game by game he was becoming more integral to our tactics, and he kept his place in the team.”He was called up to represent his country at junior level, and played in the 2011 South American under-20 championship in Peru, where he scored the goal that earned his country a place at the 2012 Olympics. “He told me that he didn’t want to be remembered for that goal,” his mother says. “He wanted to continue writing his story.”His performances in Peru earned him a move to Nacional, and after 18 months there he was bought by Fiorentina. In Italy he had loan spells at Cagliari and Empoli and it was at Empoli, under the guidance of Maurizio Sarri, that he flourished, playing as one of two defensive midfielders. His performances were so impressive that Antonio Conte, then the manager of Italy, tried to convince him to take citizenship of his adoptive country. “He told me that it didn’t feel right, and he wanted to wait for the chance to play for Uruguay,” says his mother.In March 2016 that opportunity arrived. He was in the starting lineup as Uruguay went 2-0 down to Brazil in Recife before fighting back to draw 2-2. “I couldn’t have been more nervous,” says his mother. “There’s no way I would have missed it. I’ve seen every one of his debuts.” Unless injured or suspended, he has played for his country in every game since.His final appearance of the season for Inter came at Lazio on the last day, a match in effect a winner-takes-all Champions League qualifier. The Nerazzurri twice came from behind, and in the 81st minute Vecino headed the winner to take his club into Europe’s premier club competition for the first time since 2012. “I haven’t scored that many goals,” he said, “but this is the most important of my career.”His story, however, has a few chapters still to be written.Pablo Benítez writes for El Observador.

Here are the 13 rules of survivalFortnite is a “battle royale” game in which 100 players land on an island, run around collecting weapons, resources and items from abandoned houses, build forts for protection, and then attempt to blast each other right back into the starting menu. The last player standing wins.When you first start out, it can be a little bewildering – but not nearly as bewildering as not playing and then trying to understand what your daughter means when she tells you she just took out two John Wicks with nothing but an uncommon silenced pistol.If you’re thinking of dipping your toe in, here are 13 tips to get you started.1. Stay on the battle bus until the endIf you want to live long enough to collect a couple of guns and some resources, stay on the bus until the last few seconds and then land somewhere near the coast. Very few players will be around, because most of them eject immediately over Tilted Towers. This way, you at least get to arm yourself and have a little look around before being pulverised by a stranger dressed like Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad.2. Land on a roof when you eject from the battle busYou’ll want to land near a house, where you’re most likely to find weapons and chests. But it’s even better to land on the roof. This gives you a height advantage on anyone else nearby, and also means you can quickly chop your way through each floor, grabbing all the goodies from the top of the house to the bottom.3. Prioritise weapons over resources in the opening secondsAs soon as you’ve landed, you need to find something useful to fight with just in case someone else has dropped nearby – you don’t want to be running at them with your pickaxe. At this stage anything will do, though a tactical shotgun or submachine gun will be best because it’s likely to be a close encounter. Don’t engage anyone unless you really have to. You’re not Rambo.4. Learn about weapon gradingThere are five grades of weapon in Fortnite: gray (common), green (uncommon), blue (rare), purple (epic) and orange (legendary). With each grade, the weapon’s damage capabilities improve, so always prioritise rarer weapons.5. Learn to make a basic fortAs quickly as possible while you’re exploring the world, start smashing stuff up to get you the three basic resources: wood, bricks and metal. Wood is the weakest but also the quickest to build with, so, if someone is firing at you, this is what to go for first. The basic defence is to surround yourself with four walls, then build a ramp in the middle and jump on to it as its forming. This gives you height and cover. Building other identical levels on top of this will accentuate your height advantage, but only building upwards makes you vulnerable to someone blowing up your lower levels with a rocket launcher, destroying your whole tower. If you can, it helps to build around a scenic structure like a house, as that gives you a head start on gaining height and a decent foundation. As you get nearer to the endgame, start making stronger buildings out of brick and metal, but always use ramps so that you have cover.6. An assault rifle and a shotgun are your must-have weaponsThese will see you through most encounters. Prioritise automatic assault rifles over burst fire models as the latter are trickier to use in a sudden firefight. There are scoped ARs, giving you the long-range aiming of a sniper rifle with the rapid fire of an AR (handy for when you’re exploring), and then there are special combat assault rifles, which do lots of damage and reload fast. They’re the motherlode of the assault rifle world.There are three types of shotgun. The pump model delivers more damage but takes longer to reload, while the tactical shotgun is quicker but weaker. The heavy shotgun – available in epic and legendary flavours – is powerful, quick to reload and has a longer effective range – it is very much the Incredible Hulk of short-range combat. Many players line up a pump next to a tactical in their armoury, getting away an opening shot with the former, before quickly switching to the latter. If you’re unsure, stick with any AR and a tactical shotgun.7. If you want to practise shooting, go to Tilted TowersIf you’re new to the game, it’s worth getting some practice in with combat, and that means dropping down in a city and becoming bullet fodder for all the young scamps who have been doing this for three hours a day since September. Just land, find a weapon and try to shoot it at someone. Fortnite has an authentic – if rather exaggerated – physics system, so the further away your target is, the more you need to lead your shot, firing just over their heads, and slightly in front if they’re running past.8. Pack your perfect inventoryEvery player has their own priorities when it comes to filling their backpack. Many go for three weapons (short, medium and long range), bandages or a health kit, and some sort of projectile, such as a grenade or clinger. If you’re new to the game, it’s probably not worth wasting an inventory slot on remote mines, impulse grenades or boogie bombs. If you pick up anything that boosts your shields, use it immediately – it’ll free up an inventory slot and there’s no benefit to saving them. If you’re not planning to get in many firefights, prioritise health kits and large shield potions over bandages and small bottles. As a newcomer, when you do get into a fight, it’s likely you’ll need massive medical intervention rather than a plaster and a kiss on your sore bit.9. Use sound to your advantageIf you can, wear decent headphones, preferably with 7.1 surround sound. This way you get excellent audio feedback on where another player is in relation to you. (Footsteps are really noisy in this game.) Also remember that everything you do, from changing weapons to slurping some shield potion, is audible to nearby players. Oh, and crouching makes your movement harder to detect. Start weighing up every action in terms of how it gives away your position - especially in cities.10. Stay away from open groundYou are basically cannon fodder when walking through open fields, so try to vary your movement, using jumping and weaving, rather than legging it in a straight line, which is basically the equivalent of shouting: “Shoot me now.” Use scenic elements such as hills, trees and walls as cover. Chopping down trees sends leaves flying into the air, alerting everyone within 500 metres to where you are. 11. Stay away from close encountersLet’s face it, the chances are, you’re going to lose in close, open combat. So be sneaky. If you spot another player, try to engage them from a distance using a scoped rifle – and wait until they’re standing still. Alternatively, watch them for a while, hold off until they’re engaged in exploring or building, then get into the crouch position and tiptoe up to them. Use a shotgun and aim for the head. It’s also a good idea to swoop in after you’ve observed two players fighting each other as they’ll both be low on health and shields. If all else fails, don’t feel bad about running away.12. Tweak the controlsSome people find the controls over-sensitive, which can make it tough to construct forts at speed. If that’s the case with you, go into the menu and change the settings. You can also tweak the button configurations depending on whether you want to prioritise combat or building. Once you’ve learned what your strengths and weaknesses are, there’s no shame in using the controller options to augment them.13. Watch the expertsIf you really want to immerse yourself in Fortnite’s surrounding culture (or properly get good at it), head to YouTube or Twitch and watch experienced players. The likes of Ninja, Myth and Dakotaz are considered the best in the world, but Britain’s Ali A is a really good starting point – he explains his strategies clearly and makes professional, watchable videos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89fabfbf2513818a016c6e825d56be45f09e2392/16_0_545_327/master/545.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=055317ec36b9ebec6103a0f45b514fb2","title":"pokemon lets go games announced for nintendo switch","story":"New games aim to mix mass appeal of Pokémon Go with nostalgia of classic titlesThe Pokémon company and Nintendo have announced new Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch, marking the debut of the franchise on the popular console. The announcements were headlined by two games that aim to mix the approachable nature of the hit mobile app Pokémon Go with the more in-depth appeal of the mainline role-playing game series, alongside a healthy hit of nostalgia.Based on a combination of the first-generation 1998 game Pokémon Yellow and Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let’s Go Pikachu and Pokémon: Let’s Go Eevee return players to Kanto, the setting of the original games, in an updated graphical style. Various familiar elements of the mainline series, such as battling, trading and exploration, are also shown.Catching Pokémon now involves players flicking the Switch’s Joy-Con controllers or a new gadget, the Poké Ball Plus, at the screen in a manner familiar to players of Pokémon Go. Other elements, such as cooperative play and the ability to transfer Pokémon captured in Go into the new games, point to an attempt to capitalise on the wildly successful worldwide phenomenon.“I wanted to bring the fun of this more intuitive, as well as widely accepted and popular, Pokémon-catching gameplay, right back to the Pokémon main series RPGs,” said director Junichi Masuda, one of the original developers, at the reveal event in Tokyo, Japan. “Not only have we managed to make these titles great entry games for those who are new to the Pokémon RPG series, but at the same time really provide a new and fresh experience that fans of the series will enjoy.”Nintendo and the Pokémon Company also said a “free-to-start”, simplified RPG titled Pokémon Quest would release on the Switch’s digital storefront on Wednesday, coming to mobile phones in June, and an “all-new core series” title was in development for the second half of 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fffd39c72a98203b8ee3940b74812d6792ea420/0_0_7405_4443/master/7405.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f90723b7f5e534d0d98279e9d9965a9","title":"one weekend bender can ruin your life pancreatitis","story":"Just one big night out drinking can lead to pancreatitis – a painful and potentially fatal illness. Young people describe how their lives changed dramatically overnightIn her bedroom in Clacton-on-Sea, on the Essex coast, 16-year-old Somer Lawrence perfects her Tim Burton-themed Halloween costume. By the time the night is done, Lawrence will have downed a 70cl bottle of vodka. The Corpse Bride is drunk.In the Cotswolds village of Wotton-under-Edge, 29-year-old Lee Peters manages to play the piano in his flat, despite having consumed an entire bottle of gin.In Malia, Crete, 18-year-old Stuart Marshall celebrates the end of his lads’ holiday by drinking five half-pints of spirits.Meanwhile, 23-year-old Rebecca Charles enjoys the sunshine with friends at the beach. They bring cider, beer and wine. By nightfall, she will have drunk 35 units of alcohol.What all these stories have in common is what happened next. Charles woke up at 5am and was sick straight away. Marshall’s friends found him curled up in a ball. Lawrence was rushed to hospital. Peters was carried out of his house on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance after a neighbour called 999.They had all developed pancreatitis, a disease brought on by excessive alcohol consumption that can turn one night in the pub, or a day at the beach, into a life-altering illness – it can often be fatal.“You can get pancreatitis after a single binge,” says Dr Sarah Jarvis of the campaign group Drinkaware, although she explains it’s more common to develop it after repeated binges.After the sudden death of the Swedish DJ Avicii, pancreatitis is becoming better known. He had been afflicted by the condition after abusing alcohol during exhausting world tours and, after his death, his family issued a statement saying “he could not go on any longer”. His death has forced us to pay attention to a condition we would perhaps rather ignore.In the UK in 2016, 7,327 people died of a range of conditions that could be directly attributed to alcohol abuse. While the number of direct alcohol-related deaths have been relatively constant since 2013, they are higher than they were in 2001, when 5,701 people died as a direct result of alcohol abuse. English alcohol-related hospital admissions are at a record high – up two-thirds from a decade ago – while spending on alcohol support services has been cut.Peters, Lawrence and Charles all now have chronic pancreatitis. “In the town I lived in, drinking was a massive part of the culture,” says Charles, who is now 31. “Everybody else was doing it. But I wasn’t getting up in the morning and drinking – the way people imagine alcoholics behave. I was just too much of a party girl.”“I was stupid and young,” says Lawrence, who is now 20. Although she went to hospital several times after the incident at her Halloween party, Lawrence continued drinking, and developed chronic pancreatitis at 17. She began drinking aged 14 because it eased her anxiety and depression. “I’d turn to alcohol as a coping mechanism,” she says. “I’d always be the one at the party who’d had the most to drink. It gave me liquid confidence.”She isn’t alone. “Wine had this lovely, numbing quality to it,” Peters says. Now aged 34, he began binge drinking after being violently assaulted at 16. “It was absolutely a response to trauma. It was the self-medication tool I used when things got stressful.”Alcohol abuse is often linked to mental ill health. “Drug and alcohol use can lead to mental health problems, and vice versa,” says Dr Cyrus Abbasian, a consultant psychiatrist at St George’s, University of London, who specialises in mental health and substance abuse. He explains that alcohol is an anxiolytic, meaning that it has a sedative effect. “You’re self-medicating your mental health condition,” he says. “Alcohol leads to short-term relief of anxiety, but it doesn’t treat the underlying problem.” Over time, a person may develop alcohol dependency, alongside their existing, untreated mental health issues.In a difficult relationship, and with postnatal depression after the birth of her daughter, Charles fell in with a party-loving crowd. “You think the alcohol is making things better,” she says. “But it’s actually making things worse.”Some argue that minimum-unit pricing, implemented in Scotland earlier this month, would tackle the problem of at-home drinkers who take advantage of cheap supermarket offers. “Minimum unit pricing is an excellent idea,” Abbasian says, “because it’s an evidence-based public health intervention. With any drug, you need to limit supply and increase price to reduce use. If something is cheaply and easily available, people tend to use it.” In some instances, supermarkets had been selling alcoholic drinks more cheaply than the same quantity of water.But would minimum-unit pricing have deterred Lawrence, who would drink a bottle of vodka because she was too young to get into bars? Possibly. “When you’re young, you can’t get into pubs, so you get a bottle of vodka for seven or eight pounds,” she says. “I don’t know why we thought it was necessary to be drinking spirits. Why were we drinking vodka at 15 or 16? It’s what everybody did, so it’s what I did.”We all have friends who push things too far. They’re the ones with cracked phone screens and jeroboam-sized hangovers on Sunday mornings. Their anecdotes of drunken misadventures make you laugh, but also make you queasy.Or maybe you’re that friend. “People drink so much because it’s our culture,” adds Lawrence. “The sun comes out and you go to a beer garden. It’s what we do. Everything is just an excuse to drink. Life is hard for everybody, so it’s nice to have an escape.”But Jarvis believes if people were aware of the health consequences of binge drinking, they would drink less. “Most people have no idea that you may be doing yourself damage now that can last a lifetime.”Here’s something to make binge-drinkers pause mid-sip: pancreatitis hurts. “It’s like the worst stomach ache you’ve ever had,” Marshall says.When your pancreas begins to fail, the pain never goes away. After her pancreatitis turned chronic, Charles’s pancreas stopped producing the enzymes she needed to digest food, causing her to become malnourished. Her weight dropped to 29kg (63lb). She can’t work full-time or look after her 10-year-old daughter. On good days, she showers and does laundry. The bad days are dark. “I think: ‘I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.’”Life becomes small. Drinking buddies melt away faster than ice in a spritzer on a warm summer day. “It’s lonely,” Charles says, “when you’re surrounded by people who party the whole time and you don’t want to be a part of that any more. It’s like they don’t want to know you.”Peters also lives alone. A kindly neighbour checks up on him. “She has dug me out of some dark places,” he says. When he goes out, his emaciated frame attracts pitying looks. “It’s difficult because I used to be a good-looking chap with a decent body that people would comment on.” But not being able to work takes the biggest toll. “I feel quite ashamed by it,” Peters, a former accountant, says. “Having to go from being fiercely independent to being dependent on the state doesn’t sit well with me.”After we talk on the phone, Peters emails me a list of the 14 medicines he takes daily, and the 25 symptoms he experiences. (“Constant, debilitating pain … regular sepsis.”) “I can sense the grim reaper approaching,” Peters writes, before signing off with a cheerful reminder not to work too hard.How does he bear it? Keeping his mind occupied helps. So do antidepressants. Knowing that he caused his disease, Peters says, “is difficult to cope with”. After his first bout of pancreatitis, Peters kept drinking. “It’s difficult to explain why,” he says, pointing to the trauma of his early attack as a partial explanation. He also felt that doctors were possibly exaggerating the severity of his condition, out of overcautiousness.“It’s hard to explain what makes people unable to stop drinking,” says Abbasian. “With some patients, I have a conversation with them, and they say: ‘Yes, doctor, if I drink, I’ll have pancreatitis and I’ll die.’ But they don’t find other things as pleasurable and, because of their underlying anxiety disorder, they continue to self-medicate.”Peters says: “I have tried very hard to come up with a rational reason as to why I was so neglectful and blase about my health, but there’s nothing I can come up with that will make sense to anybody. I’ve been very foolish. I made those decisions and I’m aware I made them. I thought: ‘Hell, sod it, I’ll think about it tomorrow.’ But tomorrow catches up with you. It caught up with me, big time.”Chronic pancreatitis has no cure. Many people with the condition go on to develop pancreatic cancer. Surgical procedures are sometimes necessary. Charles’s gallbladder has been removed and doctors have performed a coeliac plexus block on her – an injection made using local anaesthetic to treat severe abdominal pain. Peters has advanced-stage chronic pancreatitis and takes prescription painkillers, including morphine, as well as enzyme replacement drugs, anti-sickness medication, anti-seizure medications, proton-pump inhibitors to reduce the acid in his stomach, anti-constipation tablets and meal-replacement drinks.Despite all these interventions, about one in five people with pancreatitis will die within five years of their diagnosis. “I have a terminal prognosis,” Peters says quietly. “I have gone downhill quite rapidly in the last six months. Lots of treatments don’t work any more. I’m literally wasting away.” A few days after we speak, Peters experiences projectile vomiting, a fever and excruciating pain and is admitted to hospital with an acute flare-up of pancreatitis.It’s easy to be judgmental about Peters’ situation. You may think: why didn’t he just stop drinking when his doctors warned him? But trauma makes people behave irrationally. Rape survivors become promiscuous, intelligent people ignore medical advice, the children of alcoholics binge-drink.And even if you have never experienced trauma yourself, not drinking in our culture is hard. “My friends are drunk all the time and they’ll be in the club buying me drinks,” Lawrence says. “They don’t realise the severity of my illness because they don’t have to live with it.” Charles gets angry when she sees people being peer-pressured. “People will taunt someone who isn’t drinking,” she says. “It’s like: you’re a weirdo if you don’t drink.”“Humans are social animals, but we don’t like to be around a lot of people we’re not familiar with,” Abbasian says. “Socialising, going out on a Saturday, is anxiety-provoking. When you go to a bar or club, you drink to reduce anxiety levels so you can drink and talk to strangers. Alcohol disinhibits you.”Forced sobriety at least helps you to see things anew, in a clear-eyed way. “I notice everything on nights out – I’m not blind to things any more,” Marshall says. “Even with some of my friends, I think: you turn into a wanker when you’re drunk.”Abbasian says: “If alcohol were a relatively new drug introduced into our society, and not as socially acceptable, it would be a class A drug, similar to heroin or cocaine.” He urges those who regularly binge drink to seek assistance, before it’s too late. “There’s a lot of stigma and denial. A major first step is to accept you have a problem and not be ashamed getting help and treatment.”All the people I spoke to wanted me to share their experiences. In fact, many of them reached out to me, desperate to warn others.“My message is: be careful,” Charles says. “Just because you’re young and you only go on weekend benders, and don’t drink every day, doesn’t mean you’re invincible. Because you’re not.”And the next time you drop a crate of sticky bottles off at a recycling bank, Peters would ask that you remember him and reconsider your drinking. “If just one person can read this and think that, it would be enough for me,” he says. “Just to make a difference to that person and their family. It would be my whole life’s work complete for me. I would be over the moon.”Drinkaware is an independent UK charity working to reduce alcohol misuse and harm.

The audience was greying, supportive and eager to join in with It’s All Over Now Baby Blue, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down and The Boxer, the song with which she concluded her 100-minute set.Whether this extended tour will be her last is another matter – the programme contains a flyer advertising dates in London next year: there could be quite a few final bows. Baez, now 77, has been performing for 60 years and isn’t going quietly.Baez is 77 and her voice, as she freely admits, is not what it was. That outrageously pure soprano is long gone, replaced by a lower, less reliable instrument, skilfully deployed on her recent album Whistle Down the Wind, a self-conscious statement of survival, her first disc for 10 years and, she says, possibly her last. Her set was a clever combination of songs from the new disc and classics – Phil Ochs’ glorious There But for Fortune, Bob Dylan’s Farewell Angelina, a powerful rendition of Woody Guthrie’s Deportee (as relevant now as it was 70 years ago, she pointed out), a less successful version of Joe Hill with a curious rolling piano accompaniment by multi-instrumentalist Dirk Powell. There was also a slow, more-wistful-than-angry Diamonds \u0026amp Rust, her great lament fordemolition of her former lover Dylan. It was a tribute to the new songs, including the angry eco-protest Another World and the heartfelt The President Sang Amazing Grace, a modern civil rights song echoing the struggles of the 1960s - recited rather than sung - , that they didn’t pale in that exalted company.Her protege, Grace Stumberg, accompanied her on Diamonds \u0026amp Rust, and the power and flexibility of the younger woman’s voice sometimes emphasised the decline of Baez’s own. But that was the point really: none of us are what we were, but we are still standing, still fighting, still singing. “Ten years ago  I bought you some cufflinks  You brought me something  We both know what memories can bring  They bring diamonds and rust,” she sang back in the 1970s. At the Albert Hall, that famous doomed relationship forever receding, “10 years” became “50 years”. It’s been a long, sometimes painful journey, but Baez was here, beautiful and assured to proclaim victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d9d2bf7edb2942d60d194777ce5b32ccead8e5/0_44_1798_1078/master/1798.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db58ba5270d4fb116e1c83238c16b12","title":"off the wall pin up posters from glam to new wave","story":"From David Bowie to X-Ray Spex, Richard Hell to Suzi Quatro, a new book collates some of the best posters of the 1970s and 80s to be tacked up in teenage bedrooms everywhere"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/231e64ae43e62061b5d85be1bb1fdc36bdc9fe79/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=749f88b8e300dd5b16840759f09d7daa","title":"wilderness 360 immersive journey into patagonia vr","story":"The wilderness of Patagonia – a region in the southernmost tip of South America that is shared by Argentina and Chile – has frequently been under threat.

Bartley has previously said he does not wish to be sole leader, and it is possible he could seek a joint ticket with another candidate. Other contenders could include Siân Berry, a member of the London assembly, and Cleo Lake, a Bristol councillor newly made the city’s lord mayor.Lucas became the Greens’ first leader in 2008 after the party dropped its previous system of two “principal speakers”, and she increased her prominence further when she became an MP in 2010. She was replaced as leader by Natalie Bennett, who endured a difficult 2015 general election, after which Lucas and Bartley took over.Lucas said she and Bartley had stabilised the party since then and introduced “a far greater culture of professionalism” during a period in which the party’s vote share was squeezed as Labour moved to the left.“It’s no secret that we knew Jeremy Corbyn was going to take a lot of the space that we’ve been carving out for ourselves, so these were going to be challenging times and perhaps it was more important than ever to have at least one of our leaders in parliament,” she said. In an article for the  explaining her decision, Lucas argues she and Bartley are leaving the party in an improved position. “We focused relentlessly on electing Greens across the country. That’s meant more train journeys for me and Jonathan than I care to recall – which might explain why we’re both so passionate about public ownership of the railways,” she writes.“The effects are already clear – our best local election results ever earlier this month, bringing the Green party to every corner of this country, and seeing us break on to new councils as erse as Birmingham, Burnley and Richmond. The polls have now seen us overtake Ukip, and we’re closing in on the Lib Dems too.”When it was announced that she and Bartley would lead jointly, the idea was mocked by many. Lucas said another achievement had been to show this could work: “I think we’ve really demonstrated something very important with this model. I remember a lot of people saying this isn’t going to work. I think we’ve demonstrated that it is not only workable but positively desirable and effective.”She said this time she would not return. “I make it a point of principle never to rule anything out, but I cannot conceivably imagine at the moment any circumstance in which the party would be asking me to come back for a third time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d27b161f1d2cd21e00da38449786c0875a9f289/0_0_5526_3316/master/5526.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc4a61e92ddbf3ece9f0ef1bc0a1ae9d","title":"chris froome cycling bernard hinault giro ditalia","story":"• Team Sky hit back, calling for fairness over FroomeBernard Hinault has launched a stinging attack on Chris Froome, claiming the Team Sky rider should never have been on the Giro d’Italia start line owing to his anti‑doping battle.Froome joined Hinault and Eddy Merckx by becoming the third man in history to win three consecutive grand tour titles. The 32-year-old executed an extraordinary comeback to win the Giro d’Italia and add to his Tour de France and Vuelta a España victories from last year. Hinault claims Froome’s name should not be uttered alongside his own. “Froome does not belong on that list,” the 63-year-old Frenchman said, according to the Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. “He should never have been allowed to start in the Giro. Why do we have to wait so long for a verdict? With what right does Froome get so much time to find an explanation? Is it because Sky has so much money?”“It’s a very complex case, with a lot of lawyers, a lot of documents, a lot of money. We will make our decision as soon as possible but we have no time. Everything is more complicated than usual in this case.”Froome and his legal team have been battling to rescue his reputation for several months since the  and the French newspaper Le Monde revealed he had returned an adverse test during the Vuelta a España in September.A urine test indicated he had double the permitted level of the asthma drug salbutamol in his system. It is understood Froome’s defence will centre on challenging the efficacy of the test. “This is all very sad,” Hinault said. “Froome is not part of the legend of the sport, because what image does he give cycling? He may also start the Tour later. It’s a real scandal. This has to stop.”A Team Sky Spokesperson said: ‘It is disappointing that Bernard is so outspoken given he has his facts wrong. Chris has not had a positive test, rather an adverse analytical finding for a prescribed asthma medication. As an ex-rider himself, Bernard will appreciate the need for fairness for each and every athlete.“And at the current time, Chris is entitled to race. This process would normally be confidential to protect the athlete and establish the facts. Unfortunately, it was leaked.“However, both Chris and the team are following the process that has been put in place by the UCI.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/251d2b9c2405b5c64e2d2e5a99ac06d7756303cf/0_310_5058_3034/master/5058.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deb8217c23c3fa87cd65fa0c1508e56a","title":"kyle edmund french open comfortable victory alex de minaur","story":"Kyle Edmund eased into this French Open on Tuesday with a three-set workout against Alex de Minaur that confirmed his status as one of his sport’s punishing cruiserweights, even if his opponent had the physical aura of a schoolboy.Napoleon, once of this parish, famously had a complex about his size, and bloodied a nose or two across Europe before the weight of his enemies crushed his ambitions. On day three of his second visit to Roland Garros, De\u0026nbspMinaur – yet to reach 11st, standing a tad under 6ft and one of six teenagers in the draw – stuck doggedly to a muscular game that shone in bursts but ultimately played into Edmund’s unforgiving hands.While Edmund took less than two hours to win 6-2, 6-4, 6-3, the British No\u0026nbsp1 acknowledged on court that\u0026nbspit was not as easy as the numbers might\u0026nbspsuggest.De\u0026nbspMinaur – the hustling young wildcard, who lives in Spain with his family and burst on to the scene in his native Australia in January – broke once from four chances but made inroads on his serve that stretched Edmund in the second set.“I played well, with intent,” Edmund said. “I knew the game style – me dictating the points, him making a lot of balls, forcing me to come up with the answers. I gave up too many points with errors in the second set, and double faults, but in the third set\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspgot it back.“Conditions were a little heavier at the start but, when the sun came out at the end, the ball was pinging off the court a bit more. Throughout the match my concentration was generally very good. It’s something that doesn’t come overnight, and he’s the sort of opponent who is really up for the battle if he gets a sniff.”Edmund has a day to rest before taking on the world No\u0026nbsp45, Marton Fucsovics, who defeated the Canadian Vasek Pospisil 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (5) on Court No\u0026nbsp12. The 26-year-old Hungarian is coming off a win in the Geneva final against Peter Gojowczyk, who was beaten by Cameron Norrie on Monday.This was always going to be a tricky opening fixture for Edmund, even though he is protected from the tournament’s bigger beasts for a while by his 16th seeding. De\u0026nbspMinaur, who hits and chases with a flourish, refused to back down at any stage, which was both his strength and his weakness.Most of his success sprang from machine-gun thrashes and determined running down of half-chances, but his potency dimmed as the lactic acid drowned out the adrenalin.He is Australia’s No\u0026nbsp5 and oozes promise. He has the rare gift of being able to compartmentalise the point, ignoring the one just wasted and embracing those left. He showed that tunnel vision when he was 3-1 down in the first set yet pushed Edmund in every rally, getting back to 2-5 before the favourite served out just on the\u0026nbsphalf‑hour.De Minaur, ahead in the serving cycle, moved through the early stages of the second set with renewed energy. He got break point in the second game but Edmund, unhappy with a line call,\u0026nbspwas fired up as he wrong-footed him with a rifled forehand on the way to a crucial hold.Edmund’s concentration dipped again and he found himself under pressure on his serve in the fourth game. But, as in the first set, he found the big guns when he needed them and levelled.His thin teenage foe struggled\u0026nbspto maintain his buzzing tempo and Edmund broke for 3-2. They exchanged breaks in a knife-edge stretch illuminated by some brilliance on both sides of the net, before Edmund regathered his composure to serve out for a 2-0 lead – about the same time as Rafael Nadal was wrapping up a tense three‑setter in the tie-break against Simone Bolelli, held over from the previous evening.Edmund still had work to do but there was always going to be more weight left in his punch. And only after being broken in the third did De\u0026nbspMinaur begin to fade, recognising perhaps that he was banging his fists up against a tank.As the sun finally shoved the clouds aside, Edmund held to love for 4-2 and despondency spread across De\u0026nbspMinaur’s young features, even as he continued to let the blows flow, the final one too long, bringing the fight to a merciful conclusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14e22808e89108555254ed849774a84f581f8ebe/38_307_1796_1078/master/1796.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0243f53b4be94933810f6e91923f7e3","title":"nimes new roman museum toga design france","story":"As the French city bids for Unesco heritage status, the stylish Musée de la Romanité shows off the extensive treasures of Roman NîmesNîmes’ spectacular Musée de la Romanité will open on 2 June in a €59.5m complex next to the city’s equally imposing 20,000-seat Arènes de Nîmes – an amphitheatre used for events such as the recent Great Roman Games.The new museum, which will have free admission during its opening weekend, was designed by Brazilian-born architect Elizabeth de Portzamparc, who has incorporated waxed concrete, aluminium, wood and glass into the three giant rectangular buildings, the largest of which is swathed in a toga of glass tiles and is in front of the Roman amphitheatre.Portzamparc sees the museum as a “Citizen of Nîmes” wrapped in its own toga. The folds and gaps in the “fabric”, formed by 7,000 angled, silkscreened glass tiles, are a dramatic visual motif and also work as a peep-hole into and out from the museum. Climbers will make maintenance checks on each tile every three months.An aluminium, helicoidal central staircase leads up towards the centrepiece of the museum, a mosaic depicting Pentheus (a king of Thebes) being murdered by his mother, which was unearthed during building works in 2006. In near-perfect condition, it was subsequently reconstructed, tile by tile, on the museum’s first floor. A frieze of headless eagles, marble busts, limestone nymphs and a sixth-century sarcophagus are among the other 5,000 pieces on display, many coming from Nîmes’ now-closed archaeology museum.Portzamparc wanted to create a democratic space, so the main building has a central thoroughfare heading into tiered gardens where everyone is welcome to wander, without paying to enter the museum. The hallway follows the line of the city’s Augustan ramparts, a section of which is left uncovered in the gardens.The museum has a huge range of hi-tech gadgetry: immersive projections, touchscreens, holograms, sound showers and interactive displays. It also has an auditorium, document rooms, cafe, giftshop, restaurant and huge roof terrace, from where visitors can see the nine hills of Nîmes and many of the city’s Roman buildings. As well as the amphitheatre, notable sights include the Maison Carrée, Tour Magne, Temple of Diana and Roman gates.• Open daily (except Tuesday) 10am-7pm (8pm July and August, 6pm November to end of March).

Unable to reconcile their differences over this insurmountable matter, friendships have come to an abrupt halt and families have been permanently torn asunder. The nation is in disarray. Common ground is nowhere to be seen. And all because people can’t work out whether Piers Morgan or Richard Madeley is the more spectacularly weird Good Morning Britain host.Sure, on the surface, Piers Morgan runs away with it. Ever since he debuted in 2015, Morgan has essentially treated the programme the same way your deaf grandfather treats an Amazon Echo, bellowing an impenetrable barrage of opinion and abuse at the top of his voice regardless of anything else that happens to be going on. Piers Morgan’s gone-to-seed Joffrey shtick is now so pronounced that his colleagues openly make hay with it, tweeting pictures of their own distant faraway stares whenever he so much as opens his mouth. For a while, he looked unbeatable.But now a contender has arrived, and he is glorious. Since first being brought aboard as Morgan’s holiday cover in the middle of last year, Richard Madeley has quietly carved out a niche of his own. Madeley isn’t as combative as Morgan, but what he lacks in aggression he also lacks in self-awareness. A one-man Accidental Partridge generator, Madeley is fast developing into Good Morning Britain’s real star. In his first week, he overcooked a link about quicksand and veered off into confusing tangents about Gaby Roslin. In March, he commented lustily on a weather presenter’s dress immediately before crashing into a segment about the #MeToo movement.And on Tuesday – and this might be what ultimately clinches his victory – Madeley prematurely ended an interview with Gavin Williamson live on air. Peeved that the defence secretary wouldn’t answer a question on some recent language about Russia, Madeley began to scrawl furiously on his script. “You’re not gonna answer, are you? OK, alright, OK, interview terminated then”, he barked like a stroppy teenager, while an African elephant aimlessly stumbled around behind Williamson’s back.It was all there. Drama, showmanship and, most of all, the sense that this was just the tip of the iceberg. Over the years, Madeley has essentially become a concentrated version of himself. You sense that all the golden moments of old – the Ali G impersonation, the time he shook his fist at his daughter’s mugger on live TV – have been inexorably leading to a moment like this. Whenever he appears on camera, Madeley gets to ride roughshod over Good Morning Britain. It’s a place where he’s allowed to indulge all of his whims and digressions, no matter how batty or grumpy they happen to be. If Madeley is suddenly gripped by an idea – and he often is – Good Morning Britain is now the place where it can rise up and consume him. Make no mistake, Morgan created this environment. Thanks to him, Good Morning Britain’s dynamic is now one where the male hosts get to bulldoze whatever boorish path they like and the – much more traditionally competent – female hosts good-naturedly roll their eyes at the damage. When Morgan goes away, Madeley fills this vacuum perfectly.The problem is that Madeley is better at this than Morgan. The latter is hamstrung by his need to constantly be seen as a capital-J journalist a man forged in the fires of tabloid publishing, doggedly seeking out the truth no matter how unappealing it makes him look. But Madeley’s training ground was daytime television, so he’s softer and more camera-ready. Where Morgan looks angry, Madeley just looks clueless, and cluelessness is much more palatable first thing in the morning.This might be premature, but it feels as if the competition is over. The Piers Morgan experiment was a noble one, but Richard Madeley is the T-1000 to his T-800. He’s slicker and harder to resist. Instead of punching you to death, Richard Madeley will creep into your room and shove a spike through your face. At this point, Good Morning Britain is his for the taking. Unless Good Morning Britain does something radical and hires someone more suited to the job. Someone like, I don’t know, a tomato on a stick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc58cbaecd43260faf8e5e1c7a6ecbcf17d05576/0_407_4438_2663/master/4438.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa111b0cf0c866faded926f9182977f8","title":"unpatriotic post facebook finally flee russia","story":"I was already used to abuse, but my post about a Russian military plane crash sparked a frightening campaign against meI can tell you what political harassment feels like in Putin’s Russia. Like many dissidents I am used to abuse, but a recent campaign against me was so personal, so scary, that I was forced to flee.Two months ago, a Russian plane transporting the world-famous military choir Alexandrov Ensemble crashed into the Black Sea en route to Syria. They were travelling to perform for pilots involved in Russia’s air campaign on Aleppo. I wrote a post about this on Facebook. I didn’t call for anything or insult anyone. I just reminded my readers that Russia was indiscriminately bombing Aleppo, without recognising that dozens of children were dying in those bombs, their photographs making their way around the world. I also called Russia an aggressor.In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and occupied parts of eastern Ukraine, starting a war which has left at least 10,000 people dead. Prior to that, Russia occupied part of Georgia with its bombs and tanks.After all these wars and deaths, I felt only one thing when I heard that the representatives of Russia’s military had died: indifference. But for some, expressing this on Facebook was not patriotic enough. And so it began.The first to speak out was Vitaly Milonov, a State Duma deputy who is famous for his homophobia and obscurantism. Milonov called on the powers that be to deprive me and Bozhena Rynska, another journalist who wrote an insufficiently patriotic post on Facebook, of Russian citizenship, to deport us and confiscate our property.Then Senator Frants Klintsevich spoke out, calling for us to be dealt with “according to the law” and assuring us there would be a “reaction”. And the campaign began to snowball.The General Prosecutor’s Office is now investigating Rynska’s Facebook post and she could face five years in prison. Meanwhile, there are pro-government thugs waiting outside her home, who try to break in from time to time. My home address has also been published on the internet, together with an invitation “to visit”. I have received threats to me and my family by the thousand – in my email inbox, on Facebook and by phone. Attacks and beatings against dissidents in Russia have been happening for a long time – there must be hundreds of such incidents now. They usually use baseball bats, crowbars or bottles. In September, the investigative journalist Grigory Pasko was left with concussion after an attack by unknown assailants in Barnaul. The day before he had been accused of being a foreign agent by a local newspaper.Covering dissidents with ink or faeces is another familiar intimidation tactic. Yuliya Latynina, a journalist, was recently covered in faeces and my activist friends have been covered in ink several times for going out on the street with anti-war placards. To cap things off, a pro-government ultranationalist TV channel, Tsargrad, recently released a list of the “Top 100 Russophobes” – I’m number 10, and I fought twice for this country. A country I no longer feel safe in. Arkady Babchenko is a journalist and author of Memoirs about Chechnya.

The left-leaning populist, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, leads polls for the 1 July election by double digits. Mexican political parties are showered with public funding and electoral laws impose strict spending limits in election campaigns. But inidual campaigns regularly race past those limits while illegal money can also come from corrupt local governments, businessmen buying future concessions and contracts, and even drug cartels.Until 2000, the outcome of Mexican elections were never in doubt as the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) ruled uninterrupted for 71 years. But according to the authors of the study, entitled Cash Under the Table, the advent of competitive, multi-party elections has increased competition and costs, especially as vices such as vote-buying persist. Analysts say the cost of buying votes has ballooned in what has become a vote-sellers’ market, and poor voters sometimes view their suffrage as an asset. Parties also spend enormous amounts to maintain patronage groups, which marshal the vote come election time.“This is systemic. It doesn’t have to do with one party,” said Luis Carlos Ugalde, a former head of the country’s electoral institute and an author of the report. “Elections are more competitive so parties require more money.”The exact scope of the spending is uncertain, though the authors pointed to troublesome signs such as an inexplicable increase in the amount of cash circulating in the economy prior to elections.Parties break the spending rules because oversight is minimal, fines are modest, and the country’s electoral tribunal has issued rulings appearing to forgive egregious examples of campaign overspending, the report found.“It’s a totally normal simulation, especially in gubernatorial races,” said Gerardo Priego, a former gubernatorial candidate for the National Action Party (PAN) in south-eastern Tabasco state. “In many cases, they check the small stuff and ‘don’t see’ the obvious and gigantic things.”Political parties in Mexico can only collect private donations equivalent to a small percentage of the total public moneys they receive. Such policies were meant to keep out shady sources of funding such as narco money, but has ended up attracting rent-seekers and politicians with few ways of being held accountable.“That’s why we have parties that don’t work,” said Federico Estévez, a professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. “They’re not responsive to society because they’re not dependent on society. All they depend on is the federal budget.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/517f7d562ee7c853e7334c443db983896671b5a2/0_163_3189_1913/master/3189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaea806b95ead0453dbbd90ada6a94bb","title":"rwandas 30m arsenal sponsorship divides opinion","story":"The deal with the football club will pay for itself in increased tourism, insist officialsAnyone confused as to why Rwanda chose to spend £30m putting its name on the sleeve of Arsenal’s football shirts could begin to answer their question by looking at President Paul Kagame’s Twitter feed.In common with many of his countrymen, Kagame is an avid fan of his “beloved club” and the president – who has been Rwanda’s head of state for almost as long as Arsène Wenger led Arsenal – has regularly offered his view on club matters over the past six years. To critics, the deal is an example of an autocrat who runs one of the poorest countries in the world indulging a private passion while subsidising one of the richest clubs in world football. But to Kagame’s supporters and some in the marketing industry, it’s a canny move that is already getting people thinking about the impoverished country’s tourism industry, which offers lakeside resorts and walks with mountain gorillas – with one expert estimating that the £30m investment could help to bring in £300m of new revenue.“Rwanda wouldn’t have occurred to me as a place for tourism, so perhaps you do need to shock people,” said Kelvyn Gardner, the head of international development at the Licensing Industry Merchandisers’ Association. “What you’re buying with sponsorship it’s brand recognition. Football shirts can be overmonopolised by things like online gaming companies, so it will stand out.”In that time he has attempted to transform the mountainous central African country into a prosperous nation. The capital, Kigali, is largely safe and clean, with a construction boom that includes five star hotels. Despite this there are few dissenting voices in the media, limited political opposition and it remains one of the poorest countries in the world.Much of the development work locally has been assisted by aid from western nations, with British and Dutch politicians this weekend complaining that they are sending money to a country that is now supporting a high-profile football team. Clare Akamanzi, the Harvard-educated chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, defended the agreement, saying the money for sponsorship came from a different pot from international aid. “Anyone who criticises our deal with Arsenal on account of Rwanda being poor or an aid recipient, either wishes for Rwanda to be perpetually so, or doesn’t understand that in any business marketing costs are a key component of a company’s expenditures,” she said, insisting the country is determined to double its revenue from tourism to $800m over the next six years.That said, the deal could be as beneficial within Rwanda itself as abroad. Premier League football is ever-present in the country, with countless radio phone-ins dedicated to the Premier League. Fans crowd into bars and betting shops to watch matches while local minibuses are covered in the colours of English teams – with the north London club among the favourites.“Many Rwandans, especially in urban areas, are fans of Arsenal,” explained Rwandan accountant Charles Sac, who is a supporter of Unai Emery’s side. “I think it’s entertainment and associated success involvement of black players in earlier years was a factor.”Sac said the reaction to the sponsorship deal had been positive in his country: “Rwandans were pleasantly surprised by the news and still excited.”As part of the deal Arsenal players will visit Rwanda to hold training camps, while the country’s logo will appear at the side of the pitch at the Emirates stadium and on the backdrops for post-match interviews.“This decision demonstrates Rwanda’s continuing reorientation from a francophone to an anglophone country,” said Timothy Longman, a professor at Boston University and author of Memory and Justice in Post-Genocide Rwanda.“The group that dominates Rwandan politics, society, and economics today grew up mostly in refugee camps in Uganda, They brought back to Rwanda with them a connection to many things associated with Britain, including Premier League football.”He speculated that while the decision “may be popular with the English-speaking elite in Kigali” many Rwandans could think of a better use for the money. Regardless, at least one person will be happy. Earlier this month Kagame delivered his verdict on Arsenal’s recent performance after they were knocked out of the Europa League by Atlético Madrid.He said the defeat “should not have been the kind of ending of an era” but insisted their recent lack of trophies was “long coming”.“Blame the owners,” Kagame concluded, shortly before his country signed the sponsorship deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7134430792c2368ff03e2cd68894e5a352816dd/0_95_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce6a0cb913c514d2ee31026fc5306ec4","title":"wednesday briefing north korea and us back on speaking terms","story":"Preparations for summit resume … Soros backs second EU referendum … and Roseanne axed over star’s bigoted outbursts Preparations for summit resume … Soros backs second EU referendum … and Roseanne axed over star’s bigoted outbursts Hello, it’s Warren Murray making sure you are fully informed this morning.One of Kim Jong-un’s chief lieutenants has been sent to Washington as the North Korean leader’s summit with Donald Trump looks like it could go ahead after all.

Photo: iStockChildren from middle-class families are more likely to outperform those from less well-off homes from before they even begin primary school, according to a major new study.An Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) analysis of how more than 9,000 children adjusted to primary school finds evidence of a significant gap in children’s language development as early as three years of age depending on their socio-economic background.At age five, children from disadvantaged backgrounds had more negative attitudes towards school, more socio-emotional difficulties and poorer literacy and numeracy skills than those from other backgrounds.The study also shows children from professional or managerial families are more likely to start school at a significantly older age than their less well-off counterpartsBeing older on school entry tends to give a slight advantage to children in that they have better language skills and fewer socio-emotional difficulties.The most common reasons given for deciding to defer a child’s school entry included a sense that the child was “too young” or was “not ready”.Overall, parents have been opting to send their children to school at a later starting age over the past decade, although the introduction of the free pre-school years has accelerated this trend.The proportion of four year olds in junior infants has dropped from 47 per cent in 2000 to 27 per cent in 2016-2017, according to the study.Prof Emer Smyth, the report’s author, said the development gap between children based on their socio-economic background was significant but not insurmountable.“Even at the age of five, important differences are evident in children’s wellbeing and skills,” she said. “These findings are a concern, but they are not insurmountable.”Prof Smyth pointed to findings which indicate the development gap narrows somewhat at senior infants for children in disadvantaged or Deis schools, indicating that targeted efforts to boost outcomes are working.Overall, the report finds the vast majority of five year olds are positive about school, look forward to going to school and say good things about school.The ESRI study, commissioned by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, is based on information gathered as part of the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study of 9,000 children.It examined children’s vocabulary skills, literacy and numeracy skills, as well as their attitudes to school, relationships with teachers and their socio-emotional skills.The research found that only a small proportion (4-5 per cent) of children often complain or are upset about school. The study showed that children start school with different skills and capacities and some children face greater challenges.The largest skills gap is between children with disabilities or special educational needs and their peers.In addition, boys have lower vocabulary scores and teachers report that boys are more likely than girls to have poorer literacy skills, negative attitudes towards school and greater socio-emotional difficulties.The report recommends a number of steps to help children in the transition to primary, such as better information from pre-school staff on a child’s skills and challenges.It also says increasing play-based activities could promote learning and engagement among young children. There is evidence that this declines in senior infants in many schools.Promoting home learning activities in the pre-school years could also help to prepare children for school life.

This framework is used to hold institutions accountable for their performance in meeting key national priorities. In some circumstances, colleges may have funding withheld if they fail to meet these targets.Minister of State for Higher Education Mary Mitchell O’ Connor said institutions are being asked to “create rich opportunities for national and international engagement to enhance a strong bridge to enterprise and the wider community”.The new guide provides advice on how to map, measure and report on a variety of engagement activities across research, teaching and learning, student and staff volunteering and public engagement. The State’s seven universities and DIT are already involved in the Campus Engage network. Kate Morris, the network’s national co-ordinator, said universities and institutes of technology were increasingly connecting working with communities to address societal challenges. “These collaborations enhance research and student learning and directly address issues of public interest,” she said.Boosting the impact of colleges on the wider community was first cited in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030. This endorses the civic mission of higher education and states that engaging with wider society is a key role for higher education. In response, presidents of the Irish universities and institutes of technology have pledged to commit their institutions to the enhancement and co-ordination of engaged research, teaching and learning, public engagement and student volunteering."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3513041.1527621230!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit aids surge in irish passport applications","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Department of Foreign Affairs has appealed to people to renew passports online.The UK’s exit from the European Union next year has “undoubtedly” contributed to a 25 per cent spike in applications for Irish passports, the Department of Foreign Affairs has said.The number of applications in the first four months of this year has increased by 25 per cent when compared with the figures for the same period in 2016.The department said the Passport Office, which falls under its remit, was currently experiencing “peak season”, adding that the number of applications received is up by 10 per cent compared with last year, continuing a recent trend.Each year, the Passport Office recruits additional temporary staff to assist with the seasonal increase in applications. This year, sanction was received for 220 temporary clerical officers to assist permanent staff in processing applications.“The increase in the volume of applications is undoubtedly in part influenced by Brexit-related demand, with around 10 per cent of all applications this year from applicants living in Great Britain,” the department said in response to queries.“However, there are also other drivers of demand, including a trend towards early renewal of passports, a growth in outbound travel, and a growing population.”As of the end of April, more than 276,000 passports had been issued since the turn of the year. In the same period, 39,000 passport applications were received from applicants residing in Northern Ireland, and more than 41,000 were received from applicants residing in Britain.The department said that in addition to taking on temporary staff, the Passport Office was working to improve services, including plans to expand the online renewal project, as part of its response to increasing application volumes. It said iniduals seeking to renew their passport should do so online, as waiting times for this service had been reduced significantly in recent years.“Adults renewing their passports are strongly encouraged to renew their passport online,” it said. “The online passport application service is fast, convenient and secure, and is processing applications in 10 working days, plus postage time.“In fact, in 50 per cent of cases, the processing time is currently down to five working days. “Applicants can apply from anywhere in the world, with no need for a paper form, witness or printed photos. Renewal applications received through Passport Express are currently processed in 16 working days.”It also said that applications from first-time applicants, as well as from those with loststolen passports, take longer to process.“For these categories of applications, robust identity verification and entitlement checks, as well as vital fraud and security procedures, are necessary to ensure that the integrity and security of the Irish passport is maintained,” it said. “These checks take additional time to complete.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"clare daly gives impassioned testimony on referendum result in the dail","story":"  May 29, 2018TD applauded by colleagues after impassioned speech during first D\u0026aacuteil sitting since referendum "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3513150.1527627541!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord clare daly reminds d%C3%A1il of the real agents of change","story":"TD Clare Daly brought the Dail to applause with a statement on the importance of the abortion referendum result and the people who deserve credit for it. Video: Oireachtas TV \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClare Daly, the Independents4Change deputy from Dublin Fingal, has been the most compelling voice of recent times in Dáil Éireann in the fight for abortion rights.So they have been on their journeys and are now in that place called Enlightenment and it’s a big relief to be able to move on.But not quite yet.As this was the first Dáil sitting since the voters, by a massive majority, opted to allow Irish women deal with their own pregnancies on their own terms, there was more talking to do. Statements on the outcome of the referendum were duly scheduled so TDs could repeat for the parliamentary record what has already been said countless times since the votes were counted on Saturday.As it turned out, the only speakers were from the Yes side. That will change as the vanquished custodians of women’s reproductive choice get second wind. Tuesday was just too soon for them after such a crushing defeat. But before the statements, came the statements. Leaders’ Questions was devoted almost entirely to the referendum result and what should happen next. The exception was Danny Healy-Rae, a passionate anti-abortion voice in the House during the campaign, who found something far more important to talk about now that the results of the Kerry jury are in and the Kingdom voted to repeal. But the Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and Labour leaders did their thing, congratulating the groups from civic society behind the winning campaign. They are all too aware that these grassroots activists schooled the career politicians – and their media Boswells – in the art of listening and responding to the needs and will of the people.There was praise for the Citizens’ Assembly – its conclusions on the abortion question were mirrored by the national vote. There was praise for the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment which, when similarly presented with unemotional fact, produced a similar set of findings. Much praise too for Senator Catherine Noone who chaired it – she had to put up with some terrible playacting from a couple of committee members during the hearing. And most of all, much praise for all those women who opened their hearts and told deeply personal stories of life, love and loss.The legislation can’t be done quick enough. Upon that, all were agreed. The Taoiseach agreed too, after agreeing with everything his fellow leaders had to say. There was recognition for those activists – mostly women – who tirelessly campaigned for women’s abortion rights since the 1980s. The Taoiseach made a point of mentioning TDs in the Dáil “who spoke out on the issue of abortion when it was not easy to do so”.Women are still leaving the country to have terminations. It was agreed by all that the legislation righting that wrong will have to be completed as speedily as possible, even if it means sitting during the summer recess. There was no sign of Mattie McGrath during Leaders’ Questions or the Order of Business or while the statements on the referendum were happening. But it shouldn’t take long before the Tipperary Independent has the wind back in his battered sails. It was good to see such a cross-party consensus and collegiality in the Dáil, with people generously crediting political rivals for parts they played in bringing about the repeal. Although nothing new was said by the politicians, who have been saying a lot in recent weeks. But one member of the Dáil, while working tirelessly on the ground during the campaign, kept herself out of the limelight when her colleagues were publicly welcoming the popular vote and lavishing praise on the public for delivering such a decisive margin. Some of them must be very sore this week from their bandwagon jumping and selfie exploits.Clare Daly, Independents4Change deputy from Dublin Fingal, has been the most compelling voice of recent times in Dáil Éireann in the fight for abortion rights. She not only talked the talk and walked the walk, but came up with legislation to try and move on the situation.When she rose to speak, the chamber hushed. There weren’t too many TDs there, although most of the female deputies were present.The Taoiseach, party leaders and a handful of TDs listened intently as she gave an impassioned welcome to the result and dealt out a much-needed reality check to the political bluebloods who are now the most ardent champions of the cause.“Abortion has been there as an issue all my adult life,” she said, voice trembling with emotion as she described how the result was like having an enormous weight lifted from her shoulders. “A ball and chain that dogged us all our adult life being finally gone and I can’t believe that I’m 50 years of age and it’s taken this long.”She spoke of how her daughter came home to cast her first vote “to get us here”. It was like society atoning for everything it’s done to women. Back in 2012, with Mick Wallace and Joan Collins, when she first introduced abortion legislation, only 20 deputies supported them. But then brave women came out and told of their pain and tragedies and helped create “a social movement that changed history”.These are the “glory days” now. But it wasn’t always like this. Daly paid a special tribute to Ailbhe Smyth, the veteran campaigner – “a giant in terms of this movement” who “has stood there when there was no glory to be had”.But she also commended the Taoiseach and Minister for Health Simon Harris for their roles, spurred along, she suspected by Katherine Zappone and FG backbencher Kate O’Connell. (She might also have mentioned Marcella Corcoran-Kennedy from Offaly, who took some terrible barracking from male colleagues at the parliamentary party when she spoke in support of choice.)But Daly wasn’t letting them away too lightly.“Let’s be honest here, right,” she began. “Politicians haven’t led on this issue. We haven’t even followed until recently.”The long, uphill battle was like pushing a boulder up a hill for decades “and nobody in here was involved in pushing it up. Let’s be honest about it, for once, can we? Nobody was. In actual fact, a lot of people in here were sitting on the boulder making it even more difficult for those outside who wanted to push for change.”And then she called out the others who, once the boulder crested the summit, jumped ahead of it to try claim some of the glory.They were at it again on Tuesday. “People trying to out-posture each other into who’s going to be the most radical. “Sure we’ll cancel all holidays between now and forever. Let’s bring legislation in tomorrow. Sure we’ll bring it in yesterday. It’s a nonsense, lads. Can we please just cop on with the games?”Nobody said a contradicting word. They sat there and took their medicine because they knew Clare Daly was telling the truth. Voice cracking, she finished by thanking the young people who voted. “I was one of those students years ago and we never, we didn’t succeed in changing the world but I really hope that this generation does . . . They’re the legends out of this and I hope they make a better job of changing the world than we did.”And she sat down just before the tears came. Mick Wallace was bawling like a baby. The chamber broke into applause as the two cried. Slowly, TDs drifted outside. “Did you hear Clare’s speech?” they asked people they met. And so to Danny Healy-Rae. He spoke about “demountable homes” and rural cottages.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks. We’ll take it from here.”Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Family of saved boy thank Malian \u0026#39Spider-Man\u0026#39 Mamoudou Gassama, as \u0026#39true hero\u0026#39 receives French residencyFears of snap election in Italy as caretaker prime minister called to meeting with presidentChaos in Dartford as bus ploughs into dozens of vehicles leaving 14 injuredComment: I’m driven to distraction by Simon Mayo and Jo Whiley\u0026#39s Radio 2 showComment: For European voters, Italy is the latest example of the EU stripping the people out of democracyPolice to treat gangs like terror suspects with tough new lawsComment: Sorry, David Lammy, but more grammars means more ersityRoseanne blames offensive Twitter outburst on sleep medication as she returns to social mediaDonald Trump returns to campaign trail and discredited promise to make Mexico pay for border wall Kim Jong-un unlikely to give up nuclear weapons but may open burger joint, according to CIA assessmentBritish passenger dies after falling from plane at Turkish airportGirl saved from forced marriage by Apple\u0026#39s Find My iPhone appBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi-final 2 : Essential viewing -

I’ve been growing grapes for 33 years and this is the worst storm I’ve ever seen. Last year we lost 40 per cent of our crop to hail but this year it’s going to be an even worse disaster.”A series of storms in the Bordeaux region has ruined dozens of vineyardsStéphane Travert, the agriculture minister, said the government was assessing the extent of losses and would aid wine producers. “We’ll take the necessary measures and we’re ready to meet Bordeaux winemakers,” he said.Franck Jullion, the head of the producers’ association in the “Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux” appellation, said: “It’s a desolate vista, as if the vines had gone back to winter. Estates hit by frost last year will not recover.

President Emmanuel Macron has backed them, saying he drinks wine at lunch and dinner. He has infuriated doctors by minimising public health concerns over wine and arguing that spirits and beer pose more of a problem because they are favoured by binge-drinkers.Please review our commenting policyFamily of saved boy thank Malian \u0026#39Spider-Man\u0026#39 Mamoudou Gassama, as \u0026#39true hero\u0026#39 receives French residencyFears of snap election in Italy as caretaker prime minister called to meeting with presidentChaos in Dartford as bus ploughs into dozens of vehicles leaving 14 injuredComment: I’m driven to distraction by Simon Mayo and Jo Whiley\u0026#39s Radio 2 showComment: For European voters, Italy is the latest example of the EU stripping the people out of democracyPolice to treat gangs like terror suspects with tough new lawsComment: Sorry, David Lammy, but more grammars means more ersityRoseanne blames offensive Twitter outburst on sleep medication as she returns to social mediaDonald Trump returns to campaign trail and discredited promise to make Mexico pay for border wall Kim Jong-un unlikely to give up nuclear weapons but may open burger joint, according to CIA assessmentBritish passenger dies after falling from plane at Turkish airportGirl saved from forced marriage by Apple\u0026#39s Find My iPhone appBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi-final 2 : Essential viewing - albeit not entirely for the right reasonsRogue bosses who hound public with millions of cold calls face fines of up to £500,000Slap higher VAT on unhealthy foods to combat obesity, MPs say More than 1 million patients forced to get a new GP after seven-fold rise in practice closures New \u0026#39door-to-door\u0026#39 rail fares will combine trains and taxis in one ticketThieves steal golf club chairman’s buggy and drive it to McDonald\u0026#39sAnswer to curse of Japanese knotweed: It can be \u0026#39eaten into submission\u0026#39, says former Gardener\u0026#39s World presenterWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"prosecco no longer considered luxury experts say","story":"Sales of the Italian fizz have boomed in recent years as it successfully overtook Champagne as a toast at weddings, birthdays and other special occasionsBritain has reached peak prosecco because it is no longer seen as a luxury, figures suggest.Sales of the Italian fizz have boomed in recent years as it successfully overtook champagne as a toast at weddings, birthdays and other special occasions.But now, for the first time, prosecco\u0027s seemingly unstoppable climb is slowing, according to accountancy group UHY Hacker Young.Last year saw the smallest sales rise since 2011, amid a rising cost of imports from Italy and France because of sterling\u0027s weakness, it found.Some 35.8 million gallons of sparkling wine were sold during the past year, an increase of 5 per cent on the previous 12 months.UHY Hacker Young suggested that prosecco may be suffering from brand overexposure through overstocking at supermarkets.Prosecco has lost its luxurious edge due to over marketing in supermarkets, experts saySpokesman James Simmonds said: A five per cent increase in sales is not at all bad but that comes after several years of double-digit growth.Unless the industry can revitalise its image this year, we may now be reaching \u0027peak prosecco\u0027. It is hard for a luxury product to make the leap into the mass market without losing its reputation for exclusivity.A lot of English wine producers are now vying to capture the space left, as prosecco moves to the mainstream.Meanwhile the English wine market is booming and gearing up to give prosecco and champagne a run for their money in the global market.Partly fueled by business experts looking for a change of scenery, a record 64 new wine producers and vineyards launched their businesses last year, a 73pc increase compared to 2015.Crémant vs crémant - the new fizz warsWine producers in England are expected to plant more than 1 million vines over the next 12 months, which will result in some 2 million more bottles of English wine being made each year, according to data from industry body English Wine Producers.Also gaining popularity are French crémant sparkling wines, which have muscled in on the party circuit and are challenging the domination of the old favourite fizzes.In the first two months of the year Waitrose saw its crémant sales increase by 28 per cent on last year, peaking on Valentines Day as shoppers opted for it as an alternative to other bubbly.Family of saved boy thank Malian \u0026#39Spider-Man\u0026#39 Mamoudou Gassama, as \u0026#39true hero\u0026#39 receives French residencyFears of snap election in Italy as caretaker prime minister called to meeting with presidentChaos in Dartford as bus ploughs into dozens of vehicles leaving 14 injuredComment: I’m driven to distraction by Simon Mayo and Jo Whiley\u0026#39s Radio 2 showComment: For European voters, Italy is the latest example of the EU stripping the people out of democracyPolice to treat gangs like terror suspects with tough new lawsComment: Sorry, David Lammy, but more grammars means more ersityRoseanne blames offensive Twitter outburst on sleep medication as she returns to social mediaDonald Trump returns to campaign trail and discredited promise to make Mexico pay for border wall Kim Jong-un unlikely to give up nuclear weapons but may open burger joint, according to CIA assessmentBritish passenger dies after falling from plane at Turkish airportGirl saved from forced marriage by Apple\u0026#39s Find My iPhone appBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi-final 2 : Essential viewing - albeit not entirely for the right reasonsRogue bosses who hound public with millions of cold calls face fines of up to £500,000Slap higher VAT on unhealthy foods to combat obesity, MPs say New \u0026#39door-to-door\u0026#39 rail fares will combine trains and taxis in one ticketMore than 1 million patients forced to get a new GP after seven-fold rise in practice closures Thieves steal golf club chairman’s buggy and drive it to McDonald\u0026#39sAnswer to curse of Japanese knotweed: It can be \u0026#39eaten into submission\u0026#39, says former Gardener\u0026#39s World presenterWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000164866705_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"regular meetings ruin productivity workers worry running late","story":"Staff anticipating a meeting mentally subtract the time they have availableRegular meetings ruin productivity because workers are constantly worried about running late, a study has found.Staff anticipating a meeting - or people expecting a friend for dinner - mentally subtract up to 30 per cent of the time they have available.Scientists found that having created an unnecessary buffer “in case something comes up”, people perform fewer tasks, or smaller tasks, than if their next appointment was not looming over them.Researchers at Ohio state University’s Fisher College of Business asked participants how long they could spend reading an hour before an appointment for which they were fully prepared.  Respondents said they had 50 minutes available, and even said that subjectively it felt like they had only 40 minutes..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}You don’t feel like you can get as much done when you have a task coming up soon.

The WHO acknowledged however, that identifying all potential contacts remains challenging.  Since the start of the current outbreak earlier this month, 54 cases -  including 35 confirmed instances - of the disease have been reported, mostly in the remote areas of Bikoro and Iboko in the country’s north-west Equateur province. Twenty-five people have died. No new cases have been reported in the past two days. Although only a minority of cases have been reported in Mbandaka, the vaccination effort has to date focused on the densely populated city of 1.2 million due to fears the number of Ebola cases could rise rapidly in an urban environment.Dr. Salama said that take up of the vaccine among people deemed to be at risk of the disease has been high. “The vaccine is proving to be a very acceptable intervention to the community,” said Dr. Salama.He acknowledged however, that the WHO and partner agencies were “still at an early stage in this outbreak response”. He said: “We can’t conclude that we have safeguarded the city of Mbandaka.” Dr Salama did not rule out the possibility of further cases in the city.   The WHO is now expanding the vaccination campaign into the rural areas at the centre of the outbreak. On Monday, WHO began vaccinations in Bikoro, where the outbreak was first declared.  The WHO is also expecting to receive approval in the next few days from the government of the DRC to use five new drugs on patients in Ebola treatment centres. The drugs are all unregistered and will be used as part of a clinical trial.  Dr. Salama said that it was not a simple effort to do this kind of trial in this kind of environment. The WHO hopes that the trial will pave the way for future Ebola treatment efforts. Earlier this month, WHO experts concluded that the current Ebola outbreak did not constitute a “public health emergency of international concern. The health agency is however, continuing to monitor potential locations, including 80 ports on the Congo river in DRC and neighbouring Republic of Congo for new cases of the disease.The current outbreak in the DRC is the worst outbreak of Ebola since the 2014 - 2015 outbreak which killed  11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityFamily of saved boy thank Malian \u0026#39Spider-Man\u0026#39 Mamoudou Gassama, as \u0026#39true hero\u0026#39 receives French residencyFears of snap election in Italy as caretaker prime minister called to meeting with presidentChaos in Dartford as bus ploughs into dozens of vehicles leaving 14 injuredComment: I’m driven to distraction by Simon Mayo and Jo Whiley\u0026#39s Radio 2 showComment: For European voters, Italy is the latest example of the EU stripping the people out of democracyPolice to treat gangs like terror suspects with tough new lawsComment: Sorry, David Lammy, but more grammars means more ersityRoseanne blames offensive Twitter outburst on sleep medication as she returns to social mediaDonald Trump returns to campaign trail and discredited promise to make Mexico pay for border wall Kim Jong-un unlikely to give up nuclear weapons but may open burger joint, according to CIA assessmentBritish passenger dies after falling from plane at Turkish airportGirl saved from forced marriage by Apple\u0026#39s Find My iPhone appBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi-final 2 : Essential viewing - albeit not entirely for the right reasonsSlap higher VAT on unhealthy foods to combat obesity, MPs say Rogue bosses who hound public with millions of cold calls face fines of up to £500,000New \u0026#39door-to-door\u0026#39 rail fares will combine trains and taxis in one ticketMore than 1 million patients forced to get a new GP after seven-fold rise in practice closures Thieves steal golf club chairman’s buggy and drive it to McDonald\u0026#39sAnswer to curse of Japanese knotweed: It can be \u0026#39eaten into submission\u0026#39, says former Gardener\u0026#39s World presenterWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"cities highest salaries earn most world wage countries","story":"The world\u0027s\u0026nbspcities where earners take home the most money every monthEvery May, Deutsche Bank releases its annual “Mapping the world’s prices” report, cataloguing the cost of goods and services in a cross section of the world’s biggest and most powerful cities.To determine the cost of living all over the globe, the bank looks at everything from the cost of a packet of cigarettes to how much the average rent costs on a two-bedroom apartment.One factor Deutsche’s survey examines is how much people earn on average every month.

The figure, which deducts taxes, is a handy indicator of the wealth of a city.Broadly speaking, the cities that rank highly are in the northern hemisphere in developed Western economies, but southern-hemisphere powerhouses like Australia and New Zealand also feature.Unsurprisingly, people living in cities where the cost of living is high tend to have higher salaries, with financial centres like London, New York, and Frankfurt, Germany, featuring prominently. Wages in Frankfurt have risen more than $US200 a month over the past year, as banks look to move London-based workers to the city post-Brexit.The top echelons of the list are relatively unchanged from last year, with the top four cities the same as in 2017, albeit in a slightly different order.Check out the cities where people earn the most below. We’ve included any city where the average monthly salary is higher than $US2,000 a month net of taxesRead the original article on Business Insider UK. © 2018.

There is a rising interest\u0027Parents are raising funds to fit air purifiers in schools to protect their children from air pollution. More state schools are looking to install purifier units, which cost between £1,000 and £5,000 per classroom, amid growing concern about the impact of dirty air on children’s health. Last year, Notting Hill Preparatory School, a private school in west London, fitted high-tech air purifiers – and now parents of state school children are crowdfunding for similar devices. Parents should be banned from parking at school gates, charity saysChristian Lickfett, managing director of Commercial Air Filtration, which installs air purifiers, said he was working with state schools but most of his requests were from private schools. “Parents have a greater awareness of airborne contaminants and children are among the most vulnerable,” Mr Lickfett said. “There is a rising interest.”Parent Kimberley Hickman, who is raising funds to set up air purifiers in her son’s school in London, told The Times that it was unfair that state school pupils were less likely to receive protection. Speaking to The Independent, Ms Hickman, who has a son with asthma at Goose Green Primary School in East Dulwich, said: “Funding is always going to be tighter in state schools. It is a given.”But she added that local councils and the government have funding available to support environmentally-friendly schemes – including setting up air purifiers in state schools. “Once one school does it, you will see others follow suit,” said Ms Hickman, who works part-time at the schools as a fundraiser.  UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA view at Westminster Abbey from the medieval Triforium that is hosting an exhibition in London.

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It will decimate our public services and see household incomes plunge.“Those supporting it must come clean over the likely consequences of ‘no deal’, or they must stop beating the drum for inevitable economic ruin.”Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The prime minister’s official spokesman dismissed the criticism and insisted the government was actively planning for all Brexit scenarios.The spokesman told a Westminster briefing: “The prime minister has said many times, most recently in her Mansion House speech – we take the issue seriously and as a responsible government we continue to plan for a range of scenarios.“At the budget the chancellor committed an additional £3bn of funding so that departments and the devolved administrations can continue to prepare effectively for all Brexit scenarios, and over £1.5bn of this was allocated for 201819 in the spring statement.“That’s in addition to the £700m already made available to prepare for Brexit.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That amounted to 5.4 per cent of the government’s total stake.The stock is currently trading at around 290p, meaning the government would again incur a significant loss.The state paid a total of £45.5bn for the shares in 2008. The remaining shareholding is currently worth around £24.5bn.The government has expressed a commitment to selling off enough stock to ensure it is no longer the majority shareholder.But Labour said it “beggars belief” that ministers would consider a further sell-off when RBS’s share price remains so low.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for a further sell-off of RBS shares and it beggars belief that this government is considering selling shares at an even bigger loss to the taxpayer than the £1bn George Osborne managed.“All further sales of RBS shares should be halted, and the bank reorganised under public control to help provide the patient, long-term investment capital that businesses across the country so urgently need. The next Labour government will deliver a banking system that works for the many, not the few.”A Treasury source said the reports were “just speculation” and declined to comment further.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA view at Westminster Abbey from the medieval Triforium that is hosting an exhibition in London.

Boma also sees frequent and violent cattle raids from neighbouring states.As the rainy season sets in, much of the food people depend on has to be flown in from Juba, however this sustenance is unaffordable for many. A rebel fighter near the town of Kaya on South Sudan’s border with Uganda a day before the 26 August assaultThousands of rebel troops have been killed since civil war broke out in 2013SPLA-IO (SPLA-In Opposition) rebels pray in Yondu, the day before an assault on government SPLA (Sudan People\u0027s Liberation Army) soldiers in the town of Kaya, on the border with Uganda, South Sudan, August 25, 2017SPLA-IO (SPLA-In Opposition) rebels parade in Yondu, the day before an assault on government SPLA (Sudan People\u0027s Liberation Army) soldiers in the town of Kaya, on the border with Uganda, South Sudan, August 25, 2017SPLA-IO (SPLA-In Opposition) rebels parade in Yondu, the day before an assault on government SPLA (Sudan People\u0027s Liberation Army) soldiers in the town of Kaya, on the border with Uganda, South Sudan, August 25, 2017.

Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Since joining the US president’s legal team Mr Giuliani has made a series of notable television appearances.This includes making the bombshell admission Mr Trump repaid his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 payment to adult actor Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement related to an affair Ms Daniels says she had with Mr Trump in 2006.But Mr Giuliani was later challenged over how his statement appeared to contradict Mr Trump’s earlier denial of knowledge of the payment to Ms Daniels.Mr Giuliani responded by saying the talk of a $35,000 a month retainer was just “rumour” – despite him having said days earlier it was fact.The Republican also revealed the president recently ordered a hamburger – one of his favourite dishes – with just half a bun.He told The Washington Post the duo dined together on 6 May at the president’s golf club in Virginia.While Mr Giuliani enjoyed a light Cobb salad, Mr Trump, whose weakness for fast food has been widely documented, ordered a well-done burger with half the bun, a choice which The Post claims was “in service to his health”.“I do that, too, sometimes. It’s a good way to do it,” Mr Giuliani said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Thats what I want to do now.Both euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the UK.Euthanasia, sometimes known as mercy killing, is the practice of intentionally ending someones life to relieve their pain and suffering, while assisted suicide involves the person wishing to die taking an active role in ending their own life.Euthanasia carries a maximum penalty of life in jail, and assisted suicide 14 years.The only exception is passive euthanasia, which is where treatment that might extend someones life is withdrawn - such as a life machine being turned off.The only alternatives for terminally ill patients in the UK are hospice care or refusing treatment, which mentally capable patients have the right to do.As a result, some terminally ill people decide to travel abroad to die.She said she had always known her fathers wishes, and was not surprised at his request.It took seven months of planning to take her elderly father overseas, with the mum saying she felt that the clinic was professional and caring.Son Scott added: Its not pleasant to see your loved one die, obviously.It was a sense of relief for him.He was suffering and not facing a quality of life.The family said they were not worried about facing charges over Mr Lentons decision.Sandra said: I am prepared for that, because it was the right thing for my father.It has to be an individuals choice.But she hit back at suggestions that allowing people to be taken to suicide clinics would open the door to abuse.Sandra said: People are very clear about whether they want to do this or not.You cant pressure someone into this.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.THE calls for abortion reform in Northern Ireland are entirely understandable.It looks increasingly odd that its laws are so out of step with both the rest of the UK and now with their southern neighbour.But Ulster’s abortion laws have always been a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.For devolution to work, Westminster needs to acknowledge the right of the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to set their own rules.It’s not a pick ’n’ mix depending whether or not MPs agree with them.And the way some Labour politicians have suddenly become dedicated activists to drive a wedge between the PM and the DUP is shameless.The Government’s priority in Northern Ireland must be to restore a functioning Assembly, which has been missing for more than 500 days. Then the province can have an abortion debate.But it is for Ulster, not Westminster, to make any decisions.KYLIE Minogue has had us Spinning Around for decades. We wish the Red Blooded Woman a very happy birthday.If only we could all be So Lucky to look that good at 50.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Five years is an eternity in politics, especially in revolutionary times like the present.Ultimately, it’s up to the British people to decide what they want to do. It would be better however if they came to a decision sooner rather than later.He added that a second referendum would also render Europe a great service by rescinding Brexit and not creating a hard-to-fill hole in the European budget.Mr Soros continued: The British public must express its support by a convincing margin in order to be taken seriously by Europe.The economic case for remaining a member of the EU is strong, but it will take time for it to sink in.But he added that if the EU is serious about overturning Brexit, it should reform to become more flexible.Mr Soros demanded a multi-track Europe that recognises different countries want different levels of integration.Brexit backers today hit out at his comments and said a second referendum would defy the will of the British people.Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns said: George Soros wants to overturn the largest democratic mandate in British electoral history, but in the same breath admits the EU is in an ‘existential crisis’ and needs to change to convince the UK to rejoin.A second referendum would not only damage our negotiating position, but would also send a dangerous signal that Parliament is seeking to ignore the votes of 17.4million people.Mr Soros, a Hungarian-American who is the worlds richest hedge fund manager, has spent millions on political causes around the world.He has been accused of using his cash to defy democracy - but insists he is only trying to promote freedom and stability.After receiving his donation, Best for Britain has launched a national poster campaign and is lobbying MPs directly to support a re-run of the 2016 vote."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409633104.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"vegas stag do reveller urinated in his seat after airline staff refused to serve him any more booze","story":"Shane O’Grady, 30, became abusive on a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 flight to Gatwick on May 23.The Irish national was persistently disruptive throughout the journey, and used loud and foul language.After being refused more alcohol, the lout began harassing and intimidating staff, and became verbally abusive.Cabin crew tried to calm the situation down and placed the seat-belt signs on, but passengers were still able to use the bathroom.When O’Grady demanded the signs were switched off the cabin staff obliged.But despite this the drunk peed in his seat.Following the disgusting incident, staff were forced to hand OGrady a sleep suit – usually reserved for first class passengers – to change into.O’Grady was reported to police by staff on the flight, with officers requested to escort him from his seat once the flight landed at Gatwick.Sergeant Darren Taylor, of the Gatwick Prevention Team, said: “Gatwick is a very family-orientated airport, and we work hard with our partners to ensure the millions of passengers who pass through every year have a safe and enjoyable experience.“We engage with passengers at the earliest opportunity – through patrols, face to face contact and the distribution of posters and leaflets – to make them fully aware of the rules and their own responsibility.“But while the vast majority are well-behaved, there are always a few individuals who overstep the mark.

He will find out that it’s not that easy.”But it can also be revealed that Home Office bosses do fear 51 year-old Abramovich “buying” an EU passport from Russia-friendly states such as Cyprus and Malta.It is very difficult to exclude anyone with EU citizenship from coming into the UK.The source added: “If Abramovich bought an EU passport from somewhere like Cyprus, it would be very difficult to keep him out.“It would then be up to the EU to explain what they have done.”Downing Street also said that Israel’s visa waiver scheme would not give anyone the longterm right to work in the UK.The scheme only gives the likes of Abramovich half a year maximum here for leisure or business trips.His £8.6billion oil fortune means he has overtaken Israeli shipping and property magnate Eyal Ofer, worth £6.85billion.Israel grants citizenship to any Jewish person wishing to move there and issues a passport. Roman will also be exempt from paying tax for ten years, sources said.A No10 spokesman said: “Those with Israeli passports are non-visa nationals, which means they do not need a visa to come to the UK as a visitor for a maximum period of six months.“Israelis are required to obtain a visa if they want to live, work or study in the UK.”In a significantly tightening of the rules since the Salisbury nerve agent attack, it is believed the Home Office have demanded Mr Abramovich spell out precisely how he came about his £9bn fortune before his visa is renewed.The bureaucratic questions will take many months, in a retaliatory move designed to heap pressure on Mr Putin.Boris Johnson revealed the Government’s thinking during a hoax call with pranksters pretending to be the Armenian PM last week.The Foreign Secretary said: “I think it is very important for the Russians to know that the UK is absolutely determined to stand firm against them and we will continue to tighten the squeeze on some of the oligarchs that surround Putin.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whoever is holding one when the music stops gets called up on stage.The Lucky 13 are then suspended in a cage and given torches to shine back at the audience before being hidden from view with a cover and taken off the stage through a secret passageway.They are then told to run down backstage corridors to reappear in the back of the theatre clutching the torches they were given by Copperfield during the trick.But Mr Cox claims he slipped and fell 22ft from the door that lead back into the theatre, injuring his neck and brain.He testified: I was having a good time up until the time I was injured.Mr Cox recalled stagehands shouting Run! Run!

Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”. And it wasn’t lobbing David Seaman.You might think that at 38, Ronaldinho’s pneumatic drill was getting a bit rusty, but in August he is to “wed” both his girlfriends, Beatriz Souza and Priscilla Coelho, in a joint ceremony.More three-in-one oil, darling?We are told that Britain should rely on the “good faith” from Brussels.What good faith?When did Brussels ever show anything but contempt, disdain and disrespect towards this country after we voted to leave?The EU’s attempt to shut Britain out of the Galileo satellite project – which we helped to fund – is just the latest insult.If May wants to give Brussels £39billion without a trade deal nailed down, then she should resign today.And make way for someone who will finally stand up for this country.THE Labour Party has suspended local party representative Ian McKenzie for saying that Islamic State would behead Labour’s Emily Thornberry rather than using her as a sex slave.McKenzie, chairman of the Lewisham East constituency, does not deny his crass comments, although some suggest they are being used by his opponents on Labour’s hard Left to discredit him.It sounds like he is doing a good job of discrediting himself.HARRY KANE will be England’s youngest ever World Cup captain – younger even than Bobby Moore.Kane will do a fine job but Bobby Moore beat testicular cancer in his early twenties and then lifted the World Cup at 25.And for any England captain, that will always be a hard act to follow.HOW stark-raving mad that TV historian Dan Snow feels he has to lie to his daughters that women flew Spitfires in World War Two so they feel free to “follow their dreams”.“My daughter was walking down rows and rows and rows of these Spitfire racers and she was going, ‘Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy’,” says Snow.So to protect his six-year-old daughter from what he calls “the grim realities of pre-20th century gender relations”, Snow told her that some women also flew Spitfires in combat.And when I read of Snow’s bizarre lie, I thought of Violette Szabo, who was parachuted twice into Nazi-occupied Europe during World War Two to aid the French Resistance.On her second mission she was captured, tortured by the Gestapo and executed at Ravensbruck concentration camp in 1945.She was 23.Dan Snow has apparently never heard of Violette Szabo – because if he had, then he could surely have told his daughters about her.But many readers will know her incredible story from the film Carve Her Name With Pride.Violette was the working-class daughter of a French mother and a British father.She fell in love with a French Foreign Legion soldier of Hungarian descent called Etienne Szabo, who was killed in 1942 at El Alamein.Violette, who spoke fluent French, trained as a special-operations field agent to fight the Nazis.The torments she suffered before her death are beyond our imagination and her courage is at least the equal of any man who fought in World War Two – and I speak as the proud son of a Royal Naval Commando who won the Distinguished Service Medal.Educate yourself about Violette Szabo, Mr Snow.Then tell your daughters about her.WE all grew up as Star Wars fans but now it feels like there is always a new movie or spin-off coming out.The Last Jedi was only last year and this week sees the release of Han Solo’s back story, Solo. Talk about flogging a dead Wookiee.When Katy Perry is taking to the stage in a C-3PO mini-dress, the exploitation of the Star Wars franchise has possibly gone too far.We’re doomed, Katy.

It is perhaps facing a crisis of legitimacy - this is why we may see an escalation on the military front.Israel says the protests are being used as a \"camouflage for terror\".On Sunday it says its forces discovered an explosive device on the border fence.A Hamas position was targeted in response and three members of Islamic Jihad were killed.Israel was braced for retaliation. And it came on Tuesday morning.The fact that so many mortars were fired and that some landed in a kindergarten ramps the tension up further, which is why Israel\u0027s latest response has been so strong. The risk then for this breaking into a full conflict is great and the next few hours will be telling.However, there are strong indications that neither Israel, nor Hamas wants a full-scale confrontation.Hamas knows if there\u0027s another war, Israel will likely not stop until the organisation and all its \"terror infrastructure\" is destroyed.But for Israel to achieve such an outcome would involve having to send a land force into the Gaza Strip - and then deal with the post-Hamas humanitarian fallout and the nightmare of a restive and hostile population of more than two million."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-line-18-nick-martin_4323608.jpg?20180529152010 ","title":"line 18 skys nick martin explains why he is proud to be northern","story":"The North East has a proud tradition of heavy industry, not just building ships, but mining coal to generate electricity and landing fresh fish to feed the nation.I did not know it at the time, but I was born into a period of huge social and economic change - a period that would cause untold damage to the North, its industry, its people and especially its men.By November 1979, oil prices and rising wages led interest rates to soar to an all-time high of 17%.This crippled manufacturing and across the north of England businesses closed and national unemployment crept up to three million.:: How wealthy is your region? By the time the 1990s came along, shipbuilding, mining, steel production and coal had been pretty much obliterated.People like my father were either unemployed, working abroad or had managed to cling on to work locally.This turbulent period in British history was captured rather well in the cult TV series Auf Wiedersein, Pet, a comedy-drama about a gang of seven British workers escaping the mile-long dole queues in England to take up cash-in-hand jobs in West Germany.Men and their roles in society were changing in a way that would be depicted two decades later in The Full Monty, a film which told the story of a group of out-of-work steel workers stripping to make money and rebuild their self-esteem.:: Podcast: The changing face of the UK:: Podcast: What do robots mean for the future of work? When I say their roles in society were changing, I do not just mean they were at a loose end, I mean they were on a course to live shorter lives than men in the South.My dad struggled to find regular work, accepting short term contracts and working six days a week.By the mid-1990s, interest rates had reached 15% and a lot of families, mine included, were struggling to make ends meet.In March 1995, at the age of 48, my dad collapsed and died in front of me. I was 16.:: Sky Views: Journalists need to get out more:: Sky Views: The importance of remapping Britain I have spent the last few months working on a story about why, in 2018, men in the North are still living shorter lives than men in the South.I have been trying to find out to what extent this shorter life can be blamed on deprivation alone or whether there is such a thing as \"northern machismo\" - or an attitude that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.A doctor told me after my dad\u0027s postmortem, he would have had symptoms to suggest things were not right. I have often wondered why did not he say anything and I will never know.Almost all the indicators we use to measure deprivation are weighted towards the South, including life expectancy, heart disease, cancer rates, suicide, alcoholism, levels of tooth decay, literacy, road investment, wages and GCSE results.You name it, the North fairs worse. But how can this be?:: London is the most unequal place in the country Successive governments have either ignored the problem or deliberately diverted money to the South, where the perceived benefits to the national economy are greater.The reality is that the North-South divide is a black mark on the whole of Britain. It perpetuates inequality of the worst kind, pits regions against each other and neglects those areas of greatest need.Government policy has tried to direct funds through regional development initiatives, enterprise areas and grants, but there is very little evidence to suggest that these schemes have brought the economic prosperity intended.And Brexit won\u0027t help these areas either.:: The robots that could steal your job According to regional forecasts, every area of the UK will suffer a decline in GDP, with the North East taking an 11% hit to economic growth under the government\u0027s preferred outcome of a free trade deal with the EU.Leaving with no deal will result in a 16% dip, and staying in the single market would cause a 3% decline.These areas are as vulnerable today as they have ever been and things have to change.Governments have to take this seriously, otherwise we run the risk of damaging not just one generation, or two, but leaving permanent scars on whole swaths of Britain that have been left to rot because they are out of sight and out of mind."},{"url":null,"title":"bank holiday activities kids family","story":"AdvertorialFrom gazebos to kids’ tents – how to make the most of your outside space this bank holiday and half termHave a brilliant bank holiday with these ideas from Halfords\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByIan Morris14:23, 25 MAY 2018Updated16:39, 28 MAY 2018AdvertorialGet out and enjoy the upcoming time off\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailYou don\u0027t have to go to a campsite to have some outdoor fun this bank holiday. Your garden or local park can host just as much fun and help you keep costs down too. The trick is keeping everyone busy so the laughter flows and you all finish the weekend happy and re-energised. \u2028We’ve teamed up with Halfords to share some exciting ideas for what you can get up to – without breaking the bank. Get out into the garden  The key for any bank holiday weekend or half term is going to be fending off the inevitable boredom that can grip children – so why not put them in charge? They get to set the agenda, arrange the football tournament and decide if there\u0027s a water fight or not (there will be, so hide the garden hosepipe if you want to stay dry). To help them run the show, get them to help put up a tent to base themselves in.  The Secret Garden kids play tent and Rocket kids play tent are both ideal for getting their imaginations going. You\u0027ll also want to get the little’uns something to sit on, as they lay down the law of the garden. There’s even a Rocket folding kids chair and Secret Garden folding kids chair to match their tents.  Tents and a whole range of other camping gear are half price at Halfords for the bank holiday. Set up a grown-up place to chill  If the sun shows up for the weekend then you\u0027ll want to be able to find some cooling shade. \u2028While the kids are putting up their play tents, the adults can be busy erecting a sanctuary of their own – or kicking back in a Urban Escape King Size Moonchair, above. \u2028Take a look at the Halfords Gazebo with two side panels. Offering a UV rating of 50+ means not only will it offer shade, but it will also help keep you protected from the sun. \u2028\u2028  And if it rains? Don\u0027t worry, the gazebo is waterproof too. \u2028\u2028 A range of gazebos currently have 20% off at Halfords – check them out here.  Pack up a picnic lunch using a Halfords 40 litre coolbox – you can connect it to the mains or keep it charged in your car until you\u0027re ready, and then it will keep your food and drink nice and cool. It has wheels too, so no need to worry about getting it to your destination. And right now there’s 20 per cent off. You\u0027ll need cutlery, plates and something to drink out of too. The good news is Halfords has a four-piece set of acrylic wine glasses (it\u0027s your holiday too!) for just \u0026pound5. Rainbow plates and cutlery are also half price too, so grab the full set and make your park picnic bright and summery. Scoot to the park \u2028The kids can scoot on the Mongoose Stance Stunt Scooter, which is great for all wannabe daredevils. It\u0027s also down to just \u0026pound45 (save \u0026pound18), for the holiday weekend.  Or they can jump on the Slipstream Go Kart, a safe, fast and fun steel-frame go kart featuring wide pneumatic tyres for stability and a handbrake. The go kart, which also has a free wheel to stop pedals turning when going downhill, is now half price at \u0026pound70. Selected ride-ons at Halfords are currently half price.

The Help To Buy initiative is designed to help cash-strapped first-time buyers. But new analysis reveals the average salary of people receiving equity loans has shot up since it was introduced. Wealthy Brits earning as much as \u0026pound100,000 are getting taxpayer-funded loans to buy a home, official figures show. Those being helped earn an average of \u0026pound55,000.  And in London the average wage of Help To Buy claimants is now \u0026pound72,000 - three times the national average salary. Critics blasted the policy as “welfare for the upper middle classes” and demanded it be changed or scrapped. Help To Buy equity loans provide cash to homebuyers enabling them to own a property with a deposit of just 5%. Over the past five years, the scheme has paid out \u0026pound8.3billion - with 160,000 people benefiting from it.  New Government figures show the average household income of claimants has now risen to \u0026pound55,000. And 10% of those who have benefited earn at least \u0026pound80,000 a year. The average household income in the UK is \u0026pound25,700, although this is after direct taxes have been deducted, whereas the Help to Buy data relates to pre-tax wages. Labour’s Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey said: “With the number of younger people who own a first home in free fall, government ministers need to be doing much more to help people on ordinary incomes buy a first home of their own. “Deep cuts to housing investment mean that the number of new low-cost homes to buy like shared ownership have halved since 2010, and badly targeted schemes like Help to Buy aren’t focused on those who most need a hand up.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 8 writes list things","story":"NewsBoy, 8, writes heartbreaking list of things to see before he loses his sight to incurable diseaseFred Howe was born with a degenerative disease which will make him blind but before that happens he plans to meet Mickey Mouse and be a zookeeper for a day\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy Thornton22:00, 29 MAY 2018Updated06:52, 30 MAY 2018NewsYoung Fred Howe was born with a degenerative disease that will rob him of his sight and he has made a list of things to do before that happens (Image: Andy Commins/Daily Mirror)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn eight-year-old boy has drawn up a heartbreaking list of things he wants to see before he goes blind.  Fred Howe was born with a disease that means it’s only a matter of time before he loses his sight completely. But the cheerful “young adventurer”, nicknamed “Fantastic Mr Fred” by his family, refuses to let the condition stop him seeing the world. The youngster, who “loves looking at things” has drawn up a wish-list of things he wants to see and do. These include going up the Eiffel Tower, high-fiving Mickey Mouse, being a zoo-keeper for a day, getting up close to a crocodile, swimming with sharks and dolphins, and meeting a Bavarian mountain owl.  But top of his list is for his play-consultant mum Karen Newell, 47, and dad Dave Howe, 46, who have been engaged for more than 10 years, to get married. At present, Fred can only perceive light in one eye and see up to two metres in front of him with his other eye. He uses a magnifier at school and needs to be really close up to see things – even zoo animals are too far away. Fred is also learning braille and how to touch-type, so he is prepared for the challenges of the future. Karen, says: “When I see Fred at school with his peers, he is just like one of the boys. “But it is beautiful to see how they look after him. One will say, ‘there’s a step there, Fred’ and ‘watch out’, if a ball comes flying.”  Asked how long, Fred – who suffers from the degenerative disease, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy – has before he loses his sight, his mum says: “It could be tomorrow or two years time. “Puberty is a really dangerous time, so around 11 years old. “We want him to see as many things as possible, so he can remember them if he loses his vision completely. “We want to cram everything in and fill his visual memory bank. “Fred wants to see things up really close, but it is really difficult to get up close and personal, which is what he needs to do.  “He’s a mini explorer. He’s a very visual person, he loves looking at things. “But normal childhood things, like going to the zoo, are not as easy if you can’t see very far. “He is going to find life challenging, so I want to build up his resilience. “You have to live in the moment because you can’t change it. But in the back of my mind, it’s always a worry. That’s why we are trying to do as much as we can now. “There are lots of positive role models around. It’s the world that has to change, not Fred.”  Chatty Fred takes everything in his stride and says he is looking forward to having his own guide dog. “My eyes don’t work properly, so I’m looking forward to having a guide dog, so I can walk really really fast,” he says. “I think Santa should have guide huskies, too, because he’s getting old and needs help.” About his plans for the future, he adds: “I love animals, but its hard to see them in zoos. I would love to be a keeper for the day.”  And as for his travel dreams, he adds: “I see the Eurostar every time I visit Great Ormond St Hospital to see Mr Henderson and the horrible drops lady who puts stingy drops in my eye. “I have my picture taken by the Eurostar, but I really want to travel under the tunnel with the fish to Paris. “I want to swim with sharks, but my mum thinks it might be safer to swim with dolphins as they are kinder and don’t bite your bum.  “I like dolphins because they are very playful and I like sharks because they are really scary, but I won’t be scared because I am brave.” Fred was just six weeks old when his family realised something was wrong with his eyes, with a nurse noticing his eyes were “wobbly”. He was sent to an eye clinic and diagnosed a few months later.  “They said they’d never seen anything like this. I was devastated when he was diagnosed,” his mum recalls.  “But now we always try to look at it positively. The family, from York, first decided they needed to help Fred see more of the world after a trip to the Austrian mountains, where his mum and dad were engaged. Karen says: “When we went to Austria, he was absolutely thrilled by it.  “The skies were blue and there was snow falling. His face was a picture because it’s a place he’s always known to be special.  “Dave and I got engaged there and he’s seen the photographs of us looking happy and wanted to see it for himself. I’m so glad he has. “When we arrived at the top of a mountain he said, ‘wow, it’s a whole new world up here’. “He’s such a happy boy and he lives with this condition quite happily, but we know that as it progresses, he will lose more, if not all, of his sight. “Dave and I are doing our best to show him all the things that he wants to see and he’s drawn up a list of lovely things – from the complicated to the simple.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains biggest family expecting baby","story":"NewsBritain\u0027s biggest family expecting baby NUMBER 21 just months after parents said 20th child would be their lastSue and Noel Radford - who famously do NOT claim any extra state benefits aside from regular child benefit - revealed their big news with a video message and Instagram post of an ultrasound\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy Clarke-BillingsChris kitching14:10, 29 MAY 2018Updated20:41, 29 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe parents of Britain\u0027s biggest family are expecting their 21st baby just months after they said their 20th child would be their last. Sue and Noel Radford revealed their big news by posting a video message on YouTube and an ultrasound image of the unborn girl on Instgram. When the couple welcomed their 8lb 6oz son Archie in September last year, they vowed the little boy would be their last and they were happy to finish on a nice even number. But eight months on the family is set to get even bigger with a daughter who will be almost 30 years younger than her oldest sibling.  Sue, 43, and Noel, 47, who also have three grandchildren, wrote to their 47,000 followers on Instagram: We can’t wait to welcome you into the family precious little one. In their YouTube video, Sue tells the camera as she\u0027s in the car with some of her children: We\u0027re just on the way home from having a very specvial, lovely appointment. And I\u0027m just wondering if anybody can guess where we\u0027ve been. I bet you can. The clip then cuts to Sue at home as she shows off her baby bump.  She tells the camera: I hope you enjoy our gender reveal and, yes, I am pregnant. Sue and Noel, from Morecambe, Lancashire, then fire pink confetti into the air in the family\u0027s back garden to reveal they\u0027re expecting a girl. Noel says later: I can\u0027t believe it, a girl. I think we\u0027re in shock. We were not expecting it.  The parents, whose family featured in the reality programme \u002720 Kids And Counting\u0027, say they do not claim any extra state benefits aside from the regular child benefit. Sue and Noel have been having children for the better part of three decades.

Their son Alfie was stillborn in 2014.  After Archie was born, the couple said it was strange knowing he would be their last. When the entire family appeared on ITV\u0027s This Morning in January, Sue said: Archie is definitely going to be the last Radford baby.

Robinson, 35, was sentenced on Friday after protesting outside Leeds Crown Court - but Robinson\u0027s case can only be reported today after a judge lifted restrictions. The right wing activist was taken into custody for breach of the peace as he streamed an hour long Facebook Live outside the building, footage which was watched 250,000 times. His comments on the film had the potential to cause the collapse of a long-running trial at a cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds to the taxpayer. Details of the trial cannot be reported for legal reasons. Robinson\u0027s broadcast breached these strict rules and impacted on the defendants\u0027 right to a fair trial. Jailing him for 13 months, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC told Robinson: “No one could possibly conclude that it would be anything other than highly prejudicial to the defendants in the trial.  “I respect everyone’s right to free speech. That’s one of the most important rights that we have. “With those rights come responsibilities. The responsibility to exercise that freedom of speech within the law. “I am not sure you appreciate the potential consequence of what you have done. The judge said Robinson\u0027s actions could have meant a re-trial, costing hundreds and hundreds and thousands of pounds, Leeds Live reported.  The judge added: “It is a serious feature that you were encouraging others to share what you were streaming live on social media.” Jailing the married father-of-three, the judge said: “People have to understand that if they breach court orders there will be very real consequences.” Details of Robinson\u0027s imprisonment were initially subject to a court order banning any press coverage, but this was lifted today after representations from the media. Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was seen being led towards the back of a police van and searched in footage posted on his Facebook page. In a rare move, he was arrested, charged and sentenced within five hours.  His arrest sparked mass protests outside Downing Street over the weekend as supporters demanded his release. Police officers were deployed to keep the crowd under control. Many could be seen holding #FreeTommy placards, one reading Free the truth teller. Free Tommy. The protest eventually made its way down to Parliament Square. The Met Police said there were no arrests. In the footage of Robinson\u0027s arrest, he asks one supporter as he is led away: Can you get me a solicitor? I\u0027m on a suspended sentence, you see. One officer in the footage says before reading Robinson his rights: You are being arrested on suspicion of causing a breach of the peace.  The video footage was played to the judge as Robinson sat in the dock. Robinson, whose criminal record dates back to 2005, has a previous conviction for contempt of court. He was the subject of a suspended prison sentence, imposed at Canterbury Crown Court, after he filmed in court. He also has convictions for disobeying a court order, possessing identity documents with intent, fraud, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, possessing drugs and threatening behaviour. He pleaded guilty to contempt of court and breach of a suspended sentence.

Belinda Leach was making dinner when the bird appeared outside her window in Andreas, Isle of Man, last week with the foot-long rodent so the 55-year-old grabbed her camera. After two failed attempts to get the beast down, the gull eventually used its beak to \u0027tenderise\u0027 its prey - before swallowing it whole. Wayleave officer Belinda was stunned to capture the \u0027amazing\u0027 scenes on camera and says she would be pleased if seagulls are going to clean up the island of \u0027longtails\u0027 - as Manx superstition means they won\u0027t name rats.  However pet owners should be on their guard as Belinda believes small animals like family bunnies would be on the menu, and her own family have lost ducklings from their pond to seagulls. Belinda said: It was an adult rat so it was big. To swallow it down in one is pretty good going. It was amazing to watch, really brilliant. It took the gull three goes but in the end it was able to get it down in one. It was quite fascinating to watch. It tried to gulp it down head first and it wouldn\u0027t go down at first so it had to regurgitate it back up. The gull then deliberately crunched along the back bone a few times with its beak, almost like it was tenderising the rat, I guess, making it a bit more flexible. It was only on its third attempt and after about five or six minutes battling it, it swallowed it whole. I watched the back of the gull\u0027s neck change shape as it swallowed it. After gulping it down, the bird just flew off and sat on the chimney to look down on the world.  It looked quite amazing that in the end it only had that little bit of tail sticking out of its beak. It didn\u0027t phase the bird at all. It was quite confident. It didn\u0027t stop him flying at all, which amazed me. I thought he\u0027d need to hang around a bit to let it go down. The images show the rat\u0027s tail is all the remains sticking out of the gull\u0027s mouth once it has finished. However the bird\u0027s belly appears distended, while it\u0027s neck is swollen to accommodate the supersized rodent. Belinda said: Seagulls are vermin too so they will eat whatever they can get hold of but even so it was a bit of shock to see this one eating a large rat. It was clearly newly dead. I honestly can\u0027t say for certain that the seagull killed it, but it may well have done. The gulls will take all kinds of animals. They would take ducklings, young rabbits and so on but I never thought it would take on something of that size. We have ducks and a lot of wildlife in our garden and we have lost a lot of ducklings off our pond to them, but I still didn\u0027t expect this. The moorhens on our pond have been battering any gulls that come close recently trying to stop them nicking their young. They\u0027re very feisty mums but if they are not close to their offspring, the gulls will have them. We don\u0027t get loads of gulls but we are half a mile or so from the sea so we get a few.  However Belinda was pleased to see seagulls turning on rats, which she says Isle of Man locals are superstitious over and, like Lord Voldemort, will not say by name. Belinda said: We don\u0027t call them rats on the Isle of Man. I have to touch wood after saying that. It\u0027s a superstitious thing. On the Isle of Man they are either called longtails, queerfellows or we spell it out. Young people sometimes call them ringies because of the rings on their tails. But we do not say that word as that is bad luck. They are not seen as nice things so you don\u0027t refer to them as their name. I did not feel even vaguely sorry for the rat - I hate them with a passion. I love photographing wildlife but this was handed to me on a plate. I didn\u0027t dare step outside though as I think the bird would have flown off.

Ahmed Elgwahry even waited with them on the phone for an hour after he knew they had succumbed to the flames. Speaking slowly and calmly, he said he was on the phone to his younger sister, Mariem Elgwahry, 27, as she and mum Eslah Elgwahry, 64, took refuge on the top floor of the high-rise block. Mr Elgwahry described how he stood at the bottom of the tower and realised that running in to try to save them would have been an act of suicide. He told the inquiry on its sixth day of commemorative hearings: On my final call with Mariem, despite her suffering, despite her gradual deterioration, despite her gradual loss of consciousness, she persisted in letting me know that she was still there.  She started fading away from me rather rapidly, but she kept going all the way until she was no longer audible. She started to mumble, started banging the floor, and then finally no longer responsive. It was at this point I presumed I lost my mum at the same time. But then about 20 seconds later, for the first time that early morning, I heard my mum\u0027s voice. She was struggling for breath, and said her last words: \u0027I can\u0027t breathe, I can\u0027t breathe\u0027. That was the last time I heard her voice.  She was so frightened that she had not spoken prior to this. He disconnected the call more than an hour after their final moments, he said. All he could hear was the crackle of fire. Mr Elgwahry was given a standing ovation as he completed his testimony. He explained that months later, only fragments of their bodies were recovered by the coroner and her team, who attempted to piece them back together bone for bone, as if they were dinosaurs. Mr Elgwahry\u0027s father died years ago from an aggressive form of cancer, he said.

The ‘finger-licking good’ chicken giant, famous for Bargain Buckets and Zinger Burgers, are set to offer customers healthy sides instead of fries for free. They are also considering offering only low or zero calories carbonated drinks – and are to trial a vegetarian option later this year. But if you are a fan of KFC, there is no need to worry - because they won’t be changing the Colonel’s secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices. KFC hope the new menu will help customers towards their ‘five-a-day’ target.  By 2020, the company plan to have more lunch and dinner options available under 600 calories, in line with Public Health England’s recent campaign. The PHE want to encourages people to aim for 400 calories for breakfast, 600 for lunch and 600 for dinner, plus a couple of healthier snacks and drinks in-between. KFC made the announcement now to allow time to test various methods to reduce the number of calories in the current menu without compromising on taste. As part of the delivery of this programme, KFC is working with Head of Food Innovation, KFC UK \u0026amp Ireland, Victoria Robertson.  Nutritionist Victoria said: “We know people are more passionate than ever about eating well, and we face a big challenge in shifting their perceptions of what we offer. We’ve done it before, though – the success of our Riceboxes has shown that our fans will go for lighter options from us. That said, we know any new menu and recipe changes will have to be just as tasty as today. It’s a tricky challenge, because our fans absolutely love our Original Recipe chicken, and we won’t be changing the Colonel’s secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices. This is about providing choice, and offering delicious, signature KFC taste that just happens to be lighter.”  The menu changes will see healthier sides to help customers towards their five-a-day KFC has also committed that they will only launch low or zero calorie carbonated soft drinks to further their calorie reduction. Moreover, working with a series of partners, KFC will trial a behavioural change programme to help consumers make lighter and healthier choices. This will include encouraging customers to switch to healthier sides as an alternative to fries for free and low or zero calorie drinks will be served by default. Paula MacKenzie, General Manager, KFC UK \u0026amp Ireland, said: “I’m incredibly proud to be making this commitment today.

Digital minister Margot James is to announce today that measures to make company directors personally liable for up to \u0026pound500,000 in fines will be put out for consultation. The move was originally announced in October 2016, when Ministers announced the crackdown would take effect in Spring 2017. The new measures would mean companies and directors could be hit with up to \u0026pound1 million in penalties in the worst cases. Branding nuisance calls a “blight on society”, Ms James said the government was determined to stamp them out.  Currently, only businesses themselves are liable for the fines, which are issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Some directors try to avoid paying the penalties by declaring bankruptcy, only to set up shop again under a new name. The UK data watchdog revealed last week it had recovered just over half (54 per cent) of the \u0026pound17.8 million in fines issued for nuisance calls since 2010, as companies go into liquidation to avoid big penalties. The plan was originally announced in 2016, when Culture Secretary Matt Hancock, then Digital Minister, also branded nuisance calls a “blight on society.” He said it would be introduced in spring 2017, but it’s understood the policy was shelved after Theresa May called the snap election. The Tories’ 2017 manifesto committed to introducing the Data Protection bill, which updated the Government’s plans to deal with personal data. Ministers decided to delay the crackdown on nuisance callers until after the bill had passed through Parliament, which completed last week. But now the plans have been put out for consultation, which means they won’t be introduced until at least August. Minister for Digital and the Creative Industries Ms James said: “Nuisance calls are a blight on society and we are determined to stamp them out.

Smoke-free areas are expected to be in place in hospital grounds, schools and playgrounds by summer 2019. Strengthening the laws around smoking in public in Wales will further protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke and de-normalise smoking for children and young people, according to the Welsh government. While most schools and hospitals already have no smoking policies in their grounds, it is currently difficult for staff to enforce this.  Health Secretary, Vaughan Gething, has visited the maternity unit at Glan Clwyd Hospital, where staff told him they had received complaints from mothers about people smoking outside the hospital when they enter and leave with their newborns. The changes will make it illegal to smoke in the hospital grounds, with legal backing for fines for smokers breaking the rules, therefore improving the environment for patients, visitors and staff, says the government. Vaughan Gething added: I am proud that Wales continues to be at the forefront of UK action to reduce smoking and prevent young people from taking it up in the first place. We have seen significant changes to the attitudes to smoking since 2007.

But for these three friends, it’s a real celebration. The trio of young women – Lara Ferguson, Ellie Markham and Lizzie Nice – have all been at the brink of death after suffering from anorexia. But, incredibly, the disease has been their salvation too, because when they met at a unit for young people with eating disorders they forged a friendship that has given them a future worth living. “I don’t know where I’d be without Ellie and Lizzie,” Lara, 18, says. “Out of something so awful, I’ve gained two friendships I’ll treasure forever, and we’re all ready to make happier memories than the ones we have.”  At one point Lara didn’t know if she would live to make memories. Her \u0026shyproblems started when she was 13, and developed into depression and OCD, which all centred around food. “I started to hear voices, telling me that if I ate certain foods, my family would die,” she says. “I became convinced that food was poisoned. I’d always loved my food and was dubbed the ice cream queen because I loved it so much. I’d even mix peanut butter into it. But now it terrified me.” Although somehow Lara maintained a healthy weight, she began self-harming too. She even tried to take her own life. It was such a worry for her parents, Alison and James. Eventually she was taken to Sheffield Children’s Hospital, where she was tube fed and given anti-psychotic medication. “They made me put on weight, which made me feel uncomfortable,” she remembers. “But the worst thing was that everything felt out of my control.” So when she came out of hospital a few months later, the only thing Lara felt she could control was what she ate. “The only safe foods for me were Snack-a-Jacks and carrot mash, but it had to be the one from the Co-op,” she says. “I was losing so much weight, my parents were scared. “So when the Co-op announced it was discontinuing it, Dad drove around all their stores in the city and bought as many packets as he could.”  For Lara, the loneliness of anorexia was one of the worst things. She barely attended school, and spent all her time obsessively exercising in her room. It’s something Lizzie, 20, understands all too well. “Like Lara, I barely had any friends. All the girls at school were going out shopping while I was pacing up and down in my room for hours on end, trying to work off the watery soup I’d had for dinner,” she remembers. Lizzie says she was a very anxious child, and a perfectionist. “I became obsessed about ‘safe’ foods, like salads and soups. I’d always been a healthy size eight to 10 but the weight dropped off quickly. “It’s not about looking in the mirror and thinking you’re fat, it’s a control thing, something the other girls understand only too well. They know exactly how isolating anorexia is, which was why I think we’ve bonded so well.” Ellie agrees. “I was at uni and loving life. I was studying adult nursing, lived with five girls, had a great social life and was doing well at my studies. I couldn’t even tell you how or why it started. At first, I decided to cut out carbs. But this soon spiralled, and before she knew it, she was hardly eating a thing. “I didn’t have anxiety before, but I soon did. In the end, I had such little energy I had to quit uni. I was like a zombie.” The struggles they all faced though were immense. “At one point I was scared to even drink water,” Lizzie remembers. “I felt so poorly all the time.” She was not alone.  “I was cold the whole time,” Lara agrees. “Mum used to wrap me up in blanket after blanket to try and keep me warm. I had no energy, yet somehow would still find the strength to exercise.” For these three, the knowledge that they have all been through the same thing is clearly a source of strength. “It’s because the anorexia is stronger than anything,” Lizzie agrees. “I just had to keep moving the whole time. If I kept still, I’d be \u0026shyterrified I’d put on weight.” By August 2015, Lizzie weighed just over five stones. “Mum would insist on sleeping with me,” Lara says. “She was terrified I’d exercise at night and it’d put too much strain on my heart. “Sometimes I’d lie down and my heart would be doing funny things. One night I texted mum to say I didn’t think I was going to make it through the night.” All three missed out on huge parts of their lives due to crippling anorexia.  Lara started receiving treatment, which slowly helped, but she knew it was going to be a long journey. Then, in October 2015, she was at a treatment centre for young people with eating disorders when she met Lizzie and Ellie. It was a life-changing moment for all three girls. “It was somewhere you’d go for the day, have breakfast, lunch and dinner – a day service basically,” Lara says. “You’d come home at night, but during the day you’d be monitored with help at hand if needed. “And as soon as I met Ellie and Lizzie we just clicked. We were all very similar and understood how the others had ended up here,” she says. “That’s the thing with anorexia,” Lizzie agrees. “People don’t really get that it’s a mental illness. They say, ‘You aren’t fat, so why aren’t you eating?’ But only someone who’s been through it can truly understand, and that’s what bonded us.” Over the next couple of days the girls spent all their time together, reflecting on their illness. And the thing they all agreed about was how much they’d missed out on. “But we all vowed that we wanted to look forward, grab life and make the most of it,” Lizzie says. “We wanted to discover life again and to do that together.” On the third day of their friendship they came up with the idea of going out for pizza – something so normal for most teenage girls, but for the trio, it was a massive deal. “It was exciting, nerve-wracking and frightening” Lara says. “But as we all sat down and ordered, it was \u0026shyexhilarating too. It felt amazing to be doing something so normal. “There’d been a point I could never have dreamt of this, yet here I was, ordering a \u0026shypineapple and sweetcorn pizza!” Now, these pizza nights have become a regular event for the girls, who are all thankfully fit, well and enjoying every single day of life.

And the woman backed our campaign to change the system that appears to give more rights to criminals than those they target. Known only as DSD for legal reasons, she said a victims law would redress the balance by allowing them a bigger say in how crooks are dealt with at parole. The woman, who helped block January’s decision to release the 60-year-old sex fiend, plans to be at his review hearing in the coming months to read a statement. She said: “I have been in court now on and off for 10 years and at some point you have to say enough is enough but it’s never going to be over because every time he’s up for parole I’m going to be there giving a victim impact statement, trying to block it and he comes up for parole every two years.  “He wants it over, he feels like he has done his time but what about us? We can never turn it off and say right I’ve done my time. “My whole life has changed as a result of Worboys. I’m sick and tired of thinking about him and worrying if he going to be released. It should have been a case of he goes to prison and he’s forgotten about and it shouldn’t be down to the victims to stop things happening.” The new law would mean rapists and killers cannot be freed without their victims being told. It would also include the right to legal aid, which DSD and fellow victim NBV were not \u0026shyentitled to when they launched a judicial review to overturn the parole board’s decision to free Worboys. They won the review after not being told of his release, 10 years into an indefinite sentence for drugging and attacking 12 women.  She added: “All the way through, each department has been blocking me saying, ‘We can’t do this,’ and then we’ve gone to court and shown actually we can do this. “The Government is aware how badly the system failed us. A victims law would help to prevent that happening in future.” Speaking of the moment she heard on the radio about the \u0026shydecision to release Londoner Worboys, the mum said: “I felt like I had been kicked in the stomach. I just could not believe this was happening.” Worboys was never prosecuted over his 2003 attack on DSD, after appalling failings by Scotland Yard. It was the first time he was reported to police, meaning up to 200 women could have been protected if officers had acted.

She originally started eating a bodybuilder’s diet which was full of high protein food such as chicken and eggs, Wales Online reports. But now, she eats a diet that’s higher in fat. Today, the 5ft 11in fitness blogger weighs a healthy 12st and works out six days a week. In just over a year, she lost 170 pounds – or 5st 3lb. She shares her progress on Instagram, YouTube and her fitness blog, Mari Easy Fitness, and has attracted tens of thousands of followers. Mari said: “It all started when I was in my final year of university. “I struggled with depression and anxiety and I ended up having to drop out and move back home for a bit. That’s when I started to eat lots of pizzas and unhealthy food.  “I decided to make small changes, like eating cleaner food and my boyfriend was really into bodybuilding, so I started to get into the gym. “I went from hating the gym to loving it. Seeing my body change motivated me more.” She added: I taught myself a lot about the gym. I was doing a lot of the same exercises as my boyfriend but then I learnt how to do things that I wanted to do like tone my butt.” Mari, who recently completed her degree in fashion and retail in Philadelphia, has also released fitness programmes called Fit with Mari and a resistance band which sold out online. “It’s something I love doing and I’m doing it full time at the moment,” she continued.  “People think being a social media influencer is easy and all you have to do is post a few photos, but it’s hard work. “I’ve also used some of the things I learnt [at university] which I didn’t think I would do. I had to work on the sizes and the designs and work with prototypes.” Mari puts part of her social media success down to being an ordinary woman who has worked hard for her body. “When you go on Instagram, it can be scary because it’s just full of beautiful women,” she said. “But I think more people can relate to me because I did use to be overweight.

The student, 21, was in hospital alone and needed to have an IV drip put in.  Jordyn is afraid of needles – as many are – so was feeling a little down about the procedure. Thankfully, an imaginative nurse helped her through it.   Jordyn shared the nurse\u0027s offbeat, but effective tactics on Twitter:            We thought what the nurse did was pretty great and asked Jordyn a little bit more about it.  The childcare student comes from West Virginia, US, and has suffered a few health problems lately: I was admitted in the middle of the night with a kidney infection. My parents were out of town and I couldn’t get a hold of any of my friends. his time last year I had a lot of medical issues going on, so I’m pretty used to being in the hospital by myself. But I also know I have tricky veins – they\u0027re small and aren\u0027t easily got to. I was just really nervous and got anxious and lightheaded.  Jordyn said she knew the nurse knew what she was doing and that she could trust her, but was still really struggling with the IV. The student told the Mirror: [She] told me that it would be a really quick process and that she’s good at what she does, and I said \u0027thank you, I just need to distract myself\u0027. She instantly whipped out her phone and was like, \u0027here, I’ll help distract you\u0027... and she pulled up her Tinder and said, \u0027you’re a pretty girl, I know you have some great taste in men, go through these fools and tell me which ones I should message back\u0027.  It was funny. As she was doing the IV I was going through her Tinder and would point out one said I thought were good looking or nice guys and we would laugh and talk about it, and the next thing you know she was done.  Jordyn said she\u0027s had to spent a lot of time in hospital and been cared for by lots of medical professionals – but this technique was a first.

We were like ‘what’s going on here?’ “I thought it was a bit dangerous because it could have been a choking hazard. “It even looks like it could be something from outer space, a bit of meteorite or something.”  Hinay was home for the Easter holidays and was innocently pouring out his favourite breakfast food when the massive chunk appeared out of nowhere.  It was as big as half the size of the cereal box, which his family bought from Morrisons for \u0026pound2.68.

Claire Nelson, from Auckland, was preparing for death as she was stranded in the desert and thought \u0027nobody\u0027s going to know I\u0027m missing\u0027. The 35-year-old\u0027s tale of survival has stunned rescuers and medical staff with the hiker using her sunscreen bottle cap to collect her own urine to drink. Maggie Hickton said rescue personnel discovered her badly injured daughter hurt in a dried-out creek on Friday.  She\u0027s actually in good spirits but she\u0027s still in shock, Maggie told the Herald on Sunday. It was three nights in the desert with a broken pelvis. She\u0027s gone through all those thoughts about thinking she\u0027s going to die.  Claire was hiking in the Joshua Tree National Park in California when she slipped and fell, reports the New Zealand Herald .  She lay for three days unable to move, exposed to the sun and with only a t-shirt and shorts for cover. The hiker desperately tried to move the pieces of clothing around her for shelter from the scorching sun. The 35-year-old was due to meet with a friend on Thursday and had hoped when she didn\u0027t show rescuers would be sent to search for her.  Claire was left thinking, nobody knows where I am, nobody\u0027s going to know I\u0027m missing but she needed to hang on until Thursday and hope someone would save her, Maggie said. When no one came searching on Thursday she really felt she was going to die. She couldn\u0027t move and the sun was fierce. At night she was petrified of the rattlesnakes and other things. Nelson used the cap of her sunscreen bottle to collect her urine to drink. Maggie first started getting worried when she hadn\u0027t heard from Claire or seen her post on social media for a while.

The woman has not yet had a relationship , but doesn\u0027t worry that she\u0027s not worth liking and doesn\u0027t pity herself - despite the reactions of others.  In an article for an Australian website, she describes how someone once greeted her at a social event with the words: Oh, it\u0027s The Virgin!. On other occasions, she says she has been told she must be too picky - an infuriating comment typically made by people who don\u0027t know her.  The woman, who has remained anonymous, shared how it feels to have no sexual experience at an age when most people do on MamaMia .   I don’t feel shame because I don’t think there is something inherently ‘wrong’ with being a virgin or with me, she writes in the article. I don’t worry that I’m not worth liking, she adds. In contrast, she says there are many people with sexual experience who should feel shame - such as those who have cheated on or lied to a partner. The woman goes on to question how she came to be in such a situation. It wasn’t a conscious decision. I, like many people, definitely want to find a person to love and respect who will reciprocate that, she says. She describes how although she has been attracted to others on many occasions, she has found some of them to be already in relationships.

Among the unusual never-before-seen species shown in video footage is a \u0027ratfish\u0027 which has big ears and - despite having eyes - is blind, said to use a lateral line to sense the change of current. Later in the clip, a group of bright red deep sea shrimps move together across the illuminated and baited drone area and a cutthroat eel attempts to rip the meat away. The species live in seamounts - ridges caused by underwater \u0027mountains\u0027 - as deep down as 5,000 metres below the ocean\u0027s surface in dark and cold climates.

It’s definitely significant.“It’s across the whole ward. I’ve also had reports from the Charleston and Wellbank areas.”Mr Malone added: “There’s nothing to suggest at the moment that it’s anything to do with cleanliness.“I raised concerns about vermin when the new bins were rolled out last year.“Council officers are aware of it and they’re going up to take a look and see if they can find out what’s causing it.“Hopefully other councillors will keep a close eye on their wards to stop any further outbreak.”Brian Baird, operations manager for Eliminate – a pest control service which works in Dundee – said the most likely cause of the infestations was the rats having a plentiful food source.He said: “The usual reasons for them being in an area would be a food source – obviously around places such as takeaways that deal with food a lot or if there was somewhere else that food had been left.“The best thing to do to try to prevent rats is just general housekeeping – being vigilant.”Mr Baird also warned people not to ignore signs of rats because there are a number of illnesses that can be passed on to humans through the rodents’ urine or faeces, notably Weil’s disease.Weil’s disease is a form of a bacterial infection also known as leptospirosis that is carried by animals, most commonly rats and cattle.A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “Pest control officers have attended the site and will revisit later today for further investigation and action where necessary.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1f489e53b-478x564.jpg ","title":"clarks goals can leave dundee united in good nick ex teammate believes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHis allegiances these days lie on the other side of the street but Bobby Mann looked on with approving interest as Dundee United fixed up lower division scoring machine Nicky Clark last week.As well the fact he’d like to see his home city back with two Premiership clubs, the former Dundee defender’s attention was sparked by the fact he’s a former team-mate of the new Tangerines striker.And he believes he’s exactly the type Csaba Laszlo needs to get United to the top flight.After leaving Dens Park in 2007, Bobby joined Peterhead and it was during his time at Balmoor his and Clark’s paths crossed.He’s quick to point out, though, back then the there was little indication the teenager he first saw in action would go on to get the goals he has.“I remember him coming to Peterhead, on loan from Aberdeen and then being signed up when he was released by them,” he said.“With us he wasn’t a striker but operated in midfield. He was obviously an attacking player and I think he scored a few goals but he never played right up front.“That might have been because he was young and, when he first arrived, Aberdeen just wanted him getting games. Because we had Martin Bavidge as the main striker, he wasn’t going to get in the team right up top.“Saying that, I’m pretty sure Nicky regarded himself as a midfielder back then and I don’t think there was any thought of moving him forward.”After two seasons and eight goals, Clark moved on from the Blue Toon to Queen of the South in 2011 and, in terms of goals, has never looked back.Whether it was having former Rangers and Hearts front man Sandy as his father, or the foresight of someone at Palmerston, Bobby acknowledged the decision to make him into a striker was a masterstroke.“His dad has obviously had an influence on his career and he might have pushed for him to go up front, or maybe it was just something someone else saw in him that made them think they should give it a try. Either way, it was a great move for him and a player that gets the goals he does is probably just what United need right now.”The fact Clark is a player who knows the Championship well, having played there for Queens, Rangers and now Dunfermline, is a big plus.United now have a few members of their squad who are used to the rigours of the second tier and, for Bobby, that’s the way to go.“When I played in the lower divisions, the teams who were successful were usually ones who had players who knew the league.“United have brought in Nicky and, assuming he’s back fit for next season, they’ll have James Keatings just behind the main striker.“I thought he was a very good signing when he joined up last summer but the season was ruined by injuries. If he’s back, though, you are talking about a player who’s got goals at that level for quite a few clubs now.“These are the type you want – once you go up you worry about a team for the league above.“If you build a team for the league you’re in and get out of it, you find a few of the boys you did bring in are capable of doing well at a higher level.“Some won’t be and will have to be replaced but you are always going to want to freshen the squad each year.“With Nicky, only time will tell how he does if United get back to the Premiership, but he’s a proven scorer in the Championship and, right now, that’s the most important thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1e2cc7499.jpg ","title":"dundee council calls last orders on pub after revoking its licence","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee licensing chiefs have called last orders on a Hilltown pub after revoking its licence to trade.Boyds Bar closed its doors suddenly earlier this month, having been trading at the Rosebank Street premises for nearly a year.A spokeswoman for Dundee City Council confirmed that the licence for the venue had been revoked as there was no designated manager at the premises.The pub has gone through as many as four owners in recent years.Previously called McAdams Bar, it was rebranded Boyds Bar earlier this year.Events including a medium night had been held at the pub as recently as last month.One former patron claimed the pub had “barrels” of potential, saying: “I’m aware that the premises have changed hands a number of times in recent years.“It was called Boyds Bar for a number of years before it was changed to McAdams and rebranded Boyds Bar.“It’s always sad to see a pub close but I was aware it had been struggling to make a go of it.“Given the right management it still has barrels of potential to be a great local for residents.”The closure comes amid tough trading conditions for Hilltown pubs after The High Corner on neighbouring Kinghorne Road failed to attract new suitors following its closure last year.Janet Hood, who runs Janet Hood Consulting and represents publicans in licensing cases, said any change to a designated manager within a public house would require the owner of the business to notify the licensing board within seven days.She said: “Not knowing the full circumstances of this particular case, it is hard to ascertain what exactly has happened.“You have to have a designated manager – that is the law.“There could be a number of reasons to change the designated manager, whether the person is sacked, loses their personal licence or passes away.“As long as you notify the licensing board within seven days you have six weeks to replace the person or you are no longer allowed to trade.“I tell all my clients for all intents and purposes to have two personal licence holders at all times.

I think you know what happens there!I have been inspired by lots of different people including Pamela Butchart, Roald Dahl, my brother Conor, who is 10, David Walliams and my classmates.My dad always shows me comics and tells me all about the Marvel Universe. I love these films.Even though I am only writing small stories, the good thing is that I’m learning all the time.Even great authors make mistakes and all you have to do is fix them.When I am older and have written some books, I hope you will read one of them.I had a great time telling you all about my love of writing.Thank you for reading my column.

I am very impressed by your penguin designs and delighted to hear that they were inspired by watching Blue Planet II. How fabulous that they were chosen for the sculptures and for such a worthy cause.“Congratulations and thank you for writing to let me know. With best wishes, David Attenborough.”Rebecca, who is a massive fan of Sir David’s nature programmes, said, “I was very excited to receive the letter as I didn’t expect a reply.“I felt honoured as I know he’s very busy. It was very nice of him to take the time to read my letter and respond.”Rebecca said that after watching Blue Planet II she wanted to raise awareness about plastic polluting the world’s oceans and she hopes her design will show the “good side and the bad side” of the sea.“I hope people who come to see the High School penguin like the design but can also take away a deeper message,” she added.Rebecca’s winning design is being painted on to the blank sculpture by F6 pupils Morven Wright, Joanna Brunton and Lily Bircham . After being given its make-over, the statue will then join 79 others on display on the streets of Dundee and beyond from June 29th in the Penguin Parade, a charity public art event that aims to raise enough money to fund the Maggie’s Centre Dundee for a year.And the entire High School community is getting behind the campaign. In addition to the design contest, the School has also already staged a Bingo Night and held a Penguin Day in the Junior Years and Nursery, with more fundraising events to come.The school’s Charities and Community Outreach Co-ordinator, Karlene Douglas, said, “Rebecca’s entry was chosen as the winning design for our penguin sculpture because it is both visually stunning and incorporates an important environmental message about our planet.“David Attenborough’s documentary series was a crucial inspiration to Rebecca’s design and so as a school we were delighted when he responded to Rebecca’s letter, congratulating her on winning the competition.“We are proud to support the Maggie’s Penguin Parade and look forward to seeing our finished sculpture outside the school gates.”Maggie’s Centres provide free practical, social and emotional support for people with cancer and their families and friends.

Part of that is down to us expanding all the time, and always having new beneficiaries coming on board, but it’s still a staggering amount.“We supply to all sorts of third-sector organisations — a lot of the hostels, for example.

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0bcbdf26fb0-846x564.jpg ","title":"revealed majority of dundee fans back dens park name change","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe majority of Dundee FC fans would back a move to introduce a sponsor’s name to their Dens Park stadium.An exclusive poll for the Evening  showed that nearly 59% of supporters are keen on the idea of gaining extra income by changing the name of their historic home.We revealed last week that Kilmac could be incorporated into the Dens Park name from next season.More than 300 people took part in our survey, with 186 voting yes to the question: “Would you welcome sponsorship of Dens Park to secure more income for Dundee FC?”Responding to the poll, Steve Barham from Stobswell wrote: “Any income to the club would be fantastic.“Regardless of any name change, it would still be Dens to many fans.“Other clubs have their stadiums sponsored nowadays.

name.Another fan cautioned the club against inviting any food-related sponsors, saying: “As long as it doesn’t sound as bad as the Tony Macaroni Arena (in Livingston) we might live with it.”Graham Pert, from Whitfield, added: “I’m all up for things that will be great for the club but at this stage I think it would be sad to see the name changed from Dens Park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

I find NHS finance statements to be completely opaque.\"We need something much clearer based upon what we need to know each month.\"The council is to write to the health board about the issue.A report to councillors by Bill Alexander, the council\u0027 director care and learning, pointed to poor links between \"financial challenges and service planning processes, particularly regarding adult social care\".He said one of the key motivations behind integrating services had been \"the recognition that the resources of both organisations would become increasingly constrained,\" and that \"major change\" was now required to the way services are planned and delivered.Speaking after the debate, Councillor Davidson said: \"It can improve a lot.

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million). There\u0027 little that can be done to increase revenue from learning, which relies on Scottish Government grants. But there\u0027 a big need to increase revenue for the care budget, particularly as the local population is ageing and many more people need care.\"Wednesday 30 May 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04101000/04101605.jpg","title":"New community cafe for Merkinch","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW caf\u0026eacute in the heart of an Inverness community is aiming to become a much-needed social hub for the area\u0027 residents.The Coffee House has opened in the Bike Shed in Merkinch in a joint partnership involving the Methodist Church and King\u0027 Fellowship which runs a successful coffee shop in a converted fish processing factory in the Smithton Industrial Estate.The facility, in Grant Street, will open initially Wednesdays to Fridays between 10am and 3pm serving barista-made coffees at affordable prices but the aim is to extend to a fourth day and also to open in the evenings.Chris Dowling, pastor of King\u0027 Fellowship, said surveys had revealed residents felt the area desperately needed a caf\u0026eacute.\"We hope mums will call in on their way back from dropping off the children at school, as well as others in the community who might feel lonely or isolated,\" he said.\"Part of the vision is to create the best coffee shop in the Highlands in the heart of Grant Street but also a place for the community to meet.\"Wednesday 30 May 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04102000/04102991.jpg","title":"New riverside artwork unveiled","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspArtists Sans facon and OSA unveiled their design - two curved walls on either side of the River Ness at the Little Isle Pool, Fisherman\u0027s Car park - this morning.Tristan Surtees of Sans facon said the work aimed to \"complement the river and people\u0027s relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"For more details see tomorrow\u0027s Inverness Courier.Let us know what you think of the design at newsdesk@spp-group or on\u0026nbspthe Courier\u0026nbspFacebook page.Wednesday 30 May 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04103000/04103871.jpg","title":"North Coast 500 to star in new book","story":"\u0026nbspAN award-winning Highland photographer with a dream of creating a crowdfunded book of the region has smashed his fundraising goal.John Baikie is overwhelmed by the support he has received, with more than \u0026pound6400 pledged to help him create a photographic tribute to the North Coast 500.He had to raise \u0026pound6000 in a month for the project to go ahead.\"I am absolutely delighted to get there so quickly,\" he said.\"It is great news.

He pinpointed Neale and insisted he was an “outstanding” player who could walk into any top team in Europe.Still a teenager, Neale proved that in Munich.Willie said: “I have so many happy football memories of Neale, but also so many other great memories because he was such a great guy.”Neale made his Aberdeen first team debut on October 11 1980 in a 2-0 defeat of Kilmarnock at Pittodrie.He partnered Willie at centre-back in that game because Alex McLeish was out injured at the time.Willie said: “Neale broke through very early in his career and was just a wee lad.“He always had that talent and I think he had the eye on the sweeper’s position but I had to persuade him to move into midfield.“Neale and Neil Simpson were an absolutely magnificent combination.“Neale was an Aberdeen boy brought through and developed by the club and given the big chance to shine.“And he certainly did that.”Following that debut, Neale would go on to win two league titles, four Scottish Cups and the League Cup domestically.“Tattie” would add the European Cup Winners’ Cup and Super Cup in 1983 as an integral part of the only Scottish team to win two European trophies.His first trophy success came in 1982 with a 4-1 Scottish Cup win over Rangers after extra-time.With the Reds 3-1 up at Hampden, Neale, just 18, scored an iconic goal.He smashed a shot into an open net in front of the Rangers end, before punching the air \u0026#8230 and then doing a forward roll.Neale made 220 appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 10 goals, before transferring to top flight Aston Villa in 1986.He would go on to play for Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline Athletic and Ross County.In a successful managerial career, Neale guided Ross County through two successive promotions.As manager of Hartlepool he took the side to the play-offs for the second tier.Neale would also go on to manage Gillingham and Peterhead before returning to Hartlepool in the 2011-12 season.His final trophy success with Aberdeen was the Scottish Cup in 1986 – a 3-0 win over Hearts at Hampden.Fellow midfielder Jim Bett played alongside Neale in that cup final win.Jim, speaking from his home in Iceland, said: “Neale was a great guy to have in the dressing room as he was always upbeat and telling jokes.“He was a great footballer and also a great guy.“We played together in the Aberdeen team that won the Scottish Cup in 1986.“Alex Ferguson left the following season and that was the start of the team beginning to break up.“The boys who had played under Sir Alex had won everything and perhaps needed a new challenge.“Neale went down to Aston Villa and one or two others went elsewhere.“He played for a few other clubs but his heart was always in Aberdeen.”Neale signed schoolboy forms with Aberdeen under Billy McNeill in the 1977-78 season.He was such an exciting talent Neale made his debut for the Aberdeen reserves at the age of just 14.On turning 16, Neale was secured on a full-time contract at Pittodrie by Sir Alex Ferguson.He would go on to conquer Europe before he was out of his teens.Jim said: “It was some achievement for a player to come through the youth ranks at Aberdeen and then win European trophies.“Neale won everything domestically with Aberdeen and was a key part of that side that won two European trophies.“Alex Ferguson was a manager who gave young players a chance and at that time there were a few of them coming through at Pittodrie.“That was very fortunate for Aberdeen.“Neale went on to reach the heights with Aberdeen and lift European trophies.“It was fantastic to see a young player from the city go on to have so much success.“Neale achieved so much during his career.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/10/59e5aebf3e38d-848x564.jpg ","title":"colourful mural to reflect history of popular park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA mural is set to deliver a splash of colour – and a dose of history – to a popular Aberdeen park.A new community group has been created to paint the artwork on the Gardener’s Bothy in Seaton Park and work has now started.It is being carried out in collaboration with Friends of Seaton Park and the Seaton Community Centre Art History Group.The project became a reality after the community centre received participatory budget funding from Aberdeen City Council.It is hoped the finished mural will capture scenes from the popular park, including the family favourite train attraction Mr Therm.The group meets every Monday from 1.30pm, weather permitting, to work on the bothy.Sheila Gordon, chairwoman of Friends of Seaton Park, said: “It was a suggestion that was made a long time ago, I’ve been trying to get it done for years.“There’s an artist in residence at the community centre, so he’ll be taking the classes.

There are no rules or limits to the imagination – they may want to be a wizard or superhero.If a child does not know what they want to be they can decorate their hat with something they are passionate about such as a sport, graffiti art, dancing shoes, or musical instrument.The idea behind the fun is to raise money for the UK’s leading children\u0026#8217s charity to help give thousands of disadvantaged children a better future. When they go into school, nursery or playgroup on May 18, parents and carers can make a voluntary donation of £1 to £2 to Barnardo\u0026#8217s Scotland.Children are full of surprises, and this is a fun way of allowing their imaginations to run wild in a way that will be inspiring, educational and raise money to help transform the lives of children who desperately need our support.It is easy to sign up on our website where you\u0026#8217ll find lots of resources and ideas to ensure your fundraising Hat Day will be a huge success and help support the children and young people we support in your local community.To register, visit www.barnardos.org.uk/hatday. Here you\u0026#8217ll find everything you need to make the event a success at your school, nursery or playgroup.Our resources section has school posters, sample letters for parents and hat-making guides. Contact regional relationships manager for Scotland, Jennifer Keegan on Jennifer.Keegan@Barnardos.org.uk for further information or assistance.To help with ideas, Barnardo\u0026#8217s is launching a separate \u0026#8216Top Hat\u0026#8217 competition for teachers/parents for best hat in the run up to Hat Day, with a poll to decide the winner on the Barnardo\u0026#8217s Community Fundraising facebook page.Martin Crewe, director for Barnardo\u0026#8217s ScotlandSir,I write concerning the blight of ferry disruptions across my council ward, particularity on the island of Islay.We cannot allow CalMac\u0026#8217s management blunders and lack of funding from the Scottish Government to act as a ball and chain which is holding back my local ward\u0026#8217s fast industrial growth.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the UK.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here.

That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale. The wire and cloth faceless mermaids dance on the surface of a pond but hide, too, under a running waterfall, washing the seaweed stuck to their scaled tails.Andy McClintock said: ‘I imagine water sprites dancing in the lagoon and disporting themselves in waterfalls.’Within The Mill itself, paintings are hung showing the allure of algae.Artist Lottie Goodlet said: ‘As a snorkeller and swimmer in the Sound of Jura, I am fascinated by seaweed beneath me. I see it as secret and unexpected treasure \u0026#8211 underwater kelp forests and ocean meadows gracefully riding the ebb and flow of the tides.’The influences of nature brought into a new light makes for a mysterious experience that will stay with you far longer than the trail can last.The art trail at Taynish National Nature Reserve runs until Sunday September 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll celebrates weekend of champions","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 25/05/18, 6:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNot for a decade, since the days of Inveraray\u0026#8217s young pipe band powering up the rankings has Mid Argyll seen such kilted success.But matching the achievement of new British champions Mid Argyll Pipe Band on Saturday May 19 was Lochgilphead Red Star football club, which earlier in the day clinched the league title \u0026#8211 for the first time in 30 years.Mid Argyll\u0026#8217s weekend of winners started with Red Star beating  Busby AFC to be crowned SAFL Premier 2 champions. Red Star won their only previous title \u0026#8211 SAFL Fourth Division \u0026#8211 in 1988 under manager Hughie Lindsay. There have been promotions, relegations and plenty of drama in between, but never a league crown.Red Star manager Dougie Moore said: \u0026#8216This is a major achievement for the club and for a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216We only have a small squad, but with some excellent players, many of whom have been involved with the Soccer Centre, which deserves great credit.\u0026#8216Seeing them play football with a smile and allowing them to express themselves on the pitch has been extremely pleasing and a personal highlight.\u0026#8217Led by Pipe Major Craig Lang and lead drummer Graeme MacMillan, Mid Argyll Pipe Band won the British Pipe Band Championship at Grade 4B.Craig, now in his sixth season leading the band, was \u0026#8216absolutely delighted\u0026#8217 to clinch first place among 21 competing bands.He added: \u0026#8216The band had an average age of 18 on Saturday at Paisley with four players in their first competition, one still in primary school.\u0026#8216It has taken years of hard work and a lot of that can be credited to Rod Buchanan for chanter lessons and Donald MacLachlan, our drum tutor.\u0026#8216It is also a great result for Graeme MacMillan, who returned after a five-year absence from the pipe band circuit to win a major.\u0026#8217The band celebrated in style on their return from Paisley with an impromptu performance in Lochgilphead town centre to the delight of band parents and supporters.Before heading to Tarbert on Sunday May 27 to play at the Scottish Series sailing event, Mid Argyll Pipe Band will be at the Ropework in Lochgilphead the day before to help Red Star celebrate.Star will receive the Premier 2 trophy at 3.45pm on Saturday and it is an occasion not to be missed.PICS:Mid Argyll Pipe Band members celebrates after their championship success. no_a21MAPBchamps01Pipe Major Craig Lang clutches the British championship trophy. 06_a21PipeBand08Lochgilphead Red Star AFC, league champions. 06_a18RedStar_TeamPhoto_home01\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Council chiefs shut a popular seafront tower amid safety fears in March. Now they have warned that the unit, enjoyed annually by thousands, will lie dormant until “later this year”. The multi-play tower is awaiting a \u0026pound260,000 overhaul after “a number of health and safety risks” were uncovered. Other equipment is still in use, but the giant climbing frame which anchors the park remains roped off. The lack of progress on a replacement has led to discontent among parents and political figures. Ayr west councillor, Martin Dowey, said: “As a tourist town, getting this replaced should have been high priority.  “Thousands of families will come to our beach over the summer and be left disappointed. “It is sadly indicative of a lack of progress from the council on many issues at the seafront.” Councillors signed off \u0026pound260,000 in their March budget to fund a replacement for the old play tower, which lasted 23 years. A council spokesman said: “The seafront play park remains open with funds agreed for a new play tower following the budget decision in March. “We are set to dismantle the old equipment in the next few weeks. “The new tower will be made to order and we expect it to be delivered later this year, it will then take a few weeks to install.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr roundabout named among uks","story":"NewsAyr roundabout named among UK\u0027s worstWhitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:14, 28 MAY 2018NewsWhitletts roundabout is one of the most dangerous in the UK (Image: IAIN BROWN)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA roundabout branded ‘Witless’ for striking fear into drivers has been named among the UK’s worst. Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

Ambassador Bowling Club president Anne Gibson said South Ayrshire Council’s new money spinner will stop some elderly members from getting out of the house. Ms Gibson said the Prestwick club is a social lifeline for older people including widowed folk. And during the cold, dark winter months it is somewhere safe to go to keep elderly people active. Finance bosses at the council want drivers to pay at Bellevue Road car park near the club and swimming pool. It is believed the move, which will roll out in other towns, will coin in \u0026pound120,000.  Anne said: “Our club is a social hub for elderly members. Eighty per cent of our members are aged over 73. They already pay because it is a private club. “We worry the car parking charge on top of that wil mean they can no longer afford it. There is a real threat the club may close or the parking charges will drive down membership numbers.” It is estimated the new fees will add \u0026pound3 to every game played. Anne continued: “South Ayrshire Council are supposed to encourage sport and leisure. This car park is used for the bowling club and the swimming pool. This should be a special case.” Describing individual member experiences, Anne said: “One of the men said he is recently widowed. He was depressed in the winter and said the bowling club was a Godsend to combat loneliness.  “His story is echoed by lots of people. Members have said if the club closed they don’t know what they would do. One lady had a fall and the doctor advised exercise like bowling, which is essential for health. They don’t like going out walking on their own. We offer a warm and friendly environment.” Coaching and rink space for blind bowlers is also provided. And young junior members are being coached to an international standard. She added: “Parking at a distance could prove hazardous for older members in icy or slippy conditions but that may be their only option if charges are introduced.” The club are collecting signatures for a petition.

South Ayrshire officials are to spend the summer soul searching in a bid to find a plan B for their Riverside project. And it could be the end of the year before the scheme is dragged back on track. It comes as new figures showed \u0026pound527,000 has already been blown – without a brick being laid. A “workstream to explore the options” was this week set to be approved, following rejection of a new \u0026pound11million office block. But a report on where to go next will not come before councillors until August at the earliest – after they return from their summer holiday.  Critics labelled the timetable “an insult” as the project threatens to plunge into crisis. Norman McLean, chair of Fort, Seafield and Wallacetown Community Council, said: “This is totally unacceptable. “What we need now is to fast track ideas and utilise the talents of those who can help. “Some ideas are simple and some are more complex, but we need urgent progress.” A “limited competition” open to a handful of “innovative design companies” is among the options favoured by Mr McLean. He added: “At this rate, we will be in December stuck in exactly the same position.” Conservative opposition leader, Councillor Martin Dowey, said: “We are sleepwalking our way into a disaster and nobody at the top seems willing to accept reality.  “Any suggestion that this can be kicked into the long grass is an insult. “It seems a case of crossing our fingers and hoping for a magic cure. “The sooner the council wakes up to what’s happening here, the better.” The Ayrshire Post contacted South Ayrshire Council last week for a statement on the \u0026pound527,000 spent thus far on the Riverside project. A council spokesman said: The expenditure is in line with expected costs for a project of this size and includes design team, project management and advisor fees, surveys and statutory consent.

Ayr’s historic Tam O’Shanter Inn will invest up to \u0026pound80,000 in the al fresco patio to the rear of its property. The boozer, run by David and Mareena Cowan, had gained council planning permission last month. But environmental health bosses this week said a “high chance of noise issues” was causing concern. “It would be remiss of us not to make an objection on these grounds,” they added. Pub boss David, addressing South Ayrshire’s licensing board, said: “We totally understand the concerns.  “But there will be no music played and this is purely and simply about serving teas, coffees and beer until the 10pm curfew.” David said the beer garden would, in the short term, be self-contained at the back of the Inn, which first opened in 1749. A longer term plan to gain access from the rear of the bar/restaurant would then be put in place. He added: “We see this as a good chance to generate extra employment for around five or six people. “The investment will run to between \u0026pound70,000 and \u0026pound80,000 – and not many people are investing in Ayr town centre at the moment.” David confirmed that six CCTV cameras would be installed to monitor the beer garden for security.  He said: “We envisage it being a safer environment than at present, as there can be quite a few issues there. “Perhaps this will encourage any undesirables to go elsewhere.” A limited range of draft beers, wines and spirits will be available at the bar, said David with all other alcohol served inside the traditional pub. Licensing board member, council leader Douglas Campbell, said: “It is welcome investment for the town centre and I’m sure it will be properly supervised.” The decision to approve the license was approved unanimously.

A shiny, newly constructed bus terminal would be half a mile across town to Burns Statue Square. And the historic train station would be prised apart from the Station Hotel and rebuilt as a modern standalone hub. The dramatic vision, which is only one of the options being considered, would also see a chunk of the hotel knocked down and the remainder converted to homes. The multi-million pound makeover of the town’s transport infrastructure depends on businesses such as Stagecoach and ScotRail buying into the idea. Parkhouse Street, which is home to a number of high-profile estate agents, would be pedestrianised in one option.  And the dual carriageway A70 leading from the Market Inn roundabout into the town could become single lane in either direction. Folk had the chance to see the ideas from Ayr Renaissance at a public exhibition in the Town Hall last week. Ayr Renaissance chair James Knox said: “We want to give everyone the chance to have their say on the masterplan for Burns Statue Square. “Nothing is written in stone. We have just begun the consultation process.” A council spokesman said: “We’re at the start of a process looking at options to regenerate Burns Statue Square and the Affleck’s block site, one of Ayr’s hidden gems behind the town hall. Some initial options were pulled together for the consultation last week, however we’re keen to hear more ideas from the public, so we’re looking at additional exhibitions in the near future.”  Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “This is a good opportunity to get on and regenerate Ayr town centre, which is badly needed. There are multiple issues that need to be addressed and we need all stakeholders to put the interests of Ayr first and foremost. “These are ideas that we can work with and shape to make Ayr better. But these improvements will only happen if we all pull together.” Consultants Ironside Farrar have been working on designs. Concerns have been mounting over the future of Ayr’s railway presence as the state of the Station Hotel continues to deteriorate.  The hotel owners have been told to carry out essential maintenance by the council and were slapped with a dangerous building notice. There are still question marks over the future of the Odeon amid speculation it could move to another location in the town. Office building Burns House has been labelled as not fit for purpose and is due to be demolished. But the new replacement building plans for the bottom of the town have been knocked back – throwing the office relocation timescale off. The timeline and budget for the Burns Statue Square makeover has not been released. Stagecoach and Network Rail did not reply to Ayrshire Post requests for comment before our deadline.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

Chairman of the club Peter Mason said: “I am very proud that we now have over 100 members. “In the two years since the group started many things have happened, many new friendships have been formed and many new skills learned. “These groups are going from strength to strength, and I would like to thank the group leaders for all the hard work they put into their groups week on week and also to the members who come along to support each group.” The group meet on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis, mostly at The Speakers, 8-10 Whitehall, on Maybole High Street.  From health and fitness classes like yoga and keep fit, sewing and a Knit and Natter class and even the opportunity to learn a new language with Spanish and German classes – there’s lots to do and new skills to achieve. Chairman Peter hopes more clubs can be formed to cater for even more members. He added: “For the future I hope to see some more new groups starting especially for male members as I am conscious that we do not have a lot to offer to them. “If we can retain our successes for another year, we will go from strength to strength and I hope each and every one of you will join me on that journey.” ● For more information of what activities are on offer, visit the website at www.mayboleover50s.org or contact club secretary Anne Walker on 07846 180753.

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12611218.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PCP_SDR_SCOTRAIL018JPG.jpg","title":"troon beach revellers face travel","story":"NewsTroon beach revellers face travel chaos as ScotRail services to Glasgow Central hit by signalling faultScotRail has announced that a signalling fault is causing cancellations and delays to its services between Ayr and Glasgow.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson14:48, 28 MAY 2018Updated16:23, 28 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of boozed-up teens face being stranded in Troon this afternoon after train services to Glasgow went down.

car","story":"A DOG groomer from Galashiels has been forced to cut out her car after a blackbird set up home on one of the wheels.\nJoni Fairburn discovered a nest on top of one of the tyres of her Volkswagen Tiguan last week.\nAnd inside were three eggs.\nThe vehicle had been parked outside Joni\u0027s Abbotsview Drive home for five days after being serviced.\nAnd the blackbird, dubbed Bonnie by Joni\u0027s children, took full advantage by not only building her nest but also laying three eggs.\nMum-of-two Joni, who runs her dog grooming business from home, explained: \"The car had been in for a service on the Friday and we decided to give it a rest for a few days as it had been clocking up a lot of miles.\n\"Unknown to us Bonnie took advantage of the situation to build a nest on the rear tyre of the car.\n\"It was pure chance on the following Wednesday that I spotted it before driving the car again.\n\"I noticed a lot of debris at the foot of the wheel and lifted the nest not realising what it was.\n\"But when I saw the eggs I put it straight back as I was worried Bonnie would just abandon it if it was moved.\"\nJoni contacted the RSPB for advice.\nBut was told that moving the nest would inevitably be the end of Bonnie\u0027s eggs.\nShe added: \"I spoke to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and they said if I needed the car I should contact the council who would remove the nest but the eggs would be destroyed so I was not having that.\n\"Bonnie seems very contented and oblivious to the fuss but it has been a major talking point amongst the neighbours and the kids pop out from time to time to have a chat with her and make sure she is okay.\n\"Fortunately I work from home so not reliant on the car, so it\u0027s the bike for me for the next few weeks.\n\"On the plus side I have got a Tough Mudder assault course coming up so I can use the break from driving to get plenty of training in.\"\nJoni will be without her car for around a month as the two-week incubation period will be followed by a period of another two weeks before the chicks will fledge.\nAnd in some cases the parents may decide to do it all again with a second brood.\nBonnie\u0027s tyre residence is just the latest in a long line of bizarre nesting spots.\nAs the nesting season takes off, birds are setting up homes in hanging baskets, tool boxes or even washing on clothes lines.\nThe Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said nests have been found in post boxes, rubbish bins, clothes-peg bags and even the pockets of jeans left hanging on the line too long.\nHanging baskets are a particular favourite with wrens, while many birds make use of garden ornaments or buckets.\nBlackbirds have been found on nesting on car wheels, blue tits have set up home in communal ashtrays and mistle thrushes have nested on a set of traffic lights.\nIntentionally damaging nests is a criminal offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, and can lead to adult birds abandoning the site.\nIf chicks are still in the nest when it is abandoned by their parents, they are likely to starve, the charity warned.\nRichard James, wildlife adviser for the RSPB, said: \"Most people would be horrified if they disturbed a nest, so we\u0027re urging everyone to be mindful at this time of year.\n\"Bear in mind that any nook or cranny could be a nest site \u0026ndash they may not be obvious but you\u0027d be surprised what creative housebuilders garden birds can be.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Roxburgh air cadet  19  named best in country","story":"A ROXBURGH air

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it.
