But before the rider left, he asked something they probably weren’t expecting: “Can I take your picture?”Venturi, 39, began studying photography 11 years ago, and has since documented sport, theatre events and social phenomena. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, he has been photographing delivery riders. Speaking down the phone from his home, where he, his partner and their son have been quarantined for two weeks, he tells me how he started to worry about the riders, coming into contact with stranger after stranger, while providing an essential service to those who can afford to self-isolate. As he started ordering more deliveries, he asked each rider – from a safe distance – about their lives under coronavirus.Most told him they weren’t worried, because they take precautions, as do customers. But 23-year-old Andrea, delivering sushi, wasn’t so sure. “I’m not calm,” he told Venturi. “Even if I take all the precautions, people tend to touch you, to take risks – they assume neither of you are infected. But I could be, or they could be. How do I know that they’re not in quarantine?”Venturi tells me he was struck by both the lack of consideration given to riders’ health, and their lack of choice when it came to doing the job. Davide, 25, was laid off when the restaurant he worked for closed down his second job as a personal trainer has also been terminated. Delivering burgers to make ends meet, Davide hasn’t been given a mask or gloves. “If they want them, they have to buy them themselves,” Venturi says. “Before the crisis, they cost one or two euros each – now they cost €20 or €30. And it’s not as if they can wear them for days and days.”Naturally, the lockdown made some interviews difficult. While most people were happy to talk, Venturi says, a driver called Antonio would only tell him, “I work in black.” Why? “I think it was his way of explaining that he couldn’t tell me anything else. The police roam the streets, making sure anyone who is out has a valid reason. I think he was worried that being photographed and interviewed wasn’t a good enough reason.” Delivery riders have witnessed the multiple ways people deal with their anxieties about contagion.Simone, 32, brought Venturi breakfast from a nearby coffee bar. The venue had always delivered pizza in the evening, but expanded their hours to deliver from 9am to 10pm. He reported that one customer laid out kitchen towels on the floor outside the door, and asked him to place the bag on top. “Perhaps that’s a little excessive,” Venturi says, “but taking it from his hand would mean standing closer than a metre.” Simone wears a mask and always keeps a metre away from a customer, so he’s not very worried. His main fear is that the situation could get worse. “I fear that the government might also consider stopping home deliveries,” he says.An unexpected upside was shared by 19-year-old Lucian. Generally, people do not tip in Italy now, in an effort to avoid touching notes and coins, customers are telling him to keep the change.“So he’s making more money, and that’s better for him, but the reason is sad,” Venturi says. “They’re not being generous – they’re afraid of him.”At the time of writing, the mortality rate for Covid-19 in Italy is the highest in the world, in part because the population is older. But Venturi is concerned that many younger people don’t seem to grasp that they, too, are potentially at risk.Alessandro, 21, told Venturi: “I’m calm when I work. I’m more worried about my band. We have an album coming out and we’re supposed to do a European tour in the late summer. I worry that everything will be cancelled.”The photographer says a lot of older people are frustratingly complacent, too: “They often think they’re safe if they don’t have cardiac or respiratory problems.”Though the job lacks the hero status afforded health workers and firefighters, Venturi points out that delivery riders have also risked their health so that others can stay safe and fed. Their lives might be tough or precarious in normal circumstances currently, they are even more so. “They bring food to people who are staying safe in their homes, but that puts them at greater risk. And they in turn risk taking it home and passing it on to family.” Why shouldn’t they keep the change?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2716b33f1ac8ef76665f02a69507d3898bbe8267/699_128_2432_1459/master/2432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3349ab3297a1a728eb5d3848f5b548bc","title":"sports direct mike ashley apologises for poor covid 19 actions","story":"After trying to keep shops open, boss says emails to government were ill-judged and poorly timedMike Ashley has issued a public apology after his spat with the government about trying to keep his Sports Direct chain open when non-essential businesses were ordered to close.Ashley’s Frasers Group, which includes House of Fraser and Evans Cycles, had intended to keep Sports Direct open as other non-essential retailers closed, on the basis that selling sporting and fitness equipment made the company a vital asset as Britons were forced to stay at home.He eventually bowed to government pressure and shut his stores on Tuesday but is continuing to operate online via the group’s Derbyshire warehouse, where the company has admitted it is struggling to enforce the government’s Covid-19 regulations for thousands of workers. People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.“I am deeply apologetic about the misunderstandings of the last few days,” Ashley said in an open letter. “Given what has taken place over the last few days, I thought it was necessary to address and apologise for much of what has been reported across various media outlets regarding my personal actions and those of the Frasers Group business.”In its attempt to stay open, the company went as far as lobbying Boris Johnson directly with a public tweet after the prime minister on Monday ordered that all non-essential stores should close.Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday that Sports Direct had made the wrong call and that its stores should not be open. Its management had “got the message”, Gove added, after Sports Direct agreed to close stores.Ashley said on Friday: “Our intentions were only to seek clarity from the government as to whether we should keep some of our stores open. We would never have acted against their advice. In hindsight, our emails to the government were ill-judged and poorly timed, when they clearly had much greater pressures than ours to deal with. On top of this our communications to our employees and the public on this was poor.”Ashley said the company had since sought to make amends by offering its entire fleet of lorries to help deliver medical equipment and supplies for the NHS and all key workforces across government. “We will help wherever possible,” he said.Ashley also praised his workers, some of whom were made to come in on Tuesday for tasks such as stocktaking.“I would especially like to thank my Frasers Group employees, who have stood by the business in difficult times and are doing so currently,” he said. “We are working very hard to save our business. We will learn from this and will try not to make the same mistakes in the future.”The government subsequently added bike shops to the list of essential businesses that can stay open. Ashley’s Evans Cycles is considering reopening its doors as a result."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be350730e6e74bc124aef4aa454c808393df1383/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52cca933f28dfdc433f7150aff5c6041","title":"coronavirus politics lockdown hobbes","story":"In a lockdown, we can see the essence of politics is still what Hobbes described: some people get to tell others what to doWe keep hearing that this is a war. Is it really? What helps to give the current crisis its wartime feel is the apparent absence of normal political argument. The prime minister goes on TV to issue a sombre statement to the nation about the curtailment of our liberties and the leader of the opposition offers nothing but support. Parliament, insofar as it is able to operate at all, appears to be merely going through the motions. People are stuck at home, and their fights are limited to the domestic sphere. There is talk of a government of national unity. Politics-as-usual has gone missing.But this is not the suspension of politics. It is the stripping away of one layer of political life to reveal something more raw underneath. In a democracy we tend to think of politics as a contest between different parties for our support. We focus on the who and the what of political life: who is after our votes, what they are offering us, who stands to benefit. We see elections as the way to settle these arguments. But the bigger questions in any democracy are always about the how: how will governments exercise the extraordinary powers we give them? And how will we respond when they do?These are the questions that have always preoccupied political theorists. But now they are not so theoretical. As the current crisis shows, the primary fact that underpins political existence is that some people get to tell others what to do. At the heart of all modern politics is a trade-off between personal liberty and collective choice. This is the Faustian bargain identified by the philosopher Thomas Hobbes in the middle of the 17th century, when the country was being torn apart by a real civil war.As Hobbes knew, to exercise political rule is to have the power of life and death over citizens. The only reason we would possibly give anyone that power is because we believe it is the price we pay for our collective safety. But it also means that we are entrusting life-and-death decisions to people we cannot ultimately control.The primary risk is that those on the receiving end refuse to do what they are told. At that point, there are only two choices. Either people are forced to obey, using the coercive powers the state has at its disposal. Or politics breaks down altogether, which Hobbes argued was the outcome we should fear most of all.In a democracy, we have the luxury of waiting for the next election to punish political leaders for their mistakes. But that is scant consolation when matters of basic survival are at stake. Anyway, it’s not much of a punishment, relatively speaking. They might lose their jobs, though few politicians wind up destitute. We might lose our lives.The rawness of these choices is usually obscured by the democratic imperative to seek consensus. That has not gone away. The government is doing all it can to dress up its decisions in the language of commonsense advice. It says it is still trusting iniduals to show sound judgment. But as the experience of other European countries shows, as the crisis deepens the stark realities become clearer. Just watch the footage of Italian mayors screaming at their constituents to stay at home. “Vote for me or the other lot get in” is routine democratic politics. “Do this or else” is raw democratic politics. At that point it doesn’t look so different from politics of any other kind.This crisis has revealed some other hard truths. National governments really matter, and it really matters which one you happen to find yourself under. Though the pandemic is a global phenomenon, and is being experienced similarly in many different places, the impact of the disease is greatly shaped by decisions taken by inidual governments. Different views about when to act and how far to go still mean that no two nations are having the same experience. At the end of it all we may get to see who was right and what was wrong. But for now, we are at the mercy of our national leaders. That is something else Hobbes warned about: there is no avoiding the element of arbitrariness at the heart of all politics. It is the arbitrariness of inidual political judgment.Under a lockdown, democracies reveal what they have in common with other political regimes: here too politics is ultimately about power and order. But we are also getting to see some of the fundamental differences. It is not that democracies are nicer, kinder, gentler places. They may try to be, but in the end that doesn’t last. Democracies do, though, find it harder to make the really tough choices. Pre-emption – the ability to tackle a problem before it becomes acute – has never been a democratic strength. We wait until we have no choice and then we adapt. That means democracies are always going to start off behind the curve of a disease like this one, though some are better at playing catch-up than others.Autocratic regimes such as China also find it hard to face up to crises until they have to – and, unlike democracies, they can suppress the bad news for longer if it suits them. But when action becomes unavoidable, they can go further. The Chinese lockdown succeeded in containing the disease through ruthless pre-emption. Democracies are capable of being equally ruthless – as they showed when prosecuting the total wars of the 20th century.But in a war, the enemy is right in front of you. During this pandemic the disease reveals where it has got to only in the daily litany of infections and deaths. Democratic politics becomes a kind of shadow boxing: the state doesn’t know which bodies are the really dangerous ones.Some democracies have managed to adapt faster: in South Korea the disease is being tamed by extensive tracing and widespread surveillance of possible carriers. But in that case, the regime had recent experience to draw on in its handling of the Mers outbreak of 2015, which also shaped the collective memory of its citizens. Israel may also be doing a better job than many European countries – but it is a society already on a permanent warlike footing. It is easier to adapt when you have adapted already. It is much harder when you are making it up as you go along.In recent years, it has sometimes appeared that global politics is simply a choice between rival forms of technocracy. In China, it is a government of engineers backed up by a one-party state. In the west, it is the rule of economists and central bankers, operating within the constraints of a democratic system. This creates the impression that the real choices are technical judgments about how to run vast, complex economic and social systems.But in the last few weeks another reality has pushed through. The ultimate judgments are about how to use coercive power. These aren’t simply technical questions. Some arbitrariness is unavoidable. And the contest in the exercise of that power between democratic adaptability and autocratic ruthlessness will shape all of our futures. We are a long way from the frightening and violent world that Hobbes sought to escape nearly 400 years ago. But our political world is still one Hobbes would recognise.• David Runciman is professor of politics at Cambridge University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cabc9fde0b838b0c7be4cfe68f2d0303199ac4c/0_0_6312_3790/master/6312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5822e2615624a03ada016feef2c0c065","title":"coronavirus lockdown affects arts workers","story":"We asked arts workers for their stories of how the lockdown is affecting their livelihoods. Here are their responsesThis week we asked arts workers to share how their livelihoods were being affected by the coronavirus. Since then, the UK government’s measures to give financial aid to the self-employed will help the sector – but many are still deeply concerned about the lack of work available in the coming months. Here are some of the nearly 150 stories we received. Thanks to everyone who got in touch.Stephen Laughton, 38, playwright and TV writerMy play, One Jewish Boy, opened in the West End on 10 March – a huge step up for me. I had TV deals lined up, a movie deal on the cards, another play about to start in New York. The play managed to stay open for one week. It got us to press night, and much like its original fringe run, was a critical success – four and five stars, and that first week was packed out. It was the moment I’d been waiting for. But I knew what was coming – a moment I hoped I would cherish for ever was tinged with crushing defeat. It felt as if everything we had worked for – all the abuse (my play is about antisemitism and I was on the receiving end of a lot of it), all the hard work, the blood, joy, sweat and tears – just faded away. The next day it got worse: I didn’t quite take in the monumental loss of having every gig I had lined up, cancelled. In the short term, I’m pretty screwed, the financial loss from the cancellation of two plays, a TV and a film gig has hit the tens of thousands. That makes it sound as if I always earn at this level – I don’t and I haven’t. I’ve been working hand to mouth and now, when it looked as if I might finally be able to breathe, I don’t know when I’ll get paid again. I just need to find a way to keep my head above water.Michael Heggett, 59, lighting engineerMy entire work calendar for 2020 went away in the three days from 16 March. I lost the Pet Shop Boys world tour and the Olympic Games, which amounts to nine months of solid work and around £60,000 gross turnover. I have no other work on my books until November, which is a UK tour with Tim Minchin – if it goes ahead. As venues are closed and also gatherings of people banned and film sets closed, I will not be able to earn a living for the foreseeable time. My business and livelihood are completely destroyed.Matthew Reed, 40, comedianI had a full diary of gigs, a full summer of festivals and various clubs around the country, then overnight nothing, wiping out every penny for the foreseeable. My agents, Getcomedy, have been brilliant, but there’s no work, so they, too, are in a terrible situation. I’m a compere and in demand – I play every major club on the circuit and have done for years. So to go from every weekend full and plenty of midweek gigs to zero has been terrifying. The fragility of my situation has y crept up on me, and it’s also shown how little people really care. At a comedy night, if you do well you’re told: “Well done”, back slapped, thanked for a good night. “Couldn’t do what you do mate. It takes balls.” Now my entire income has gone I’ve been told, “Well, you’re just a comedian!” and, “Get a proper job.” I’ve had “proper” jobs – I’ve worked very hard to be where I am and comedy is a job. I’ve travelled miles for 20-minute sets, and the pay has been the same since I started – our wages haven’t gone up with inflation. People assume we are on a fortune, which just isn’t true. I absolutely love being a comedian, and this has been the worst thing that’s ever happened to me professionally. But apparently it’s not as valid as an office worker losing their “proper job”.Anonymous, actor for 37 yearsAfter a good five months in theatre and television and feeling as if I was turning a corner after a difficult period, I found the rug pulled from under my feet. Future work cancelled. Income owed not likely to be received. No hope of working in my career for many, many months to come. I am already writing this year off. My industry has been decimated and the aftermath will be catastrophic. I do not know how I will survive this with no savings behind me. I love my job, but I feel totally broken and my mental health is very, very fragile.Denise Francis, 55, director of theatre education company Firehorse ProductionsI had three actors on contract for a five-week tour in June and July – this has now been cancelled, as schools are shut. There may be a slight chance we can scramble a three-week tour for November, but it is the two autumn tours that sustain us throughout the year, and not being able to produce them jeopardises the future of Firehorse. Two years ago, I also established the charity Afan Arts, giving the opportunity to pupils from surrounding schools to work alongside professional actors and film crews. Our third project Same But Different, two years in the planning, was due to begin at the end of July, but this has had to be cancelled. The year 11 pupils were devastated, another thing they have missed out on. We invest in our actors, love to see them grow and flourish – now we will not see that this year. It has been like watching your world crumble.Anonymous, 37, actorOn 16 March, a couple of hours before our cast were due on stage, we were told our show was cancelled that evening with immediate effect. Since then, it has become apparent that the production will not reopen anytime soon, and as yet we have no clarity on whether we will continue to be paid. My biggest fear is that our producer may be forced to use the force majeure clause in our contracts, allowing them to terminate our employment with immediate effect. Were that to happen, I would be left £40,000 out of pocket, that figure representing what I would have earned during the remainder of the show’s run.Colette Meacher, writer, editor and lecturerI’ve had mild symptoms of Covid-19, but as I effectively work on zero-hours contracts I’m not eligible for statutory sick pay. And, as it’s now the Easter break, my teaching hours are finished and my freelance editing and writing work has dried up, meaning that I don’t have a single commission or job on my desk. I’m stressed, sick and skint – but I’d still be working if I could as I urgently and desperately need some money for the mortgage, bills and, heck, even just to be able to go out and buy some food. It’s been nearly four weeks since I last got paid, and that was a grand total of £600 – pretty good by most months’ standards.Mike Nichamin, 56, live audio systems engineerAll touring is off as venues have closed and large gatherings banned. I was on tour in Europe at the time with the show An Evening with Whitney Houston, a hologram tour. I have now applied to Tesco as a delivery driver for £9 an hour, which won’t even cover my expenses.Bethany, 20, dancerI’m supposed to be moving to Greece at the end of March for a seven-month contract, but obviously with no flights this has been postponed for the foreseeable. This is extremely distressing as for dancers a summer season can sometimes be their only income for the year. With so much uncertainty, I’m not sure if I will ever get there to complete the season, and in the meantime I’m stuck in the UK with no income.Anonymous, 30, artistAs a self-employed artist, my work is piecemeal and precarious. I don’t have a fixed income and my earnings fluctuate month to month. I’m still in receipt of the ghostly working tax credits, which has been a lifeline in more difficult times but at £54 a week are not enough to live on. Occasionally I sell a work, pick up some teaching hours or am successful with a funding application. While the financial impact of Covid-19 is massive on those working in the arts, the impact of coronavirus goes beyond the loss of wages – it affects our visibility. Projects which have been in the pipeline for many months are put on hold, or no longer possible. Perhaps they lose their relevance as this global crisis escalates as it has. Galleries and cultural spaces rearrange their programmes, pushing an already competitive workforce into greater competition for places. This situation is complicated for us all, but without support, we risk a whole generation of artists slipping away.David, 32, artist and gallery workerMany artists work freelance as either an assistant to a more established artist, or as a technicianhandler for museums and galleries. I fall in this latter group. I love the work – we do anything from packing up prints to building gallery walls or making bespoke elements of the exhibition. With museums and galleries closed until further notice, the workforce who build and hang the exhibitions are simply not required. The work is always seasonal, and so we have large chunks of work booked months ahead, knowing that we have a two- to three-month gap in work while the exhibition is open to the public. I’ve had a mixed response to coronavirus closures. One gallery has said that it will honour booked work and pay freelancers regardless of whether we are physically able to complete the job. This is absolutely wonderful and will help hugely. It is, however, an exception rather than the norm. Most galleries and museums have cancelled work – I’ve lost work equivalent to two and a half months’ pay, and from talking to friends, that seems quite light.Jonny Byers, 39, cellistI had a full diary of work, and every single concert until at least July has been cancelled or, at best, postponed. An entire tour of a Handel opera a week of Beethoven symphonies concerts at smaller venues such as the Wigmore Hall. A completely empty diary, which means £0 coming in. Many of the groups I perform for won’t have a large amount of financial reserves so are now walking an even thinner tightrope attempting to ride out this storm. I have bills, instrument insurance, not to mention food buying, and many other outgoings to attempt to cover with no idea how it’s all going to pan out. Sadly, everyone is in the same boat right now, but once orchestras are gone, they’re gone, and we’ll need music more than ever after this.Dan, 37, stage managerOne show was cancelled mid-run and we were told not to come in the next day. The following job, which was supposed to take me to July, was postponed until 2021. All income has stopped and with no help from the government so far, we have had to contact our landlords and bill providers to plead for a payment break. We will get to a point where we have to choose between paying bills and eating. There is no safety net. I am also in the unfortunate situation that I have a very sick relative in hospital which, added to the worry about no income and possible eviction, is having a huge detrimental effect on my mental health.Anonymous, 30, freelance stage managerSo far, I have lost out on thousands. Last week, the tour that I was working on was cancelled after the government urged people not to go out. There were no compensation measures as all insurances were void when the WHO declared the virus a pandemic. The promoter took their fee back, tickets were refunded and the artist made a huge loss. All future bookings have been postponed too. A two-month project that I was meant to start on 1 April has been pushed back, but we don’t know when that will be rescheduled. Festivals have been cancelled. My next working day is currently 1 July, but that could also be postponed. That’s three and a half months of loss of earnings – and to add salt to my wounds, I’m due to get married overseas in September.Clare, 51, self-employed art tutorAs a result of the current situation I closed the studio last week. Many of the artists who attend are over 70, and although the classes are small I can’t guarantee safety. I have set up a WhatsApp group to keep us all in touch with each other – we share experiences, jokes and thoughts as well as art-related articles. Today, I launched an online art class to which nearly 40 of the group have signed up. So far, it seems to be working despite my lack of techie knowledge – think Acorn Antiques level of production. I hope this will provide some income to tide me over until I can reopen the studio, and will keep the social element of the group together.Anonymous, 45, community artistI work full time in the community and all my work is on freelance contracts. In two days, every project I have got cancelled as they are all people-based. I have no income, no sick pay, and my work diary is a black hole. I am used to uncertainty and flexibility in my work, but now I feel totally baffled as to how I will get an income. I don’t know when or if these projects will ever be rescheduled, and I worry about some of the people I work with who depend on the social aspect of these arts projects – one project I worked on involves making artworks for a recovery garden, for people with addictions, and I worry about how they are coping alone. We will be needed to help restore community spirit when this crisis is over – arts are never valued by the government, yet people are surviving these hard times through creativity and resourcefulness.Peter, 44, freelance opera singerThe theatres are shut. I’m fortunate enough to have current extra chorus contracts honoured, but future ones are undecided. With schools, each one has its own safeguarding policy and setting up teaching from home is problematic – hours are down already. All of the concerts I’ve had lined up are postponed or cancelled, auditionstoo. Regular chorister work in synagogue has stopped and the church that I regularly sing at are paying up to June. My private teaching has stopped – even though it’s a few students, over time you really start to feel it. I’m losing more than half of my income, with projected expectations that the industry will suffer longer and there will be less work in the future. I will need to adapt and find other sources.Gillian Garrity, 48, theatre producerMy business partner, Margaret-Anne O’Donnell, and I started our own producing company, Raw Material Arts, two years ago. We have worked in the theatre industry for more than 20 years each, touring theatre within the UK and across the world. A UKAustralian co-production that was due to tour to 12 venues across Scotland beginning next month has been cancelled a tour to an arts festival in Egypt has been cancelled an artist residency due to take place in Nepal has been cancelled we have three midlarge scale co-productions with three Scottish venues now on hold a New York transfer of a current production on hold. Our potential to earn income has frozen. We work with and employ directors, lighting designers, sound designers, actors, stage managers, costume designers and many more freelance artists. We have received support from Creative Scotland to pay our team for projects that have taken place andor are already funded, but we cannot deliver. We have no means to rehearse or present any work, meaning we have no potential to earn income.Anonymous, 39, stage managerI don’t know anyone who’s still working, the entire industry has gone. The theatres all shut once Boris Johnson advised people not to go – there was no more work to do. I went to help clear the rehearsal room we had been using and that was that. I’ve worked since I was 17, I’ve never not had a job. I’ve always paid my taxes and I’ve used the benefits system once to cover a gap of five weeks between contracts back when I first moved to London in 2009. Now I don’t know what to do. My partner is in the same position and has lost a year’s work, as has my sister, as have most of my friends. We have a little bit of a buffer, probably enough to survive the next month or two, but beyond that things are pretty scary.

I’ve been in a tiny room for weeks and I’m strugglingTuesdayBoth my fiancee and I are marketing postgraduate students. We live in halls but study at different universities. She lives in London, and I live in Surrey. I am a care leaver while she is an international student from Wuhan, China.My day begins at 4am, when I lie awake in my girlfriend’s flat. We have been here for three weeks self-isolating. The room is cramped I am on an airbed next to her single bed (she has a back problem, which is why we sometimes avoid sharing the single). I put the airbed away and make a bitter morning coffee, have a vape out the window and watch the sunrise.I procrastinate on my phone for four hours looking at memes, avoiding work at all times as anxiety is high. Dinner time comes. We use her rice cooker to make some pasta while putting some tinned food in the electric slow cooker, all in the tiny bedroom. We eat, have a brief argument, watch some YouTube videos and go to bed. We did not even leave the room to use the shared kitchen.I check my emails again and I see another from my university: it’s now closed. I panic again and start to worry about the uni booting my stuff out of my own halls. I debate whether I should travel through London to my flat but for the sake of mine and my partner’s health, I decide against it. Thankfully, it seems my halls will remain open as I would be homeless if they shut. All my lectures are now online.ThursdayToday I was informed by the job centre that I could not get universal credit as I am a postgraduate student. I’m advised to increase my student overdraft. The problem is that I can’t. I’m a Greek citizen, though I’ve lived in the UK my whole life. I currently don’t have a passport as I lost it and have to wait a year to have another. My bank does not accept Greek identity cards which is the only identity card that I have. I have a limited ID check on my account, so I can’t increase my overdraft. I’m not eligible for a driving licence either because I am bipolar, which is why I cannot have an overdraft or travel anywhere else.FridayI wake up 20 minutes before my online seminar. Everything goes surprisingly well, apart from microphone problems. I particularly like the fact I can vape while attending class.After the seminar I gaze outside, pondering how I have managed to stay in a 12m2 room with an ensuite toilet for three weeks and how it resembles the time I was hospitalised under the Mental Health Act. Is this all a dream? Am I still in the hospital? No, I am not, I am with someone who loves me and appreciates me: my partner. I think about how this is hard for her, first her family in lockdown, now her. I am thinking about the sinophobia she and our Chinese friends in the UK, many of who are self-isolating because of their origin, are facing now.SaturdaySince the university is closed, I might as well build a university in my makeshift village in Minecraft. I forget to turn off the zombie raids however now they are all getting infected. My villagers must study from home as well, it seems. How fitting.SundayI wake up at 7pm. I need to sort my sleep routine. Boris comes out and announces the lockdown. No weddings, he says – that’s the civil partnership ceremony that my fiancee and I have planned cancelled, then. We both start worrying about being separated after her tier 4 visa expires."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caef1fbddddbbbebb686830615f0558531475333/0_0_5295_3178/master/5295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d874ed6ccdb5ad3767a8a6ecd0c9aa5","title":"school closures prompt boom in private tuition online isolation","story":"Surge in demand for online tuition, while rich families take tutors into isolation with themThe private tuition industry is booming amid the coronavirus pandemic, with school closures and fears of infection driving unprecedented demand for online teaching.UK tutoring firms said there had been a surge in online tuition in the past three weeks as parents anticipated and then responded to the decision to close schools indefinitely.Meanwhile, several agencies said some wealthy families had requested tutors go into isolation with them on remote country estates or super-yachts.Leo Evans, a co-founder of The Profs, a tuition firm that works with around 2,000 schoolchildren and 3,000 university students internationally each year, said: “There has been a hike in online tutoring related to existential concerns around the coronavirus and schools being shut.”Evans said the number of daily users of its online classroom platform BitPaper had risen more than sixfold in two weeks, from 5,000 to 32,000 . “There were 11,000 hours of online classes on Monday, almost a fifteenfold rise from 750 hours on 2 March,” he said. “It’s absolutely exploded since the coronavirus.” “There’s been a huge shift,” she said. “Most homeschooled students in London have transitioned to online learning this week, and those families who can are staying in the countryside. This week 16 new homeschoolers have joined. We have another 11 starting after the Easter break.”Titley said a drop-off in demand for GCSE revision as a result of the cancellation of exams had been more than offset by demand for other tutoring. For example, private schools were continuing to assess key-stage three pupils, aged 11-14, and after Easter some schools will start A-level courses for those pupils who were due to do GCSEs this summer. One of the Golden Circle’s clients, Claudine Ries, who lives in central London, has switched to online tutoring for her 16-year-old son who is studying for US exams.She said: “We are trying to socially isolate by seeing fewer friends and staying away from large crowds. We switched to online tutoring mainly because we felt it would unnecessarily expose the tutors who need to travel to our house while they could be isolating themselves at home.”Adam Caller, the founder of Tutors International, which caters to rich families, said he had received several requests from clients in the past few weeks for tutors to go into isolation with them at short notice.“We’ve seen a sudden rush, especially from Switzerland,” said Caller. “They’re looking for tutors who are willing to come and be locked in. One family has relocated from an area affected by the Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy to St Moritz in the Swiss Alps.“Another family, from Dubai, want to go and hide on their super-yacht in the Mediterranean. It’s paying £24,000 a month to the tutor.”Mark MacLaine, the founder of Tutorfair, said one tutor had gone into isolation with a family in upstate New York, and another family who had flown to the Caribbean to escape the outbreak were now receiving online tuition.MacLaine said the additional demand was a boost to Britain’s private tuition sector, worth an estimated £2bn.He said this year could be his highest earning yet because so many families were looking for private tuition due to the uncertainty over the next academic year.“A few of my A-level students have decided to resit their exams next year but most want to keep working,” he said. “A couple of parents said they’ll have their kids resit their GCSEs in their A-level year if they have to.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc63932315d2ab8fbcb83575c103add1e5d1f9ba/149_0_1726_1035/master/1726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90759b5ba4c348c46bf3fa93ed1f2343","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including a puma on the streets of Santiago, Chile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6082abfab527e852fd69c9a4931c11bc87029d5a/346_148_2875_1725/master/2875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dcfed27464db89731c6b8883988d5ad","title":"players refusal to compete could stall return of premier league and efl","story":"Attempts to resume the Premier League and English Football League seasons after 30 April could be thwarted by players refusing to ­compete because of the coronavirus pandemic.Premier League, English Football League and ­Professional Footballers’ Association ­ officials held a conference call on Friday to discuss a unilateral response to the threat posed to clubs and players by the crisis, along with the prospect of resuming their seasons “when it is safe and conditions allow”. But even the possibility of playing matches behind closed doors after 30 April appears remote with players concerned about putting their health, and their ­families’ health, at risk by returning to work while the crisis continues.Players’ representatives are also understood to be exploring whether insurance policies could be declared null and void should their clients contract a potentially career-­threatening illness after playing again while being aware of the risks involved.The professional leagues and clubs continue to follow government advice regarding the pandemic and playing behind closed doors is one of several contingency measures being discussed. The resumption of the league seasons, future transfer ­windows, player contracts that are due to expire on 30 June and wage deferrals or reductions were the main topics of Friday’s conference call.No decisions were taken by the three parties – the next Premier League stakeholders’ meeting is scheduled for next Friday, 3 April – but there is recognition that a broad consensus is required to ­prevent several lower league clubs going bankrupt.A joint statement released on Friday read: “The Premier League, EFL and PFA met today and discussed the growing seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was stressed that the thoughts of all three organisations continue to be with everyone affected by the virus.“The Premier League, EFL and PFA agreed that difficult decisions will have to be taken in order to mitigate the economic impact of the current suspension of professional football in England and agreed to work together to arrive at shared solutions. The leagues will not recommence until 30 April at the earliest. They will only do so when it is safe and conditions allow. Further meetings will take place next week with a view to formulating a joint plan to deal with the difficult ­circumstances facing the leagues, their clubs, players, staff and fans.”Leeds, who are top of the Championship, agreed a wage deferral on Thursday when their manager, ­Marcelo Bielsa, players, coaching staff and club executives reached a deal that will protect the incomes of 272 other employees at Elland Road. Blackburn are in negotiations to follow suit. Wage deferrals must be agreed inidually by clubs, rather than being imposed centrally by the EFL.The Premier League is not facing the same financial pressure as EFL clubs but, while not at the same stage of considering wage deferrals, some members of the lucrative top flight believe they will have to come into play should the season remain suspended for ­several more months.Fifpro, the world players’ union, has expressed concern that clubs “in more than half a dozen countries” have terminated players’ contracts or reduced salaries since the pandemic began. “At a time of such a significant social crisis, solutions must be found with everybody’s contribution,” the union said in a statement on Friday. “Most football players outside the world’s biggest leagues are earning at the same level or below average domestic income and would be severely affected by salary decreases.”Manchester United, meanwhile, have reiterated their commitment to completing the current Premier League season but have informed season ticket holders they can expect a pro-rata rebate or refund if matches are played behind closed doors or cancelled. The club “fully supports the collective intent to complete the Premier League, FA Cup and the Uefa club competitions”, it stated on Friday, following reports that a growing number of Premier League clubs want to end the campaign with immediate effect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02afdfe606b8a7a52524fa10360e5fd720e5fa49/0_367_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f935a7de3a200c2ae49ca6ae0d54a09f","title":"lets move to linlithgow west lothian","story":"There’s still romance here, but the seat of monarchs has given way to humble, suburban dreamsWhat’s going for it?

Nothing wrong with stacking shelves or, indeed, Lidl. But Linlithgow has known grander times. This, I’ll have you know, is the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, and it has the palace to prove it, ta-dah on its hilltop pedestal, as if anyone could ignore it. Don’t you know who I was? True, the palace lacks a roof these days. Yet this palace gave birth to Mary, Queen of Scots. This palace was the centre of the Stuart dynasty. This palace’s fountain once flowed with wine, it’s said, for the marriage of James V and Mary of Guise. Still, those days have long gone. Although there’s romance still in its polished old streets, today it’s a romance designed, not as a stage set for monarchy, political intrigue and government, but for more humble, suburban dreams, and propping up house prices. Linlithgow has grown accustomed to its new role: capital of Silicon Glen, Queen of Middle Scotland, provider of comfy sofas and Netflix filming locations to the strivers of Edinburgh and Glasgow.The case against… It’s a small town of commuters: kids and beatniks will want to escape – though worry not, the fleshpots of Edinburgh and Glasgow are nearby.

This second album from his alliance with assorted South African musicians is both calmer and more ominous than his work with the Comet Is Coming and Sons of Kemet. There are no synth squalls and fractured beats – instead, Hutchings’s tenor and clarinet are pitched against an acoustic ensemble driven by double bass and awash with Fender Rhodes piano, an approach that often echoes South Africa’s distinct jazz lineage.The mood is futurist, however. Hutchings is fond of apocalyptic warnings, and the fiery declamations here, co-written with poet Siyabonga Mthembu, are suitably full of dread, beginning with the compulsive 10-minute blast of They Who Must Die. Another strand to Hutchings’s playing is its lyrical, contemplative quality, captured by the churchy Go My Heart, Go to Heaven, the rootsy, determined We Will Work (on Redefining Manhood) and the husky closer Teach Me to Be Vulnerable. Such pieces are a counterpoint to Hutchings’s talk of “what happens when life as we know it can’t continue”. A remarkable, shamanic talent.

Now he hopes to lead his party without picking a sideWhen John Erskine signed up a teenage Keir Starmer to the Labour club at Leeds University freshers’ week in 1982, he had hoped to find a new recruit in the factional dogfight raging inside the party.But he was disappointed. Erskine recalls the young law student’s politics as being of the “non-aligned, conscience-driven left” – something like a kind of political Methodism.Instead of joining in the running battles with Militant, Starmer took the view there were “no enemies on the left” and cracked on with his studies.The overwhelming favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, who steps down next weekend, Starmer has defied categorisation, declining to become a fully paid-up member of any of Labour’s many overlapping sects.He is neither a Corbynite nor a Blairite (to the extent that they still exist) and is irritated by other people’s urge to pigeon-hole him.Speaking to the  as he launched his pitch for the leadership last December, he said: “I don’t find the badging of people helps, really. I don’t need somebody else’s name tattooed on my head to know what I think. There are fundamental principles.”Starmer arrived at Leeds from Reigate grammar school, the only one of five siblings from a modest semi-detached house in Oxted, Surrey, to get to university.He has spoken movingly about his mother’s 50-year battle with Still’s disease, which ultimately led to her being confined to a wheelchair and unable to eat. “She wouldn’t have moaned. If you’d asked her how she was, she’d say ‘fine, how are you?’,” he said.After a postgraduate degree at Oxford, Starmer moved to London where he shared a rickety flat in Archway with old school friends.He joined the fashionably radical Doughty Street Chambers while carrying out pro-bono work for a string of apparently lost causes.Conor Foley, an international human rights lawyer and aid worker who now lives in Brazil, worked alongside Starmer at the campaign group Amnesty International in the 90s.The pair wrote a pamphlet, Foreign Policy, Human Rights and the UK, in 1998, making a string of recommendations, many of which were subsequently taken up by the Labour government.Tony Blair’s incorporation of the provisions of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) into UK law in the Human Rights Act catapulted Starmer and his fellow human rights lawyers from the lefty fringe of their profession to the mainstream, as the judiciary scrambled to absorb its implications.“There were various people who were, three years before, on the unacceptable left, suddenly found themselves in positions of authority,” says Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the LSE and another old friend. “Because we knew about it and nobody else did.”Foley agrees. “The Human Rights Act - there are probably four or five people in Britain who got that legislation and understood the importance of that legislation, and Keir and I were two of them. There were other people who played a more prominent role. But he has always understood the strategic significance of international human rights law.”Foley says that while the pair were working together at Amnesty he didn’t sense any burning ambition in Starmer to enter party politics. “That wasn’t where we were at. I think he wanted to be a human rights lawyer. I think that was really his dream.”And anyway the Labour party of the time wasn’t much to their liking, he says. “The Blairite party wouldn’t have been something either of us were comfortable with. Not that we were anti, we just weren’t that comfortable with it.”Starmer’s appointment as director of public prosecutions (DPP) – a campaigning human rights lawyer turned the nation’s chief prosecutor – surprised some of his radical friends.Leftwing critics tend to describe his five-year stint at the top of the 6,000-strong Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) as the final stage in Starmer’s metamorphosis from firebrand QC to well-coiffed pillar of the establishment.They point to the all-night court sittings held to administer swift punishment to the 2011 rioters – which Starmer subsequently claimed had helped quell the disorder and tough prosecuting guidance that imposed sentences of up to 10 years on benefits fraudsters.A close ally of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the Salford MP and shadow business secretary has been groomed as a potential leftwing contender for the top job.Pitch\u0026nbspPromising to champion “progressive patriotism”.The Wigan MP has built a reputation as a campaigner for her constituency and others like it, many of which have fallen to the Tories. A soft-left candidate, she resigned from the shadow cabinet in 2016 over Corbyn’s leadership and handling of the EU referendum.Pitch\u0026nbspWants to “bring Labour home” to voters that have abandoned the party in its traditional strongholds.Ambitious former director of public prosecutions has led the charge for remain in the shadow cabinet. He was instrumental in shifting Labour’s position towards backing a second referendumPitch\u0026nbspLaunched his campaign by highlighting how he has stood up for leftwing causes as a campaigning lawyer, and unveiled the slogan “Another Future is Possible”, arguing Labour can win again if we make the moral case for socialismSome inidual cases are also regularly raised, though Starmer’s friends insist they are impossible to judge without knowing what advice he received at the time.The decision not to prosecute the policeman involved in the death of Ian Tomlinson in the G20 protests was widely criticised at the time, not least by Tomlinson’s stepson, Paul King.His decision was subsequently reversed after an inquest found that Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed, but the police officer, Simon Harwood, was ultimately cleared of manslaughter in 2012.Gearty defends Starmer’s overall record at the CPS, saying he managed to forge new policy ground by developing frameworks of guidance in controversial areas such as assisted dying, alongside the traditional role of making decisions on inidual cases.“That is such a hard thing for any of us to do: to be both reactive, and also to have the capacity to be able to engage and drive the agenda.”Both of these skills should have better prepared him for life in Westminster. But his legal background hasn’t enamoured him to everyone.He was persuaded to run for parliament in 2015 in part by his longtime friend Ed Miliband, whose London home is not far up the Northern line from the Victorian terrace in Kentish Town that Starmer shares with his wife, Vicky, and two children.Labour appeared set to win, and he told his local paper, the Ham and High: “I’ve got my eyes set on winning Holborn and St Pancras and then doing whatever I can do to help a Labour government change the things that need changing.”Instead he found himself in a parliamentary party relegated to opposition and wracked with ision.During the darkest days of the Brexit drama, when Labour became embroiled in one parliamentary clash after another, Starmer was often criticised by colleagues for being too much a lawyer and not enough a politician.One shadow cabinet colleague laughingly cites his resignation as shadow immigration minister in 2016, at the later stages of the mass exodus from Jeremy Corbyn’s team in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, as an example of his lawyerliness. “It’s a classic – you have to read it three times to see what he’s saying.”In it, Starmer said the “challenge of leadership” was different in the light of the referendum result, but that he had “maintained his support” for the embattled Corbyn until most of his team resigned. “It is simply untenable now to suggest that we can offer an effective opposition without a change of leader,” he concluded.Whatever his qualms about the leadership, Starmer made the fateful choice to go back on to the frontbench in October 2016 after Corbyn convincingly saw off Owen Smith’s challenge.In the following three years he played a crucial – and, to some colleagues, infuriating – role in inching his party towards supporting a second EU referendum.He chaired the “compositing” meeting of grassroots delegates at the 2018 conference in Liverpool that resulted in a referendum finding its way into Labour policy as an “option” that should remain “on the table”.He earned rapturous applause from the remain-supporting membership when he used his speech to drop in the idea – then anathema to the leadership – that if another poll were held, remain would have to be on the ballot paper.There followed many months of parliamentary wrangling with the Tories in public, and political clashes among Labour’s most senior figures in private.Starmer styled himself as the torchbearer for the composite – and thus for the idea that a referendum couldn’t be ruled out.In public, he stuck scrupulously to the letter of every iteration of Labour policy. But in private, says one shadow cabinet colleague, the discussions were more robust.“He stretched the case as far as he could go but not to a point where he could be said to be out of line. But in the private meetings he was pushing very much harder. At every stage, we felt, and I said this many times, this is just a fucking ratchet.”Some former MPs who lost their seats in pro-Brexit constituencies blame Starmer, in part, for the party’s policy, which took many months of wrangling to arrive at and which infuriated leave voters.He insists it was a sensible way of dealing with a deeply ided party, with a deeply ided electorate, that once arrived at was not explained or sold to the public.Certainly he made few frontline media appearances during the campaign, instead touring local constituencies to boost morale with members and candidates, a role he had also played in 2017, awarding himself the moniker Captain Marginal.Is he now more politician than lawyer? Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the House of Lords, who has sat in the shadow cabinet throughout Starmer’s time in parliament, believes so.“I don’t think anybody who’s dealt with the Labour party, the shadow cabinet, the issues that he’s dealt with over the past few years, could be accused of not being a politician,” Lady Smith says.“He’s not the kind of weirdly Machiavellian type some people associate with the word politician, but he gets the politics of an issue.”Erskine, who has watched Starmer’s progress from afar since the Leeds days, says “everything is of a piece. It’s of conscience, it’s about incredible intellectual rigour, it’s about being measured. And whilst it’s not me, I have a lot of respect for it.”That measured style until recently appeared out of political fashion. Whatever Corbyn’s shortcomings, he was capable of rousing passion in his army of supporters. Even Starmer’s most staunch supporters concede that is not really his style.One old friend recalls asking him to make a speech to a school about how he had risen from a pebble-dashed semi in Oxted to the top of his profession. It was an inspirational story, he recalls, but not an inspirational speech. “He’s no David Lammy, Keir.”Another cites what they recall as a serviceable but not outstanding address at the funeral of his predecessor in the Holborn and St Pancras seat, Frank Dobson, last December, with the great and the good of the Labour party, including four past and present leaders, in the congregation.One mourner recalls a non-plussed Labour grandee muttering afterwards: “That’s the trouble with Keir: he doesn’t rise to the occasion.”But Smith, who has seen Starmer up close over the past five years, has little sympathy for those who complain that he lacks pizzazz.“I get quite irritated when people talk about him being dull. He’s serious – and I rather like people being serious, particularly when you’re dealing with serious issues,” she says.And with politics-as-usual on hold as the world wrestles with Covid-19 and its consequences – which have already swept decades-long orthodoxies in their wake – she adds: “He’s a serious grownup politician. I think he’s the right person at the right time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbfde8dfc6100b17b163ecab0cfe9c1cd4ac2344/0_196_6048_3631/master/6048.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=855476f25db34dff8a9786a79c9736ef","title":"katie swan tennis aside coronavirus kansas","story":"British player is making use of enforced career break to organise care packages for delivery in her adopted home of WichitaWhile Covid-19 seeps daily into the consciousness of the White House, 1,200 miles away in Wichita, Kansas, a British tennis player is helping families who know poverty but are yet to feel the full impact of coronavirus.As Katie Swan waits for the Tour to resume – and for Wimbledon to decide whether or not to hold this year’s championships, scheduled to start on 29 June – she prepares part-time and turns the rest of her energies to helping disadvantaged people in her adopted city.The Bristol-born player has lived in Wichita for seven years with her mother, Nicki, her father, Richard, and her teenage brother, Luke. For the past fortnight, they have been sorting tinned food and other necessities in their garage, ready for distribution.“She decided when this coronavirus started that she wanted to support those families with groceries they couldn’t get, either because they were too scared to go out or, having too many kids, could not leave them at the house. Some still have to work while their kids are not in school. She has been going to the supermarket pretty much every day for the past two weeks, buying loads of groceries.“The other day my mother had a phone call from a single mum, with her son. She is not very well and she was crying down the phone. It was very emotional and she was so grateful. People want to help. It’s a really good community.”Swan, who has played only four matches this year – the last of them in an ITF tournament in Santa Fe in late February – is still ticking over. “I go to the club to practise a couple of hours a day, then come home to do my fitness. They are not as strict where I live, but I am sure it is going to come. Over in Kansas City, a few hours from where we live, they have gone into lockdown.”As for Wimbledon, who are likely to abandon the 2020 championships when they convene in emergency session next week, Swan said: “You cannot control anything that is going on in the world, other than taking the necessary precautions. If everyone does their best to stay hygienic, follow the guidelines, then hopefully Wimbledon has a chance of going ahead. But I have no idea if that will be the case or not.”Swan, languishing at 256 in the world and keen to return to the Tour, added, “I know the WTA, ITF and ATP are working hard to do their best. Nobody could have predicted this. I have no idea how the system is going to change or if it will change.“I am trying to take all the positives out of this. I had my 21st birthday on Tuesday. I know it is a shame I cannot be playing tournaments, but it is a silver lining that I got to spend the time with my family.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79856aad571916c8f97bddd9f95f1480aa35ddf1/0_78_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dc053f60739a8a099d6e0a61148a0bf","title":"open moves closer to postponement as ra looks at 2020 reschedule","story":"The R\u0026ampA is understood to be edging closer to a postponement of the Open Championship, amid a growing realisation golf’s oldest major cannot be held in July at Royal St George’s. An announcement could be made following talks next week, with the organisers hopeful of rescheduling the tournament for later in the year as a backup plan.With the Masters and US PGA Championship already postponed, the US Open and Open are the two men’s majors left in their designated spots. The US Open is due to start on 18 June at Winged Foot in New York and reports in the United States suggest an unsurprising postponement is imminent.With more than 200,000 spectators due to attend the Open, set for 16-19 July, there is a rising sense the coronavirus pandemic will not have settled sufficiently for the tournament to be staged in satisfactory form for players or fans. The Open clearly falls under “mass gathering” criteria, with issues relating to mass international travel also pertinent.The R\u0026ampA’s contingency has been the topic for deep discussion at high levels in recent days. Weather and light restrictions would theoretically leave September as the last month the Open can be played. This year is the 149th playing of the Open, with No 150 scheduled for the home of golf, St Andrews, next July. With that in mind, the tournament’s organisers are anxious to hold their major this year. Any extended schedule delays could affect Royal Liverpool and Royal Troon, which have already been confirmed as venues for 2022 and 2023.The R\u0026ampA pointed towards their statement of last Thursday when asked for an update on the Open. In it, the chief executive, Martin Slumbers, said: “Our absolute priority is to ensure the safety of players, fans, officials, staff and all involved in our championships and that will be at the forefront of our thinking as we monitor developments.”It was announced on Friday that the Evian Championship, a women’s major, has been rescheduled for 6-9 August from 23-26 July. The August window was originally intended for the women’s Olympic golf tournament, before the Tokyo Games were postponed. It is thought the PGA of America also hopes to play the US PGA Championship, originally set for May, from 6 August at Harding Park in San Francisco.Meanwhile, the former US Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III and his wife escaped without injury after their home in St Simons Island, Georgia burned down early on Friday morning. “While everyone in our family is saddened at the loss of our home that was filled with so much laughter and incredible memories, we’re very blessed that everyone is safe and unharmed,” said Love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1360ac4e5c1fcb2be3e5f9c29e58b03889df5fd/0_52_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26c97678c6b469afe664feddbfdf3f70","title":"richard parks ski antarctica world record adventurers grand slam","story":"After a successful rugby career, including four appearances for Wales, Parks is now a world record holder in endurance skiingAs each of us languishes in isolation, one man is about to enter the Guinness Book of World Records for being on his own. When the next edition of every aspirant child’s bible comes out later this year, Richard Parks will be included for skiing more miles (2,299) in Antarctica, solo, unassisted and unsupported, than anyone else.If geographical isolation is the measure, no one has been lonelier. And yet over the phone in our new reality he can be heard handling the demands of his two-year-old son, Freddie, with aplomb, even as he handles those of this interviewer on the other end of the line.“Speaking frankly,” he says, when asked whether isolation is easier with wife and child in a flat in Cardiff Bay or on his own in the sprawling, frozen wilderness, “there are pros and cons. Every moment of every expedition I wish I was able to share it with my family and friends. It seems this cruel twist of fate has now landed us with exactly that wish. Managing the space together poses its own challenges. The other day I found Jo, who holds a pretty senior position, working in Freddie’s treehouse on the balcony in the flat.”Parks’s relationship with isolation is long and poignant. Forged in the boisterous rough and tumble of professional rugby, he was plunged into turmoil when his career, which included four caps for Wales, was cut short by a shoulder injury in 2009. In his award-winning autobiography, Beyond the Horizon, he describes how he retreated into the bare, white room at the back of the house his parents were renting. Crippled by despair and fear, he holed up for 21 days, emerging from the room only for the toilet and, from the house, for an operation on his ruined shoulder.“That first period of isolation was really painful,” he says. “I felt at sea with nothing to hold on to. I was completely powerless – over my emotions, over what had happened, the injury. That was terrifying, right. I can imagine there might be people going through feelings related to that now.”A line from his grandmother’s funeral two years earlier – “the horizon is only the limit of our sight” – had resonated so deeply he had it tattooed on his forearm. While staring at it in that white room, he was struck by an epiphany. His horizons had closed in, but thenceforth he would embrace the brilliant whiteness of mountains, wildernesses and the unknown, where the horizon stretches farther than anywhere else on earth.He launched himself into his new vocation, acquiring the skills of a mountaineer with remarkable facility. In 2011, he became the first to stand, in the same calendar year, at the highest peak of each of the seven continents and at the North and South Pole, known as the adventurers’ grand slam. He managed the feat in six and a half months.Since then, he has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity and worked with scientists as a kind of guinea pig at the extremes of human endeavour. But his current world record is not the one he had been seeking in his four expeditions to Antarctica, the first a training run in late 2012. Parks has been chasing a world record they say will never be broken.In 2011, his friend Christian Eide of Norway skied the 715 miles from Hercules Inlet on the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole in an astonishing 24 days, smashing the previous record of 39. The reason no one expects it to be broken is that the conditions were perfect throughout. Good weather is not something to rely upon in Antarctica, the driest, windiest and coldest continent.Parks, in that sunny Antarctic summer of 2011, was on the first two legs of his adventurer’s grand slam and testifies the weather has deteriorated since, becoming snowier, wetter and warmer. Despite the conditions, in 2014, he became the second-fastest skier to the South Pole, in a time of 29 days.The magnitude of the challenge beggars belief. A month’s worth of supplies and equipment must be hauled on a sled weighing roughly 70kg, as the challenger skis uphill from the coast to the Antarctic plateau, 3,000m above sea level, the height of an average Alp.Parks expended the calorific equivalent of two marathons a day in the most hostile environment on earth. Forced to abandon his second record attempt last year, because of even worse weather than usual, this year he skied for 16 hours a day, and slept for three, as he lowered his British record to 28 days in January. At halfway he was on course to break Eide’s world record. Then, sure enough, the weather turned, the wind howling at him from the pole with a chill factor of -45 degrees. By the time he finished, he had lost 14.5kg.“I’m genuinely at peace with it,” he says of the knowledge the speed record seems out of reach in the current climate. “There are some things I can’t control. That’s what makes this different from mainstream sport. And there’s a beauty in that.”He has not decided whether to try again. For now, the kind of isolation we are all wrestling with is preoccupying him more. “For any given expedition, there is years of preparation and training. With the current situation, we didn’t have that luxury. So we are all going through something akin to the grief curve.”Identifying and honouring what he can and cannot control is Parks’s mantra. Through it, he has transformed isolation from the scourge of his very soul to the field in which he is now a world-record holder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60e001f7b273498dbeae34a95f1ed7d59559c3b9/0_0_2559_1535/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c327d4c1d037618471870b0808aa315","title":"tokyo 2021 big sport circus give olympics back","story":"Games officials have the power to purge profiteering from elite competition and rewrite how we watch and enjoy sportCitius. Altius. Cancelled by a bat virus. In the end the decision to postpone the Olympic Games came as no surprise to anyone. Tokyo 2020 had struggled on manfully, like the last Japanese soldier still fighting the second world war from inside a small Pacific island copse in 1974. But there was never any doubt which way this was heading.Global plague trumps global sport every time and the degree of delay and fudge was just a function of the political and financial capital involved, the need to erect sufficient litigation-shields and anti-blame mechanisms.Nobody wants to be the general who announces defeat.The suggestion is Tokyo 2020 may now be rescheduled for spring 2021. In the meantime sympathy will be felt most keenly for the athletes, as it will for everyone else whose hopes for the future, daily routine and basic means of subsistence have been ripped apart by the Covid-19 pandemicStill, though. This is also a time for unvarnished truths. Whenever it does end up happening Tokyo 2020 will provide the usual mix of inidual human inspiration and mild economic stimulus. But it will also – and we can say this now – be stuffed full of bullshit, revved up on the deeply phoney and self-serving Big Sport model, these four-yearly events that circle the globe like mobile city states clearing the fields, raiding the public stores, favouring the local Maharajahs with their magic dust.The Olympic rescheduling is likely to cost an extra £2bn, indication in itself that the whole thing was already far too big. God only knows how that might look or feel in a time of global anxiety and deep economic depression. Is this a chance to do things differently?It is tempting to imagine the old certainties might just be swept away in times of macro-disaster, that there is also a kind of freedom here. During the London Blitz, George Orwell wrote about the railings coming down from the capital’s private squares as the army took charge of all spare iron. Suddenly every squit and herbert and passerby could play in these previously shuttered spaces. Orwell imagined the squares staying like this, how a new egalitarianism might change life for everyone, an obsession with shared public land that also touched on his unshakable hatred of golf courses.The iron railings went back up. These days the city is more opaque and unapproachable than ever before. But it doesn’t have to be like this. In Big Sport, as in so many areas of life, there is an opportunity here for a mass-correction, for a step-change in what we see as acceptable. Strip it back. Flush out the murky corners. Get rid of all the things you never needed anyway. Do we have the guts and the will to make it so?Here’s a more cheerful digression. The question for Tokyo 2020 is simple enough. Does it want to end up looking like something along the lines of the great lost Nazi Fifa World Cup of 1942, a grandiose, rather misjudged footnote, overtaken by the world falling apart around it?Or could it draw on the spirit and the practise of the Austerity Games of 1948, perhaps the most uplifting of all the modern Olympics, staged at a time when the world was still in chaos?No new venues were built for those games. The Olympic torch came down the Thames in a rowing boat. Athletes arrived at Fenchurch Street station to be greeted by village-level bunting and were then housed eight to a room on tubular steel wartime beds.Everyone looked thin and pale and desperately happy to be out running and jumping around. Harrison Dillard of the USA won the men’s 100m on a sodden cinder track that left him spattered with mud. Fanny Blankers-Koen won a thrilling women’s sprint double but almost missed the relay final because she’d popped out to buy a raincoat. The javelin took place by torchlight.By all accounts it was joyful and cathartic and an experience that came from an entirely different place to the machine world of modern-day Big Sport, that profiteering global circus that constantly tells you this, sport, belongs to someone else, that it is simply a circus to be consumed at a price.The Olympic Games is not the worst offender. It still offers those moments of inidual inspiration. But it does also tend to amplify the vices of those who seek to stage it. Beijing was an astonishing show of nation-state power but it cost £40bn and most of its venues lie rotting. Greece 2004 helped kill the local economy. London 2012 was a triumph of styling, but left behind declining participation and an ever more passive populace. Rio 2016 was a wonderful case study in elite-level corruption.Why propagate this? Why allow it to be the model? Nobody really likes the way Big Sport is arranged now, apart from the small minority that stand to benefit from it.There is still an opportunity to reset, to take out the chaff and the profiteering hangers-on. To revolt, for example, against Fifa’s reserves of £1.5bn and demand that money be given back or to get rid of the pernicious influence of gambling sponsors (if you need gambling to be interested in sport, you’re not interested in sport).And beyond this to rewrite the terms of every competition to favour inclusion and access, to ask constantly how easy is it for every member of society to play and watch and enjoy this sport.People will say this is impossible, that nothing can change. But does it really feel like that right now? Sport in the form it was intended, sport with the unhealthy additives taken away, sport in the spirit of London ’48 and Orwell’s railings. This is one thing we can still have."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c510d50227249488bfe3b804fd0c732d43c17d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9697bf85fcdc8d9a01396b869a633b","title":"the breadwinners of barishal how women in bangladesh are starting their own businesses","story":"Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross. From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c0bc9bc0c2cfc8701c78a3201d01ab4b1aad301/33_543_8122_4873/master/8122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06e75a59073bc6d0890f539662b4174a","title":"mehdi hasan interview","story":"The political interviewer on how he made it in the US and his anger at the deference the media has for Donald Trump which could cost lives during the pandemic‘We all know that the president is a pathological liar,” Mehdi Hasan says from his office in Washington DC. “But the lies he’s been telling about the coronavirus – they’re no joke they cost American lives. The US media’s failure to call Donald Trump out on those lies in real time makes part of the media, I’m sorry to say, partly complicit in those deaths, too.” Hasan, who moved from the UK to the US in 2015, is that rare species of TV interviewer: not in it to make friends, to network or to gain access. His passion for grilling his subjects is only matched by his frustration at his peers who do not do the same.When the White House press corps turned on the comedian Michelle Wolf after the 2018 White House correspondents’ dinner and defended Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, it was the last straw for him. In that moment, he realised that the US media is almost “irredeemable”.“If not now, when?” he asks. “If they’re not going to stand up against this administration’s secretary, then who?” A credulous New York Times headline in the wake of the 2019 El Paso shooting, “Trump Urges Unity vs Racism”, was, to him, just another stitch in the pattern of this submission. “The American press doesn’t want to rock the boat, and so things are just reported straight.”Such forthrightness has served Hasan well. Not only have his hard-hitting political interviews become regular viral hits, he has also become a fixture on the high-profile US cable news circuit. Rumours are beginning to circulate on the east coast about offers to host his own show on a US network. On such approaches he is coyly amused when I ask him, maintaining only that he very much loves his job at the moment.As an interviewer, he is relentless, a quality that boosted his profile after Trump came to office and the US media seemed unable to land a glove on the new president or his surrogates. As a columnist for the online magazine the Intercept and the host of UpFront and Head to Head on Al Jazeera English, Hasan has developed a reputation for somehow managing to nail dissimulating politicians by being forensic and refusing to move on until his point is made. His technique is simple. “Most people ask the question and move on whether they get an answer or not,” he says. “I don’t.”Hasan, 40, was already a successful journalist in the UK when he moved to the US to host an interview show for Al Jazeera English. An established pundit and political analyst with a erse journalistic background, he has worked in TV at Sky News and Channel 4, co-authored a book about Ed Miliband, and served stints as the political editor of the New Statesman and political director of the Huffington Post UK. For all that it seems like a charmed career, Hasan describes it as “random”. He started out on the bottom rung as a freelance news assistant at ITN and puts his success down to those “willing to take a chance” on him.But it was in the US where he really began to cut through. Clips of his Al Jazeera English interviews began to catch fire online. A clash with the Trump adviser and Fox News regular Steven Rogers in November 2018 heralded Hasan’s arrival in the mainstream. In it, he questions Rogers on Trump’s lies on birth right citizenship, among other falsehoods. Rogers starts out with bluster before quickly squirming and deflating under Hasan’s barrage.To date, a clip of the interview in which Hasan pummels Rogers has had almost 8m views on Twitter alone. It brought him to the attention of Seth Myers, who, when interviewing Hasan, called the Rogers interrogation “the template for talking to people within the Trump-sphere”. Hasan has recently also developed a following among Hollywood stars with an activist bent. Mark Ruffalo tweeted the Rogers interview saying: “There is such thing as the truth, even today. This is how a journalist does their job to uncover it.”But despite the rough edges, he is a public school boy, and he admits that the confidence his private schooling and Oxford education (he studied that favourite of future prime ministers, Politics, Philosophy and Economics), has been invaluable in compensating for the fact that there are very few people like him in the British or US media. The “outsiderness” was from being a Muslim and the son of immigrants.Even in the US, he says, the interviews that create a buzz are those by British interviewers: Emily Maitliss talking to Sean Spicer, or Andrew Neil to rightwing controversialist Ben Shapiro. “Shapiro lives on US TV, not just on Fox, on CNN, on Bill Maher and all sorts of shows. Why did it take Andrew Neil to come along and poke holes in the complete facade of Ben Shapiro? There’s a culture of deference not just to people in power, it’s the politeness. You have to get in people’s faces.”It is something he advises British journalists to do with Johnson, for whom Hasan interned at the Spectator, when the now prime minister was the magazine’s editor. He recalls a genial and polite Johnson, but remembers how the “untucking of the shirt and the ruffling of the hair” was clearly a deliberate act before meetings. While he does not believe that Johnson is as bad as Trump (who he says is “unique’ in his pathologies), he sees the danger of Johnson’s populism and the media’s complicity in both creating him and continuing to be soft on him. “I use the L-word, ‘lie’, I use the R-word, ‘racism’. In the Trump era, you have to be able to use these words. In the Brexit era, you have to be able to use these words. And there’s still a real shyness and reluctance for journalists to do that.”Hasan’s righteousness is infectious, but it has not always served him well. A zealous address he made over a decade ago to a Muslim congregation in the UK has cast a long shadow. The remarks are recycled and used against him by his opponents on a regular basis. His observations, caught on camera, on non-Muslims (“cattle”), homosexuals and atheists, are hard to style out. He has addressed these comments often, most recently on Twitter, where he said: “Like a lot of journos (humans?) I’ve said things years ago that I now deeply regret.”When I ask him about this, he is prepared. “Dumb comments,” he says. But his contrition is laced with a defiance, because he believes that non-Muslims are not held to account in the same way. “Boris Johnson’s comments haven’t stopped him from being prime minister, ones he hasn’t even disowned. Why?” he asks. “Because I’m Muslim there’s no debate about that.”His argument is borne out by an incident last July when Marco Rubio posted a clip of a 2018 Hasan interview with Ilhan Omar, aggressively edited to make her appear racist against white people. “It increases abuse and death threats to her, and to me. I wish I could switch off,” he says. The political climate in the US is one of constant threat to public figures such Omar and himself.Despite the prejudice and scrutiny that he says he and other Muslims and minorities in the public eye face, he sees a counterintuitive solidarity with Muslims developing in the US. Trump has been so nakedly Islamophobic and xenophobic that it has pushed “many people off the fence”, he thinks. The “silver lining” is that the open season on Muslims and immigrants has created a group of Trump’s opponents that is happy to support them. Hasan’s American experience is of a country that is becoming less Islamophobic and less anti-immigration, even as Trump’s Islamophobic rhetoric intensifies. He maintains that he has been embraced warmly by many in the US media, and is often asked for interview tips.When talking about this welcome, an earnestness and warmth creeps into his voice. Hasan has clearly been on a journey over the past few years, and when he talks about what really drives him, the professional interlocutor tenor, which sometimes feels like a hammer dropping relentlessly on an anvil, changes to a softer tone. “Fundamentally it’s about one thing, it’s about avoiding the dehumanisation of other people,” he says. “The No 1 issue in my lifetime right now is tribalism. I’m going to be there for human rights and civil rights. When I see the stuff I said in my 20s, across the board should I have been more careful? Yes. Because you cannot speak about people in sweeping terms. That is the No 1 lesson of life.”That, however, doesn’t mean he holds back on sweeping terms when criticising the rest of the US media. Despite his success, Hasan’s style of journalism is in the minority. The media “gave Trump a free pass in 2015”, he frets, and Trump’s ongoing bigotry is still treated with “both sides” equivocation. “My biggest worry, frustration, regret, annoyance, is that they don’t seem to have learned many lessons and we seem to be going down the same path for 2020.”The media’s handling of Trump during the Covid-19 pandemic has given Hasan little reassurance. “When the president turns up at the White House briefing room and falsely claims there’ll be 5m tests within a month or that Google will be involved in the testing or that people are being tested at airports coming into the country, isn’t it shameful that even now, no reporter stands up and says: ‘Mr President, why should we believe a damn word you say?’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a62889d8e84ed1f44a195a5e2e2abe350737c70/0_31_2125_1275/master/2125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b308ac851bd916a8c9473d0a0ec7d3f","title":"lockdown tv which show would you like to rewatch with us","story":"As the coronavirus pandemic stops us from enjoying our favourites with our friends and family, come watch a classic from the BBC, ITV or Channel 4 with usLong gone are the days when the idiot box was seen as a solitary activity that rots your brain.

We are now where you will be in a few days. The epidemic’s charts show us all entwined in a parallel dance.We are but a few steps ahead of you in the path of time, just like Wuhan was a few weeks ahead of us. We watch you as you behave just as we did. You hold the same arguments we did until a short time ago, between those who still say “it’s only a flu, why all the fuss?” and those who have already understood.As we watch you from here, from your future, we know that many of you, as you were told to lock yourselves up into your homes, quoted Orwell, some even Hobbes. But soon you’ll be too busy for that.First of all, you’ll eat. Not just because it will be one of the few last things that you can still do.You’ll find dozens of social networking groups with tutorials on how to spend your free time in fruitful ways. You will join them all, then ignore them completely after a few days.You’ll pull apocalyptic literature out of your bookshelves, but will soon find you don’t really feel like reading any of it.You’ll eat again. You will not sleep well. You will ask yourselves what is happening to democracy.You’ll have an unstoppable online social life – on Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom…You will miss your adult children like you never have before the realisation that you have no idea when you will ever see them again will hit you like a punch in the chest.Old resentments and falling-outs will seem irrelevant. You will call people you had sworn never to talk to ever again, so as to ask them: “How are you doing?” Many women will be beaten in their homes.You will wonder what is happening to all those who can’t stay home because they don’t have one. You will feel vulnerable when going out shopping in the deserted streets, especially if you are a woman. You will ask yourselves if this is how societies collapse. Does it really happen so fast? You’ll block out these thoughts and when you get back home you’ll eat again.You will put on weight. You’ll look for online fitness training.You’ll laugh. You’ll laugh a lot. You’ll flaunt a gallows humour you never had before. Even people who’ve always taken everything dead seriously will contemplate the absurdity of life, of the universe and of it all.You will make appointments in the supermarket queues with your friends and lovers, so as to briefly see them in person, all the while abiding by the social distancing rules.You will count all the things you do not need.The true nature of the people around you will be revealed with total clarity. You will have confirmations and surprises.Literati who had been omnipresent in the news will disappear, their opinions suddenly irrelevant some will take refuge in rationalisations which will be so totally lacking in empathy that people will stop listening to them. People whom you had overlooked, instead, will turn out to be reassuring, generous, reliable, pragmatic and clairvoyant.Those who invite you to see all this mess as an opportunity for planetary renewal will help you to put things in a larger perspective. You will also find them terribly annoying: nice, the planet is breathing better because of the halved CO2 emissions, but how will you pay your bills next month?You will not understand if witnessing the birth of a new world is more a grandiose or a miserable affair.You will play music from your windows and lawns. When you saw us singing opera from our balconies, you thought “ah, those Italians”. But we know you will sing uplifting songs to each other too. And when you blast I Will Survive from your windows, we’ll watch you and nod just like the people of Wuhan, who sung from their windows in February, nodded while watching us.Many of you will fall asleep vowing that the very first thing you’ll do as soon as lockdown is over is file for orce.Many children will be conceived.Your children will be schooled online. They’ll be horrible nuisances they’ll give you joy.Elderly people will disobey you like rowdy teenagers: you’ll have to fight with them in order to forbid them from going out, to get infected and die.You will try not to think about the lonely deaths inside the ICU.You’ll want to cover with rose petals all medical workers’ steps.You will be told that society is united in a communal effort, that you are all in the same boat. It will be true. This experience will change for good how you perceive yourself as an inidual part of a larger whole.Class, however, will make all the difference. Being locked up in a house with a pretty garden or in an overcrowded housing project will not be the same. Nor is being able to keep on working from home or seeing your job disappear. That boat in which you’ll be sailing in order to defeat the epidemic will not look the same to everyone nor is it actually the same for everyone: it never was.At some point, you will realise it’s tough. You will be afraid. You will share your fear with your dear ones, or you will keep it to yourselves so as not to burden them with it too.You will eat again.We’re in Italy, and this is what we know about your future. But it’s just small-scale fortune-telling. We are very low-key seers.If we turn our gaze to the more distant future, the future which is unknown both to you and to us too, we can only tell you this: when all of this is over, the world won’t be the same."},{"url":null,"title":"anywhere but westminster we need your help covering the coronavirus","story":"For our second episode we want to focus on work, and what the Covid-19 outbreak has done to it.

FRP Advisory, the restructuring specialist, confirmed it was working with the chain, which has 73 branches and about 2,000 employees.The firm said in a statement: “FRP is working with the directors of Carluccio’s to consider all options for the company in the current climate.”Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The restaurant chain was founded by the late chef Antonio Carluccio in 1999. The plan to call in administrators, first reported by Sky News, follows a difficult period for casual dining chains, with tough competition and rising costs.In 2018, Carluccio’s landlords backed a restructuring plan in the form of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure that allowed it to shutter loss-making sites, and led to the closure of about 30 of its restaurants.Carluccio’s is controlled by the Landmark Group, the Dubai-based retail and hospitality conglomerate. At the time of the CVA, it promised to finance a multimillion-pound refurbishment for the restaurants unaffected by the CVA.Meanwhile, the rent-to-own firm BrightHouse, which has been accused of overcharging, will collapse into administration on Monday, putting 2,400 jobs at risk.The company – which sells household appliances and electrical goods on credit to primarily low-income customers – has been teetering on the brink for months after a regulatory crackdown on interest charges that reduced its income, but was tipped into failure by the economic stresses of the coronavirus outbreak.BrightHouse said costly compensation claims by customers after the crackdown were costing it £1m every month.It is understood that tentative restructuring plans were scrapped as the pandemic gained pace. The company – which is owned by a trio of investment funds, Alteri, Apollo and Highbridge – is expected to appoint Grant Thornton as administrators within days.Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, rising costs and broader economic problems as well as unseasonable weather. In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.\u0026nbspAt the same time, there is a move away from buying stuff as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no-deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs at the end of this year. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers.Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas – which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further potential Brexit wobbles to come – retailers are facing another tough year in 2020. The latest rise in the national minimum wage in April will also add to costs and hit profits. On the plus side, there are hopes of a boost to the housing market from increased certainty about Brexit after the general election. There are also signs that the shift to online shopping is slowing, potentially easing the pressure on high streets.A spokesman for BrightHouse said: “The national response to the Covid-19 pandemic has required us to prioritise the health and wellbeing of our staff and customers, in particular by closing all stores in the last few days. While we continue to actively engage with our stakeholders, these developments have made the task of finding a future for BrightHouse more challenging.”The company’s collapse will probably mean its 240 stores – which have been closed since last week – will disappear from the high street and leave thousands of staff unemployed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab5882c4b298aadd2add925ba7d64239a81cc212/0_187_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffe847d9fc1a25cdd165e815ca3da649","title":"china prepares to seal itself off from the world to stem imported coronavirus cases","story":"Phonecall between leaders came as China prepares to seal itself off from the world to stem ‘imported’ coronavirus casesChinese president Xi Jinping has called on Donald Trump to take “substantive actions” to improve relations between the two countries, as China prepared to shut its borders to foreign arrivals amid fears of infections coming from abroad.On Friday, Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping held a phone call about the coronavirus outbreak in an attempt to repair strained relations, following weeks of traded barbs over the virus. According to state media, Xi told Trump in a phone call on Friday that US-China relations had reached an “important juncture”.“Working together brings both sides benefits, fighting hurts both. Cooperation is the only choice,” he said. Xi said he hoped the US would take “substantive actions” to improve US-China relations to develop a relationship that is “without conflict and confrontation” but based on “mutual respect and mutually beneficial cooperation.”Trump has continued to call the disease “the Chinese virus,” despite protestations from Beijing. Chinese diplomats have in turn pushed the idea that the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, originated in the US.Xi also said he hoped the US would take “effective measures” to safeguard the lives of Chinese citizens in the US, describing the pandemic as the “common enemy of mankind.” He said: “Only by united can the international community defeat it.”After the phone call, Trump said he had a “very good conversation” with Xi. He wrote on Twitter that China had “developed a strong understanding of the virus” and was working with the US.Starting on Friday, China will temporarily bar the entry of almost all foreigners and drastically reduce flights to the country. The ban comes as the country reported its first locally infected coronavirus infection in three days and reported 54 imported cases. The move was greeted with broad support inside China.The measure applies to those with valid visas or residence permits and amounts to China shutting its borders, inviting criticism given that Beijing previously condemned other countries for similar moves. At the time, World Health Organization also advised countries not to shut their borders to Chinese travellers.In Beijing, all overseas arrivals must undergo quarantine at government-designated centres. Shanghai and other cities and provinces have implemented similarly strict rules.As China prepares to return to work and officials lift lockdowns in Hubei province, the step was greeted with support online. “I support” several wrote in comments under news of the temporary“This could not have been easy decision. I support it,” one wrote. “Foreigners should not be allowed in. Our frontline people fought so hard and foreigners are harder to regulate.”“Finally,” several others commented. “We’ve waited very long for this,” another said. Others were angry that overseas Chinese would still be allowed to return home. “Those Chinese living overseas should just not come back,” one said.The interim ban on foreigners could contribute further to diplomatic tensions as Beijing and Washington trade barbs over who is to blame for the outbreak that first emerged in central China in December before spreading to much of the rest of the world. US president Donald Trump has repeatedly called coronavirus “the Chinese virus”, prompting condemnation from Beijing.The US has now overtaken China in terms of infections, with more than 85,500 cases, compared to 81,340 in mainland China. The death toll in China was 3,292, according to health officials on Friday.Donald Trump’s instinctive response was to question other countries’ statistics. “It’s a tribute to the amount of testing that we’re doing,” Trump told reporters. “We’re doing tremendous testing, and I’m sure you’re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing. I think that’s a little hard.”In other developments in the coronavirus pandemic:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48474b0dd292449be1ab1aa9c86d33c8fd829f7/0_164_3494_2097/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7542d09677912030d129efe6197e377c","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are they and should i call the doctor","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus, how does it spread, and should you go to see a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 8,200 fatalities. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 120,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

These shortages worsened this week after a parallel government instruction to hotels to close. The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils would need extra funding if they were to meet the deadline.“These are unusual times, so I’m asking for an unusual effort,” an email from Louise Casey, who was appointed last week to lead the government’s response to Covid-19 and rough sleeping, read. “As you know, this is a public health emergency.” Casey, who also worked as Tony Blair’s homelessness tsar, said it was vital that night shelters and all street encampments be closed down, to stop the spread of the disease.Later Luke Hall, the junior housing minister, wrote a letter to the leader of every local authority in England asking them to house all people sleeping rough and to find alternative accommodation for people in hostels and night shelters by the end of the weekend, in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus.“It is now imperative that rough sleepers and other vulnerable homeless are supported into appropriate accommodation by the end of the week,” he wrote. He went on to instruct each local authority to set up a Covid-19 rough sleeping “coordination cell” and highlighted the importance of stopping homeless people from congregating in day-centre facilities to reduce the risk of transmission. There was no new funding for this request, but Hall referred council leaders to an earlier announcement of £1.6bn for local authorities’ Covid-19 response.In a significant departure from normal rules, he also stressed that people classified as having “no recourse to public funds” (a status given to people who are seeking asylum, or who have a limited immigration status), who normally have no right to housing support or benefits, should also be helped with emergency accommodation. But it was not clear how councils would fund this provision. The letter simply instructed them to “utilise alternative powers and funding to assist those with no recourse to public funds who require shelter and other forms of support due to the Covid-19 pandemic”.James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, said councils were already working hard to protect rough sleepers from becoming sick by getting them into accommodation. “To help these efforts, some councils will need to call on the government for urgent help to find accommodation and enforce this and have access to funding if they need to cover staffing and support costs,” he said.Jon Sparkes, chief executive of the homelessness charity Crisis, welcomed the government’s request, but also questioned how councils would fund the exercise. “The government’s insistence that everyone sleeping rough should be housed by the weekend is a landmark moment – and the right thing to do,” he said. “Questions remain about how local councils will be supported to do this, and whether additional funding, or assistance securing hotel rooms, will be made available. We also need to see a package of support so that, when the outbreak subsides, the outcome is not that people return to the streets.”He said the government should now make a national appeal for empty accommodation, such as apartment blocks and hotels, to be handed over to councils so that homeless people can be accommodated.Rough sleepers at Heathrow airport were told to move out on Thursday. Paul Atherton, a filmmaker who has been homeless for a number of years and who this week has been sleeping at Terminal 5, said dozens of homeless people had been told to move on, without clear instructions about where to go. He had not received assistance from Westminster council in getting housing on Friday and was pessimistic about the prospect of being accommodated. “The likelihood of anyone being housed before the weekend is infinitesimally small,” he said, suggesting that the government’s request would have been more powerful if it had ordered local councils to comply.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.Sharon Thompson, the Birmingham councillor responsible for homelessness, said she was optimistic the city’s known rough sleepers could be rehoused – 30 had been found places to live, leaving another 20 needing help. She said the task had been made more complicated by the closure of hotels that housed people in temporary accommodation and the difficulty in getting all rough sleepers to agree to go into housing. “We won’t be scooping people off the streets unless the government tells us to. We’re not looking to go down an enforcement route,” she added.The charity Praxis, which supports migrants and refugees, said it this week had helped a woman fleeing domestic violence into emergency charitable accommodation. She had been refused help by her local authority because she had no leave to remain. “No one should be left to fend for themselves during this global pandemic. This is a matter of public health as well as care for iniduals,” the CEO, Sally Daghlian, said.Jessie Seal, of Naccom, an organisation that last year helped accommodate 1,300 destitute migrants, said she was concerned by the lack of clarity over who was to fund housing people who have no recourse to public funds. “It is clear that local authorities need additional funding to support people with no recourse to public funds, and the Home Office must make policy-level changes to enable this. Without change from the Home Office, people will continue to be turned away from homelessness support services on the ground,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

We spoke to some of them about starting their careers during a pandemic.Michelle Magadada, 22, is a third year nursing student at the University of Huddersfield.My placement has been moved forward from to June to April because of coronavirus. I’m very nervous, but excited. It’ll be a learning experience for everyone, not just student nurses. None of us has dealt with a pandemic.Do I feel prepared? No, in that I don’t really know what to expect. Yes, in that I’ve dealt with situations in hospitals where we’ve had to be on high alert for deteriorating patients. We’re putting our health at risk, but this is what we do every day as nurses we come into contact with so many infections. I feel like we can tackle this by following the routines we’ve been taught.I live with another student nurse who’s more ready than I am, to be honest. He’s excited for a longer placement, and this time we’re actually being paid. My year missed out on bursaries, so it’s been difficult financially. For two years I had a part-time job as a healthcare assistant with an agency, picking up shifts when I didn’t have so many uni assignments. It was nearly impossible to manage. If it weren’t for my parents, I would have struggled. It’s nice to be part of something so huge. I understand that there are many students who are scared to take on this responsibility, but I feel like it’s a good thing that they’ve called on us. You have to be positive, or you’ll lose your head.Rebecca Lennox, 29, is a first year nursing student at John Moores University.I’m starting my work placement at a post-surgery ward soon. I’m worried because I’ve got two young children and a husband with bad asthma. Although I won’t be working directly with patients who are positive with the virus, I’ll be travelling and working in that hospital. The patients are already at risk so I think, what if I touch something in a lift or on the bus on to work and pass it to one of the patients? We have to do 2,300 theory hours and 2,300 clinical hours before we can register to become a nurse. The university says we have the choice not to go on placement now, but where am I going to make those hours up? I’m classed as a mature student, so it can feel like I’m on borrowed time. My dad has dementia and I worry about whether he’ll get to see me graduate. I’m a course representative at my university, so I hear a lot of concerns from other students. We feel like we’re in limbo. The university is trying to give assurances as to what’s going on with our hours and so on, but they just don’t know everything.I feel ready for the work. As student nurses, we go with the flow anyway because the health service is already so understaffed. Although we’re not meant to be counted in the numbers, we pretty much are all the time.Joseph Brooks, 27, is a third year nursing student at the University of Northampton.I’ll be going on placement in the next couple of weeks. The situation is obviously not great, but with the new rules allowing us to graduate early we’re clamouring to get out there and work. I’m most worried about passing the virus on to the patients. Since we’re students, we need to be supervised – but I have no idea how it’s going to work if supervisors end up contracting the virus and have to self-isolate. I imagine we’ll hear something closer to the time we’re getting updates every couple of days.I’ve heard that we will be paid while on placement during coronavirus. There’s also going to be a new grant for student nurses, but that doesn’t arrive until September. But while the grant is coming in now is welcome, it’s lower than it was, and tuition fees are still over £9,000 a year. Luckily for me, my employer (St Andrew’s Healthcare) is giving me a stipend of about £16,000 to go to university.It’s not as if the government wasn’t warned back in 2017 that they’d see a massive drop in nurses when they scrapped the bursary for student nurses – and that’s what happened. The thing with nurses is that they’re incredible people, but it seems to me that the government takes advantage of their good nature. In order to be come a nurse, you have to saddle yourself with debt. I don’t blame people who are put off by that – especially if they’re from low income backgrounds. More needs to be done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069ce448baaab601d1ef4266683da1ab5afff995/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4989e15568a8fd40586b89a5c63e4b6","title":"inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine covid 19","story":"Around the world, more than 40 teams are working on a vaccine for Covid-19. We followed one doctor in the most urgent quest of his life. By  Samanth SubramanianOf the dozens of places where a coronavirus vaccine might be born, one is DIOSynVax, a small company started by a Canadian pathologist named Jonathan Heeney. In ordinary times, I’d have visited Heeney in his office, in a stately red-brick building in Cambridge. I’d have met his team and his Aria III cytometer, which looks like as if might brew a strong, space-age espresso but which, in fact, uses its four lasers to separate cells marked with fluorescent dyes as they flow through the machine at 10,000 cells per second. I’d have tried to wangle my way into the lab designated containment level 3, the highest-but-one level of biosafety security, where Heeney’s biologists investigate pathogens such as the West Nile virus or the tuberculosis bacterium. These would be so lethal if they escaped that the lab is nearly hermetic. The joints along the walls, floor and ceiling are sealed and re-sealed the steel panels in the walls, according to government guidelines, have to be “of the type used in the nuclear industry” a flow of air must constantly be forced in if the door is open, to prevent the germs inside from drifting out. I would have even seen the coronavirus vaccine candidates themselves: samples of clear liquid, held in glass vials.But Heeney couldn’t take the risk. Understandably, he didn’t want anyone carrying Covid-19 into his lab and infecting his staff. “It’s a challenge already, because when they go home to their families every day, you don’t know who they’re passing on the bus or the train,” he said when I first spoke to him last week. At the time, Heeney was considering quarantining himself. A Cambridge college had offered him a room, so that he could shuttle between lab and bed, meeting as few people as possible. “I don’t have time to get sick,” Heeney said. He runs his company out of Cambridge University’s department of veterinary medicine, where he is a professor. He’s just a 12-minute bicycle ride from where I live, but we video-conferenced on Zoom.Since 2016, Heeney has been honing a set of methods – a platform, in vaccine parlance – that can be used to fashion vaccines that destroy whole families of viruses. Last year, he won a Gates Foundation grant of $2m (£1.6m) to fund research into a universal flu vaccine – one that will prevail against every kind of flu virus. “It’s the mother of all challenges, the holy grail,” Heeney said. In January, he kept an eye on a new disease that was flying across eastern China. After two weeks, when Chinese scientists published the coronavirus’s genetic sequence, Heeney told me his team decided: “Let’s do with this what we’re doing with the flu.”Defeating Covid-19 will call for more than vaccines it will involve quarantines, social distancing, antivirals and other drugs, and healthcare for the sick. But the idea of a vaccine – the quintessential silver bullet – has come to bear an almost unreasonable allure. The coronavirus arrived at a ripe moment in genetic technology, when the advances of the past half-decade have made it possible for vaccine projects to explode off the blocks as soon as a virus is sequenced. These cutting-edge vaccines don’t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ’s genetic code – its DNA or RNA – which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.Until this century, crafting a vaccine for even a long-familiar pathogen such as the polio virus, ushering it through trials and bringing it to market could take as long as 10 or 20 years. The first of these three stages is now staggeringly quick a scientist at one company, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, told New Scientist magazine that her team had a preliminary model for a Covid-19 vaccine after just three hours of work.The thrust of this revolution – the capacity to create an infinitesimal part of an already minute virus, without handling a virus specimen at all – can seem godlike. But the next two stages – testing vaccines in humans and then manufacturing them for wide use – remain mortally slow. This is especially so because these newest types of vaccines – DNA or RNA vaccines – have never yet been licensed for use on humans. Outside a lab, they are completely unproven. With Covid-19, both contagion and vaccine are so new that there’s no telling what human trials will reveal, or how long they will take. Every scientist, policymaker and researcher I spoke to said that we’ll be lucky to have a vaccine for use within 12-18 months.If a DNA or RNA vaccine against Covid-19 is ever approved, it will be a watershed moment – not just because it will bear out the promise of this technology, but also because the technology will fortify us against future pandemics. Over the past few years, epidemiologists, risk analysts and policymakers have made concerted efforts to sharpen research and rethink the industrial model of vaccine production, all in preparation for the hypothetical disaster they call Disease X: any unknown disease that springs suddenly into our species and races ruinously through it. Covid-19 is the first Disease X to arise since the term was invented, but it won’t be the last. The climate is warming, we’re hacking down forests, our population is expanding and our skills at waging biological warfare are improving. The odds that we’ll keep encountering more and more Disease Xs are increasing. We will need all the vaccines we can make.Heeney was spending part of his winter break with friends in Canada when he first read about an outbreak in China. “I’m a scientist,” he said. “I can’t help but follow this kind of news, even on holiday.” Back then, it seemed like a version of flu or pneumonia that might stay in Wuhan. A few days into the new year, though, the disease’s eagerness to travel became evident, and by the time Heeney rejoined his team in Cambridge, the nature of the pathogen had become clear, too. “We thought: ‘OK, this is a coronavirus. It’s going to be a tough one.’”The first time Heeney encountered coronaviruses was in 1988, as an HIV researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US. Heeney had initially trained as a vet, so his boss asked him to investigate a flurry of coronavirus cases in an unusual group of patients: a pack of cheetahs. “Some collector out in Oregon was trying to preserve the species by breeding them in a captive colony,” Heeney said. The cheetahs lost weight, their gums swelled and their livers and kidneys struggled to function. They moped about their park, depressed and ill. Later, Heeney found that the feline coronavirus had been passed to the cheetahs by a domestic cat. For the next couple of decades, Heeney remained an HIV scientist. He didn’t work much with animal viruses again until 2007, when he came to Cambridge to study diseases that spilled from animals to humans, and to develop vaccines for them.In its essence, even the most advanced vaccine functions on the same premise as the earliest mode of immunisation: cotton pads soaked in smallpox pus that were stuffed into the nostrils of healthy children in 16th-century China. The principle of vaccination is still to bluff the body: to slip in weakened germs, or even parts of germs, that do no harm but induce the release of antibodies that grant long-lasting immunity. The inducements have grown more sophisticated, but they continue to rely on the body’s biological defences. Humankind has developed no system of immune response more effective than the one that’s been inside us for hundreds of thousands of years.The latest class of vaccines – the type that Heeney works on – hold genetic material such as DNA or RNA these are the kind that have never yet been licensed for use. They can be developed quickly, and they jog our immunity in distinctly different ways from everything that came before. The oldest method of vaccination involves dosing a person with inactive or enfeebled forms of the pathogen. For most of the past century, sourcing these was a laborious affair. For decades, scientists depleted the strength of viruses by growing them in human cell strains kept in labs at low temperatures once the virus was sufficiently weak, it was safe to be sent into the human body in a vaccine. One line of lung cells, sourced from an aborted foetus in Sweden and multiplied again and again in lab cultures in the US, helped inoculate 300 million people against rubella, rabies, mumps and several other diseases.In the 1980s, researchers learned to mass-produce sub-units of a virus, each fragment assembled out of proteins and sugars. This might be a toxin or a part of the viral shell – just a signature whiff of the pathogen that can trigger immune reactions when introduced into the body. These molecular fragments are called antigens, because they generate antibodies that target them. Despite this technological advance, all these antigens still had to be cultivated in labs or factories.It wasn’t until this century that the real leap occurred, propelling scientists towards DNA and RNA vaccines of the kind that Heeney and others develop. Once computers became powerful enough to sequence the genetic code of a pathogen quickly and cheaply, scientists were able to easily create snippets of its genes, which could then be sent into the human body. These snippets, using our own cells as miniature factories, can manufacture their antigens within us. As soon as a germ’s gene sequence is known, scientists can begin concocting a vaccine for it.That’s what happened with Covid-19. On the last day of 2019, Wuhan’s health authorities reported the strange pneumonia variant to the World Health Organization. By mid-January, Chinese scientists had posted online the full, machine-readable genome of the Covid-19 virus: all 29,903 nucleic bases that comprise its sequence of RNA – ribonucleic acid, its genetic material.For scientists around the world, this was the starter pistol being fired. By studying the published genome, they could single out sets of genes that make specific proteins in the Covid-19 virus: the S-protein making up the spikes on the virus’s outer envelope, for instance, or the phosphorus-laden protein in the walls of an inner capsule, packaging the RNA within.Shortly after the coronavirus’s sequence was published, Heeney’s team set to work. The central question in their research is this: what antigens – what portions of the virus – can be found that are similar across a range of coronaviruses? If scientists discover these and, by deploying them in vaccines, drill our immune systems to recognise them, we will have given ourselves a way to fend off several kinds of coronavirus diseases, including Covid-19. The spike proteins jutting out of all these viruses, giving the appearance of a fringed crown, are a prime example of such antigens. Every coronavirus uses its spikes to invade human cells. Once our immune systems engineer antibodies in reaction to a vaccine of spike-protein antigens, they will have not just a method to identify coronaviruses, but also a prospective point of attack to cripple them.The first thing Heeney’s team did was compare the genetic sequences of the Covid-19 virus and other coronavirus strains, to figure out what structural commonalities they might use as antigens. This approach put me in mind of a captain of some medieval army, who had obtained the plans of the castles he planned to attack and was now studying them to see if they all contained the same weak drawbridges, so that he could order up a single siege engine to knock them all down.When, after a few days, they had selected their antigens – the spike protein, but also some others – the biologists in Heeney’s lab looked for their “blueprints”: the genes that direct the virus to construct each of these antigens. These lie in the gene sequences of the coronaviruses: one section of genetic code that holds the information to make a spike protein, another section for a different antigen, and so on. In late January, the lab sent these sections of code electronically to a German company, which built them out into synthetic genes – made artificially, but otherwise consisting of the same sugars and other material as our own DNA.These minuscule lengths of DNA were sent back to Cambridge suspended in vials of colourless, viscous fluid. In any eventual human trials, this DNA will be injected into the body to do what it’s meant to do: construct antigens to prod the immune system into action. This is all meticulous, elaborate work, but the power of modern computing can hurry it along at astonishing speed. By the first week of February, Heeney said, his scientists were carrying out trials in mice.In all of this, no one in Heeney’s team handled the coronavirus itself in fact, until the synthetic DNA arrived from Germany, most of their work was on computers. This would have been unimaginable for earlier generations of vaccine scientists, who took in full-strength pathogens and then, with immense care, whittled down their potency. Heeney longed to know, first-hand, how the virus behaves in cells and what kinds of antibodies respond to it. For weeks, he said, “no one outside China had isolated the virus”. Then, towards the end of January, scientists at the University of Melbourne announced that they’d grown cultures of the virus.Braving the uncertainties of travel, Heeney flew via Thailand to Australia, arriving in time for the first inoculation of a mouse with the cultured virus on 19 February. “I wanted to establish some collaborations with these teams. They’ll be important for us down the line,” Heeney told me. In a bygone time, he might have brought back a vial of virus with him. “When I was a youngster, people would just put samples in their briefcases, or in the breast pockets of their coats. But the biosecurity protocols are intense now, so you can’t do that any more.”Unlike Heeney’s project, which takes on a whole family of viruses, most vaccine projects are targeting just the virus causing Covid-19, but they follow the same basic, still-experimental approach: synthesise DNA or RNA, tuck that genetic material into a vaccine and have it build antigens once it’s shot into the body. (I found only a couple of projects that are working the older way, using a weakened form of the whole virus in a vaccine.) Heeney is fully aware that these DNA and RNA vaccines may all still collapse in trials. “There are graveyards full of failed viral vaccine candidates,” he said. But if even one succeeds, “then we’ll be entering a brave new world of vaccines”.To an outsider, the design of a DNA or RNA vaccine in a lab seems like cool, ordered science, conducted by computers, technicians in sterile oversuits, and machines that hum quietly. The next stage – when the vaccine has to negotiate clinical trials – is rife with all the messy uncertainties of human biology. In other words, while genetic technology has dramatically shrunk the first leg of the process from years to weeks, the second leg remains as long as ever, so that vaccine development now resembles a pair of misshapen trousers.In the literature, past mishaps flash like red warning signals. In 1942, a yellow fever vaccine contaminated with a hepatitis B virus was given to more than 300,000 American troops nearly 150 of them died. The field’s classic reference text, Plotkin’s Vaccines, by the physician Stanley Plotkin, refers sombrely to “the Cutter incident” – a 1955 episode in which a manufacturer named Cutter Laboratories failed to properly deactivate the virus in its polio shot. The faulty vaccine caused roughly 40,000 cases of polio, paralysed 260 people and killed 10.The US’s strict rules to regulate vaccines emerged, in part, because of Cutter Laboratories. The company survived, but paid out millions in civil damages. The Cutter incident set a precedent for more lawsuits during the next three decades, in which parents argued that their children had been disabled by malfunctioning vaccines. Some pharma firms, worried about multimillion-dollar claims settlements, abandoned vaccines altogether others hiked their prices to cover any future legal costs. To keep vaccines cheap and vaccinations regular, the US government had to set up a compensation fund that eased most of the liability on vaccine companies.In the midst of a pandemic, so many forces tug at the vaccine development process – politics, industry, science, money, fear, hope – that there’s a perpetual hazard of clinical trials being hurried or of a poorly planned vaccination scheme being rushed out. One historical analogue is found in 1976 – like 2020, an election year. That February, a bout of swine flu broke out in an army post in New Jersey, and one soldier died. In comparison to Covid-19, the outbreak now seems minor, but it jolted President Ford’s government, which was already suffering from the second-hand shame of Nixon’s resignation just two years earlier. The administration fretted that, in the autumn, at the height of flu season, the virus would exact a huge loss of life one government estimate figured that 1 million Americans would die.So Ford announced a plan to vaccinate everyone in the country, and had the Centers for Disease Control draft a $136m plan to do it. He ignored Albert Sabin, one of the heroes of the polio vaccine, who advised against immunisation, believing that no epidemic was imminent. Ford also ignored the warnings coming out of clinical trials, in which one of the four manufacturers was found to have formulated some unknown number of its 2.6m doses with a different flu virus altogether. Congress exempted all these companies from liabilities if their vaccine harmed anyone. Beginning in October, 40 million Americans were vaccinated, but by mid-December, it emerged that the shot came with a slightly increased risk of contracting Guillain–Barré syndrome, an immobilising neurological condition.The vaccine campaign was scrapped soon after by that time, close to 450 people had been afflicted with Guillain–Barré. It was impossible to say how many of these cases were seeded by the vaccine. And if the vaccine really did prevent a swine flu epidemic, there was no way to know the counterfactual – no vaccination, a ravaging pandemic – was hidden from view. This vaccine’s legacy, in public memory, was the paralysis of those hundreds of people.Already, the temptation to accelerate the trials of Covid-19 vaccines is becoming apparent. Earlier this month, Donald Trump suggested using “a solid flu vaccine … on corona”. Not possible, scientists informed him. When he declared that a vaccine would be available within a few months, he had to be told that, in that time, vaccines would only be ready for testing. Ordinarily, human trials come after many phases of animal testing, but at least two companies – one of them Moderna – have decided to do both in parallel. The scientists I spoke to, though, kept telling me that testing couldn’t be rushed. “There will be many trials, and we need to be ready for some failures,” Heeney said. He leaned in towards his webcam as if to push his point physically through the internet to me. “We have to avoid overpromising, because if there’s an accident with one of those first vaccines – if someone gets ill and it gets into the Daily Mail, ‘New vaccine threatens survival’ or some ridiculous headline – then people won’t want to take even the later vaccines that do work. It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking here.”Among the peculiarities of this pandemic, moreover, is the fact that we, the general populace, might determine how well human trials go. If huge swathes of society become infected before the vaccine is ready to test on humans, the trials will be difficult to conduct, said Sarah Gilbert, an immunologist at the University of Oxford’s Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research. Gilbert’s team also has a vaccine candidate for Covid-19, based on an earlier vaccine it had devised for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or Mers, another coronavirus disease. In mid-March, Gilbert had to put an auto-response on her email. When her team was ready to recruit subjects for vaccine trials, it would be advertised on the website, she wrote. “Please do not contact me about volunteering.”Gilbert’s worry is that, at the peak of infection, the virus will be bouncing so frantically around the population that “you can’t screen your volunteers. By the time you get their results back, they may have been exposed.” Organising trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have cultivated a natural immunity by then. Transmission will have dropped as well, Gilbert said – it’s hard to know how well a vaccine trial is going if the subjects aren’t being exposed to the virus at all. “This is herd immunity – good for the population, but it makes testing a vaccine more difficult,” she explained.The best possible scenario involves delaying the pandemic’s peak – pushing it through the summer towards August, to buy scientists a few extra months to run their trials. “So we’d really be pleased,” Gilbert said sternly, “if everyone will just do what they’re being told and stay at home.”At some point in March, Heeney’s sense of time started to grow muddled. Things happened so fast, and his weeks were so full, that dates lost their meaning once, while speaking to me, he had to thumb back through his email to recollect even roughly when a particular step in his research had happened. “The coronavirus dominates our days,” he said. He wakes before dawn to pore through feeds of scientific data and journal articles. “There are conference calls, there’s all this paperwork to fill out so we can deal safely with pathogens, there’s the need to scale up the lab to work on the vaccine. There’s just no routine anymore. It feels like the wild west right now.”Like every other scientist, Heeney spends part of his days worrying about funding. All these vaccine projects hurtling towards trials may yet be drawn to a screeching halt by a lack of money. Trials are expensive so is the outlay on manufacturing and marketing vaccines. “If you’re going to make enough doses for the whole world, you’re going to need billions and billions of dollars,” Heeney said. Earlier this week, the Wellcome Trust put an exact number on it: a further $3bn, across the industry, to fund and produce enough vaccines to beat the pandemic.Most of this money will go towards trials and production, the costs of which are now frequently borne by drug companies. After the 80s, when a series of mergers left the pharma industry in the hands of a few behemoth companies, vaccines fell thoroughly under the sway of market forces, subject to the kind of logic that prompted Goldman Sachs, in a 2018 report, to wonder: “Is curing patients a sustainable business model?” (It isn’t, the analysts concluded.)Diseases that are borne out of poverty, and that require cheap vaccines, such as cholera, are largely ignored, says Peter Jay Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So are diseases that are uncommon, or diseases that have come and gone. Taxpayers fund most vaccine research, but the pharma titans that can make them at scale are reluctant to commit to a vaccine if the likelihood of profit is meagre. “We have a broken ecosystem for making vaccines,” Hotez told me.If the business wasn’t set up this way, Hotez thinks, he’d have a Covid-19 vaccine to offer, based on an earlier project that wilted from lack of funding. The story of Hotez’s vaccine is a parable for this field, and it foretells one highly possible future for all the exciting vaccine work currently underway against Covid-19.When Sars broke out in 2002, scientists and companies rolled up their sleeves to deliver a vaccine. But after 2004, no Sars cases were reported, so research flagged one vaccine, from Sanofi, never made it past clinical trials. Ideally, Hotez says, vaccines would still have been run through the first few steps of trials and kept in reserve for future emergencies. Between 2011 and 2016, Hotez and his team designed a potential vaccine for Sars, and had the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research make 20,000 doses, to test on humans. But none of Hotez’s usual funders gave him a grant for these trials. “Sars dropped off their list of priorities,” Maria Elena Bottazzi, one of Hotez’s collaborators at Baylor, told me. “We had other situations, like Ebola or Zika.” The industry’s attention is easily erted, Hotez said. “It’s like little kids playing a football game. The ball goes in one direction and all the kids run after it. Then it goes in another direction and all the kids run that way.”So much about Covid-19 is still unclear that companies can’t yet gauge the profit margins on a vaccine. Will the disease fade before a vaccine is approved? Will DNA or RNA vaccines even work? Will everyone be inoculated – a bumper payday from billions of doses – or will vaccines go to just a few at-risk groups, such as healthcare workers or anyone over 40? “At some point, there will be a gono-go decision to make for companies,” said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine policy scholar at Yale. “And then they’ll have to figure out if it’s worth the risk.” One way to make it worthwhile is to engage in price gouging, which drug companies have always been happy to do. Earlier this month, the US passed a coronavirus spending bill that deliberately left out controls on vaccine prices.At the same time, pharma companies are indispensable, said Charlie Weller, who heads the vaccines programme at the Wellcome Trust. (When Weller spoke to me one evening on the phone, she had to break off for a minute to comfort her little daughter, who’d burst into tears after learning that, as the child of a key worker, she’d have to keep going to school even while her friends stayed home.) Pharma firms pay for most clinical trials, invest in experts and equipment, and bring drugs to market. They assume the right to set prices and decide what vaccines to sell because they claim to bear the most financial risk. “If we have to be ready for more Disease Xs, we need to rethink this whole underlying structure,” Weller told me. “We have to do it so that the risk is shared.”Two years ago, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) was founded to do just this: to allay some of the financial risk of research, and to keep this research going even in the troughs between epidemics. Cepi’s funding – about $740m – comes from a combination of philanthropists and governments. Melanie Saville, its director of vaccine development, told me that they were funding eight ongoing Covid-19 vaccine projects. But Cepi’s own money for Covid-19 was going to run out by the end of March. Without more donations, none of its funded vaccines would progress beyond the first phase of clinical trials.One of Cepi’s ambitions is to create its own “investigational stockpile” of vaccines – vaccines that have passed the first two out of three stages of clinical trials, and that then bide their time in cold storage. Everyone hopes they will never be required, but if necessary, they can be brought forth, hustled through the final clinical trial stage – which must be conducted in a real outbreak – and launched into production. Saville said Cepi has no storage or clinical facilities of its own, and that the stockpiles would reside inidually with manufacturers. This disappointed me for a second, I’d dreamed of a vaccine storehouse nestled somewhere in the Arctic – a Svalbard against sickness, a vault so titanic that it dwarfed the germs it intended to fight by zillions of orders of magnitude.A week after I met Heeney on Zoom, I called him again. He gave me a phone number in his Cambridge college he had decided to self-quarantine himself in a room after all. “It’s not like I’ve been at risk, but if one of us goes down, we all go down like dominoes,” he said. He was full of praise for his team – “all these bright, talented iniduals who are still living at home but are otherwise trying to live isolated lives, like monks in a monastery”. When Heeney moved into his room, he wiped down all the surfaces. One day, he went to get a cup of coffee, and when he came back to his room, he saw that two men had come in to change the batteries in the fire alarm. “It was crazy. I thought: ‘Here I am trying to keep the risk factor low. Does this have to happen now?’”His lab is still running trials in mice. It’s a long process, he said. “You take tissue cultures from the mice and you study them. We’re getting all this data, so that we can see what works and what doesn’t.” It’s too early to tell which of the vaccine projects out there will succeed, he said. “You know, I think it’s pretty amazing that humans have got vaccines in trials already,” Heeney said. “The trials will tell us what we need to know. My worry is that the devil is in the details with this coronavirus. But I hope I’m wrong. I really hope I’m wrong.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9de242ba20d36bd18694b4a7b8e1aaa9367ef4e7/0_6_6046_3629/master/6046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2355e3ec35f80480a36072a544ef8b80","title":"mothers say they being kept at work uk as fathers stay home","story":"Charities hit out at firms’ unequal coronavirus stance as pregnant women also lose outMothers with school-age children are being told they cannot work from home during the coronavirus pandemic, while fathers at the same companies are encouraged to do so, according to organisations providing legal advice and support for parents.Legal advice lines have also been inundated with calls from pregnant women who have been made redundant while male workers have been kept on, and others who have been told they must go to work or face the sack despite being categorised as a vulnerable group in government guidance.“We are seeing parents, the overwhelming majority of them mothers, getting in touch to say their employers are not letting them work from home because schools have closed, and in some instances their male colleagues have been allowed to do so,” said Julia Waltham, the joint head of policy and influencing at the charity Working Families. “Too often it is women who are expected to take up the slack at home and many mothers are feeling very vulnerable about work at the moment.”Anna (not her real name) said her pay had been cut and hours reduced since the crisis struck. “I’m constantly being advised to reduce my hours as I can’t possibly manage two kids and my job at home,” she said. “It’s only the women that get asked on calls how they are managing – the men with childcare are fine to work as normal.”People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.The charity, which has detailed advice for parents, praised action already taken to protect workers but called for clear messaging that employers should be as flexible as possible and staff should not be automatically furloughed. “If employers make wholesale decisions to ‘furlough’ one working parent in each working family, all the evidence suggests that it is overwhelmingly working mothers who will be put in this position,” the letter says.Joeli Brearley, the founder of the Pregnant Then Screwed campaign, said hundreds of pregnant women and mothers had called for advice and support since UK schools closed on 20 March, leaving millions of families juggling childcare and work commitments.“Yet again it is women scooping up the unpaid labour to keep things ticking over during a crisis,” she said. “We are seeing companies telling staff to work from home but denying women with kids that possibility, and we’re seeing pregnant women laid off without any sort of process while others are told they have to come into work.”Sarah (not her real name), who is pregnant and works in a call centre that arranges hire cars, was told she had to continue working as the firm’s staff have been classified as key workers and cannot work from home. She was advised that if she followed government guidelines and self-isolated for 12 weeks the company could not guarantee her pay.Pregnant women taking sick pay in order to self-isolate could also find they are not eligible for statutory maternity pay (SMP), which is calculated on the amount they get paid in the two months before the end of the 15th week before the baby is due. Claire, who works in customer service for a car insurance company, said she was not allowed to work from home even though she was 22 weeks pregnant, in the SMP qualifying period, and most of her colleagues were working remotely. “My family is putting pressure on me to stay home and not put myself or the baby at risk. I’m so stressed I don’t know what to do,” she said.“Many of the women we have spoken to, particularly single parents, are telling us they suddenly have no income, no way of paying their rent or buying food for their kids,” Brearley said. “It’s a horrible situation, and it’s been really stressful being at the coalface of that without any clear advice from the government to give.”Women’s rights groups have warned that the current gender-blind response to the coronavirus crisis risks setting gender equality back years, and called for the needs of women to be factored into policymaking. This week more than 50 organisations signed a statement calling on the government to consider the specific challenges faced by women, while women’s organisations are gathering data on how the crisis is affecting women specifically.Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said women were more likely to be on the frontline delivering essential services, in low-paid and insecure work and caring for children and older relatives, as well as significantly more likely to be put at risk of self-isolating with an abusive partner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bb10419967e81ef104781d39d79f1c9c5b6064d/22_0_3457_2075/master/3457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dff77bacb567b342602c1b6687cf6f02","title":"posturing and point scoring leave un hamstrung against coronavirus","story":"The security council is struggling to function as the US defies secretary general’s advice and Russia probes for political gainIn the face of a truly global crisis, the world’s highest deliberative body, the UN security council, has been paralysed by squabbling among the major powers.The 15-member council has not even been able to muster a joint statement on combating the spread of the coronavirus – in part because of US insistence that it should stress the Chinese origins of the pathogen, which was unacceptable to other states, not least China.A draft statement would have echoed the calls from the UN secretary general, António Guterres, for a global ceasefire in view of the pandemic.The US has also ignored Guterres’ calls for sanctions to be suspended on vulnerable countries. Over the past week, Washington has intensified punitive action against Iran and Venezuela. At the same time, Russia has blocked an attempt to hold virtual security council sessions by video conference.“In the current circumstances, it is important to show to the rest of the world that UN and its security council are functioning,” the Russian ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, wrote to his Chinese counterpart, who had proposed video conferences.The letter was first reported by Foreign Policy. The Russians have allowed some video conferences to go ahead but have insisted they be counted as informal consultations rather than formal sessions.“We shouldn’t be afraid to gather from time to time in the UNSC chamber. After all the preventive measures taken by the secretary general, the UN is one of the safest venues in NYC, and the risk of getting the virus there is much lower than when we go to a shop for basic needs,” Nebenzia argued.Other council members did not share his assessment of the health risks, and were suspicious of Russian motives.“I thought, initially, it was a Russian macho thing – and it may have been at first – but it looks like it might be tactical,” one security council diplomat said. “They like being on the security council, but they don’t like being called to account for their behaviour in Syria, Libya, Central African Republic, etc. So they’ll enjoy the break.”The UN’s general assembly can step in where the security council has failed, and is currently considering a resolution to uphold the organisation’s central role in fighting the pandemic and to ensure that “there is no place for any form of discrimination, racism and xenophobia in the response to the pandemic”.But some diplomats voiced concern that if the security council becomes less visible at the height of the pandemic, it will lose its centrality as an arena in which the world’s most powerful governments are held to account.“If there aren’t meetings on things like Syria now, it makes it easier for them not to happen and easier to make the UNSC a less important global meeting once we come back,” said the security council diplomat, who suggested that could be Russia’s long-term aim. “I think they’ll see if they can reshape the world order to their benefit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74879789f3f89076f2a2d94012597817a6f070d5/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c625535a65ee0307e96bb56b1759420f","title":"practical tips physical distancing shopping lockdown coronavirus supplies","story":"Buying essential supplies can be tricky during the coronavirus lockdown. Here’s how to navigate the new rulesWith lockdown conditions imposed in many countries to try to prevent the spread of coronavirus, everyday activities such as shopping are going to be different from usual for some time.Here are some tips on how to practise physical distancing while purchasing essential food and medical supplies.Keep clear of people on the way to and from the shops, and when inside them as well, if possible. Be patient and take your turn to access goods in fridges and freezers. Some supermarkets are helping to do this by limiting the number of people who can be inside a shop at any given time. When purchasing your shopping, try to keep your distance from shop workers as well. With self-service checkouts and pin pads, you may have no choice but to come into contact with surfaces that have been handled by many people. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth until you have washed your hands. Some stores are providing hand sanitiser, and cleaning shopping trolleys and baskets between customers.Clearly there will be exceptions: for example, single parents with small children who cannot be left at home, but where possible you should try to shop alone. That will reduce the number of people inside stores, making physical distancing easier to achieve. It also reduces the number of people in your household exposed to the outdoors. Remember: studies show that, on average, people can have coronavirus for five days before they develop any symptoms, and all that time they can be unwittingly spreading it.It is natural that people worried about potentially being stuck indoors self-isolating for 14 days want to stock up on supplies. However, panic-buying means there can be shortages of food and medical products for people who rely on them. And there are reports of increased food waste as people have stockpiled perishable goods that they could not possibly have consumed in time. If everybody buys only what they need, there will be enough for all.Many shops including supermarkets are setting aside certain hours of the week specifically for shopping to be carried out by key workers, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions that mean they are trying to shield themselves from exposure to the virus. Clearly, it is difficult to enforce this, but be considerate when you choose to visit the shops to avoid coming into contact with these groups.The fewer people on the streets and in shops, the less chance there is for people to pass on coronavirus. If you can get delivery services, this will reduce the amount of times you have to leave the house. This will help slow, and ease, the peak of infections in the population that politicians and scientists worry will overwhelm health services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6acb96d05b0c8da72a15aa5676dc158bd4417e44/0_80_4692_2814/master/4692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03d3b46ab37e1b9c97c1355d97874b99","title":"stay home varadkar urges irish in drastic lockdown","story":"Irish taoiseach says new measures aimed at ‘saving as many people’s lives as possible’The Irish government has announced sweeping restrictions that will put Ireland in a de facto lockdown to try to slow the spread of coronavirus.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that from midnight people should stay at home for two weeks, until 12 April, in a significant tightening of curbs on social and commercial life.People will be allowed to leave home to shop for food and exercise briefly within 2km of their homes, he said in a televised address from Government Buildings in Dublin.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.All public or private gatherings are banned, as are visits to hospitals and prisons, with some exceptions on compassionate grounds. People aged over 70 and vulnerable groups must “cocoon”, and travel to offshore islands will be limited to residents.There are concessions for farming, travel to and from essential work that cannot be done from home, caring for elderly or vulnerable people, and collecting medicine and attending medical appointments.“I’m appealing to every man, woman and child to make these sacrifices for the love of each other ... show that you care for your family and friends: stay home,” said Varadkar.He declined to use the term lockdown but said the measures were drastic. “There isn’t much more we could do beyond this to restrict movement. These are radical actions aimed at saving as many people’s lives as possible in the days and weeks ahead.”The measures broadly align Ireland with the UK and tighten a gradual shutdown that began with closures of schools and universities on 13 March and widened to include most businesses and a ban on sporting events.“Our country is rising to this challenge, and I’m convinced we will prevail,” said Varadkar.Earlier on Friday health authorities announced the pandemic had claimed three more lives – including that of a health worker – bringing Ireland’s death toll to 22. Another 302 cases were confirmed, bringing the total number of infections to 2,121.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.That total is lower than authorities had predicted for this phase but there is deep concern that intensive care units are already nearing capacity and could be overwhelmed.Tony Holohan, the chief medical officer, said day-on-day increases have slowed, suggesting restrictions are working, but added that this did not mean the worst was over. “It tells us we are having early impact. We think now is the time for us to move, to try and spend two weeks to really suppress this virus as much as is possible in the community.”The president, Michael D Higgins, signed into law an emergency measures bill that gives the government extensive powers to combat the pandemic and cushion the economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfab7e160a506bdf7cdb9880908ace6382ee20c0/0_0_3318_1990/master/3318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84bea2c6a02fad000ef7d74375e53da4","title":"stranded at sea cruise ships around the world are adrift as ports turn them away","story":"A  analysis finds that at least 10 ships remain at sea – and four passengers have died while being strandedPorts around the globe are turning cruise ships away en masse amid the coronavirus pandemic, leaving thousands of passengers stranded even as some make desperate pleas for help while sickness spreads aboard.Four passengers have died aboard one such vessel, the Holland America cruise ship Zaandam, which has been stranded for days after Chile refused to allow the ship to dock in its original destination of San Antonio on 21 March.The Zaandam is one of at least 10 ships around the world – carrying nearly 10,000 passengers – still stuck at sea after having been turned away from their destination ports in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a  analysis. Some of the ships are facing increasingly desperate medical situations.Holland America announced Friday that four elderly passengers had died and two others had tested positive for coronavirus, with 138 additional cases of respiratory illness on board further tests are still being conducted among its 1,243 guests and 586 crew. The Zaandam is carrying hundreds of American, Canadian, Australian and British passengers, and is currently off the coast of Ecuador and seeking permission to dock in Florida.The ship is steaming up the coast of South America, hoping to make it through the Panama Canal and on to the US. But the Florida port, where many of the passengers had planned to disembark on the final leg of the cruise, has refused to confirm that the ship can dock.While the Zaandam and at least two other ships still carrying passengers at sea have reported outbreaks of coronavirus-like respiratory illness onboard, other ships are being turned away from docking and unloading their passengers even with no signs of illness at all.Dramatic scenes of coronavirus-stricken cruises, such as the Grand Princess in California and the Diamond Princess in Japan, have become synonymous with the pandemic. The plight of those still adrift highlights how cruise ships have become a kind of pariah of the seas, with cities wary of becoming the next home for a potentially infected vessel.On the Zaandam, which was headed northeast along the coast of Ecuador on Thursday, anxiety was growing.Passengers who spoke with the  describe being locked down in the cabins, with three daily meals left on the floor outside their doors. Meanwhile the number of people reporting influenza-like symptoms has almost tripled this week: 56 passengers and 89 crew members, passengers say the ship’s captain has told them. Four elderly passengers reportedly required oxygen.But on Tuesday a port commission in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, delayed approving the Zaandam’s request, with some commissioners arguing the ship should be turned away because it didn’t originate in Florida, and others calling the situation a humanitarian crisis and saying the passengers should be allowed to disembark, according to the Miami Herald.Amid the confusion, passengers began an online lobbying campaign to convince Florida officials to allow the boat to dock. “I am a US citizen and longtime Florida resident who is stranded at sea off the coast of South America,” wrote passenger Laura Gabaroni Huergo on Facebook on Wednesday. “Some (Florida) county officials are trying to turn us away and abandon us at sea to fend for ourselves. We need help getting a plan together to dock and return to our lives.”Holland America said this week it had dispatched support in the form of another cruise ship, the Rotterdam, carrying 611 extra staff, supplies and coronavirus test kits to meet up with the stricken ship.The company announced Friday that it plans to offload healthy passengers to the Rotterdam, while keeping ill passengers and those who have been exposed to them aboard the Zaandam.“Priority for the first guests to transfer will be given to those on Zaandam with inside staterooms and who are over 70,” said the statement from Holland America. “Once aboard Rotterdam, all guests will continue to remain in their staterooms until disembarkation. Any guests who are currently ill, or in isolation as a close contact, and all crew will remain on Zaandam.”The company’s statement said there are now four doctors and four nurses aboard the Zaandam and two doctors and four nurses on the Rotterdam.As the Rotterdam pulled alongside the Zaandam in darkness Thursday night, passengers exchanged photos and cheered each other on a Facebook group created for the ship.“I would have rather had a helicopter, but beggars can’t be choosers,” said one.As of Thursday, the  had identified five ships in the Americas that were unable to unload nearly 6,000 passengers. At least three other ships were having trouble off the coast of Australia, including one which sought urgent medical attention for an outbreak of respiratory illness. Two more ships were trying to get passengers to ports in Italy.Lori Bessler, a southern California resident whose parents are stuck onboard the Coral Princess, another boat stranded off the coast of Brazil with no reported illness onboard, says she is nonetheless concerned for her family’s health and wellbeing. “My mom and stepdad are diabetics and … we’re very concerned about them having enough medication to sustain them,” she told the .The Coral Princess was due to dock in Buenos Aires on 18 March but is now headed for Florida. So far the cruise ship has only been allowed to disembark passengers from South America more than a thousand US, Canadian and British citizens, including Bessler’s parents, remain on the ship.Bessler said she has struggled to get information from either the cruise company or from US government officials. She worries that Florida may become overrun by Covid-19 cases by the time the ship arrives there in two weeks.“It’s a scary situation,” said Bessler, who has been texting with her mom many times a day. “I think they need to be rescued and brought to their homes.”The fast-moving nature of the virus has added to the confusion – when many passengers left for vacations in early March there were no cases of Covid-19 in South America, so they thought it would be safe to travel.But Ross Klein, a professor at St John’s College in Newfoundland who has written four books on the cruise industry, said companies should have acted weeks earlier to cancel trips and refund customers. He noted that cases of cruise ships being turned away from ports as a result of coronavirus fears began as early as January and escalated in February, with passengers being quarantined on the Emerald Princess in Japan on 3 February.“There is a level of greed on the part of these companies,” he said. “They want to make every penny – and they make money when people are on the ships.”Cruise ships are drawing increasing government scrutiny for not doing enough to protect their passengers during this pandemic. In Florida, the attorney general’s office is investigating potentially misleading sales practices, after the Miami New Times obtained leaked emails showing representatives for Norwegian Cruise Lines may have downplayed the coronavirus in sales pitches to passengers, even as the pandemic was disrupting trips. “The Coronavirus can only survive in cold temperatures, so the Caribbean is a fantastic choice for your next cruise,” said one sales script obtained by the paper.Despite Donald Trump’s repeated vows to bail out the cruise ship industry, money for cruise companies was not a part of the $500bn in aid for large employers included in stimulus bill passed by Congress on Wednesday.Most of the major cruise operators register their companies in countries such as Panama and Liberia, thereby avoiding most US taxes and labor laws. Thus, the cruise industry’s trade group said on Thursday the companies will not have access to the US aid for large employers, according to the Washington Post.Meanwhile a report from the US Centers for Disease Control this week laid the blame on cruise ships for spreading the virus in the crucial early weeks of the outbreak, linking hundreds of cases to the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess.“Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of their closed environment, contact between travelers from many countries, and crew transfers between ships,” the CDC report concluded.Back aboard the Zaandam, passengers are passing the time however they can. Some chat with other cabins on a Facebook group, others enjoy the free liquor, snap pictures of brown boobies flying outside their windows, or partake in meditation, yoga classes and a daily quiz offered via the ship’s TV. Passengers joke the top quiz prize should be extra face masks or toilet paper, or a chance to get outside and do laps around the promenade deck.But despite moments of levity, the situation is bleak.“I’m safe and healthy right now. Staying confined in my cabin except for the strange ritual of eating meals in the crew mess while maintaining a safe distance from each other,” he wrote on Monday. “I won’t lie: things are looking grim here and I just want to go home. We all do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb6769976a80b599c5af2d47f19250ad6447b53/0_199_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a46393ac51450fd73e04825ee3456e3d","title":"uk urged to help stranded brits covid 19 pandemic pakistan nepal","story":"Hundreds of citizens are stuck in countries including Nepal and Pakistan, lacking consular support A cross-party group of more than 60 MPs has urged the government to arrange charter flights to bring home British nationals stranded abroad as further stories of people stuck in dire circumstances emerged.Hundreds of vulnerable British citizens are stranded in Pakistan with many of them running short of the vital medication they need to treat serious health conditions.Accounts also emerged from Nepal, where hundreds of British tourists are stuck, some high up in the mountains with no way of getting back to the towns and home.British nationals have complained of receiving little to no consular support and say there is a lack of clear advice from the Foreign Office. The cost of commercial flights has skyrocketed.Among the British people stranded in Lahore, Pakistan, is 60-year-old Tanweer Ahmed Khan from Manchester, alongside six members of his family.Khan’s daughter, Ikra Naser, said her party, aged four to 65, had been due to fly back to the UK on Friday after visiting a sick relative but they had been stranded.Naser said: “My father has a severe heart condition and severe arthritis. He took enough medication to last until Monday but then we don’t know what he’ll do. My mum also suffers health conditions and she must travel with my dad to look after him, given how strong his meds are.”The outward flights cost £500 each for a return but the family is facing paying up to £2,000 for a single trip back – if they can even find one to take. Khan said she had spent many hours contacting the FCO. “But they don’t seem to care. I’m scared for my parents.”Another Briton, Adnan Aftab from Birmingham, said he was with his mother who had underlying health issues.Sahiba Sajid, an NHS hospital social worker from Leeds who is stranded in Pakistan, said: “I’m frustrated that I’m not able to return. The team I work in was already under a lot of pressure before I went abroad and I can only imagine how they are managing. I just want to go back and work but I’m stuck here instead.”Afzal Khan, the MP for Manchester Gorton, said a significant number of British nationals were stuck in Pakistan.Khan said: “I have been contacted by a number of constituents who are growing increasingly anxious about being unable to return home to the UK. Many have serious underlying health conditions and are running low on essential medication which is only adding to their anxieties. We are calling on the government to do more to bring British citizens home to safety.”Julie McElhinney and Dave Wong, from London, were in the Nepalese mountains when it was announced that flights were to stop. “We struggled to find things in English to understand what was going on,” said McElhinney.They managed to get to Kathmandu but information was still scarce. “We were gleaning information from fellow travellers and locals, basically trying to work on rumours,” McElhinney said.“We and others have used family to phone the Foreign Office, the embassy and airlines but mostly just had generic information that they are working on it. There’s a lot of frustration that communications has not been good. We’ve managed to reschedule flights for 4 April but we don’t know if it will happen. The challenge for everyone is not knowing.“We feel apprehensive about what could happen in the coming weeks. There is uncertainty about food, accommodation, flights. A large number of locals have fled Kathmandu for their villages so a lot of things aren’t open. Our Nepalese hosts have been trying their best to get us food and look after us but there’s a lot of fear here about the poor medical facilities if Covid-19 was to take hold.”Wong said: “The main issue is the lack of transparency, action and progress from the British embassy when compared to our European neighbours.“Further up in the mountains there are people worse off than us and are worried about how they are going to get home. They’ve spent all their money on multiple airline tickets and are struggling to get refunds.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6371354c3458869a0c36e89ecc13d6a77b7ebcc1/0_194_818_491/master/818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9928c3c45cdd331a2f75657779c4f12","title":"utrecht rooftops greened plants mosses vertical forest","story":"‘Vertical forest’ tower will have 10,000 plants on its facade in bid to reinvigorate bioersityEvery roof in the city district of Utrecht is to be “greened” with plants and mosses or have solar panels installed under plans driven by the success of a similar scheme for the municipality’s bus stops.The “no roofs unused” policy is part of an attempt to reinvigorate bioersity in the city and create a less stressful and happier environment, of which the construction of a so-called “vertical forest tower with 10,000 plants on its facade is set to become a leading example.That building alone, close to Utrecht railway station, will host 360 trees and 9,640 shrubs and flowers, equal to 1 hectare (2.47 acres) of woods, once it is completed in 2022.Alderman Kees Diepeveen said: “In this city district every roof will be either used for green or for solar panels. It will be that when you look at the different heights, the lower rooftops will be mainly green and the higher ones will be mainly solar panels. And now again a combination of the two because solar panels need some cooling.“The green can offer the cooling for the solar panels to function properly. It will be a regulation: all roofs are used.”Utrecht, the fastest growing city in the Netherlands, was rated in a 2019 study by Natuur \u0026amp Milieu as the most “sustainable” in the country in terms of buying green electricity, its use of environmental zones, exploitation of solar power and encouragement of cycling.The municipality completed the installation of green roofs on its 316 bus stops last year, capturing fine particles of air pollution, storing rainwater, and providing cooling during the summer months.The bus stops roofs are planted with sedum, a plant with small yellow flowers in the summer months, draws birds, bees and butterflies. The bus stops, fitted with bamboo benches, feature energy-efficient LED lighting and 96 of them have been outfitted with solar panels.The bases of the shelters are made of recycled concrete and the municipality says the maintenance will be carried out solely by electric vehicles. The city, the fourth largest in the Netherlands, plans to use “completely clean public transport” by 2028 with the electricity used to power the buses being produced by Dutch windmills.The 300ft-high Utrecht vertical forest, a landmark building in the newly greened city centre, will comprise 200 apartments. Its facade, roof and balconies will be filled with around half the trees and shrubs presently found in Central Park in New York.Its developers claim it will absorb about 5.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year and produce about 41 tonnes of oxygen, equivalent to that generated by a hectare of forest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0c584e4c6a8757e92bea1fb13b7e4d71","title":"very scary pleas for safe harbour from stranded cruise ship near panama","story":"Two people have tested positive for coronavirus and four have died on the Zaandam luxury cruise linerPassengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama have issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a covid-19 outbreak on board.Two people have tested positive for the disease and dozens are ill with flu-like symptoms on the Zaandam luxury cruise liner, which has not been able to dock after several Latin American countries closed their ports in response to the global pandemic.Hundreds of North American, Australian and British citizens are in isolation in their rooms and a boat-to-boat operation is underway to move some healthy travellers to a sister ship, the Rotterdam, over the weekend.But there are fears that sick, elderly passengers and crew members will be left stranded at sea during a global pandemic, with some on board isolating in small, humid cabins with no natural light or fresh air.Holland America Line, which owns the cruise ship, confirmed on Friday that four elderly passengers had died onboard. It is not clear whether they died after catching Covid-19.“Unfortunately, four of our fellow guests have passed away – one last night, two yesterday and one a few days ago,” the ship’s captain Captain Jan Smit said in an announcement, which was obtained by . “We are still seeing both guests and crew with symptoms reporting to the medical center. The situation continues to grow more challenging each day.”Panamanian authorities have refused to let the Zaandam cruise liner pass through the canal in Central America to attempt dock in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Chile and Argentina have also refused to let the cruise ship enter port, which departed Punta Arenas in Chile on 14 March.Rick de Pinho, a passenger on the ship with his wife Wendy, told the : “Life on the boat took a serious turn when our captain asked us to return and stay in our cabins on March 22 around 2pm ship time.“Meals were delivered three times a day and initially included hot meals but that seems to no longer be the case.”“While we scraped together the pieces of information, no one was really prepared to learn that four had passed away. It’s one of those moments when you realise the severity of the situation. While we are holding up well I truly was bothered to see my wife’s eyes tearing up.”Passenger Laura Gabaroni Huergo of Florida has been issuing pleas for government assistance for days from the cabin she’s sharing with her husband, but she said the bad news announced on the ship Friday left her speechless and fearful.We’ve “not heard any details about where we go from here,” she said in a message to the . “We are waiting and hoping that all the parties involved will do the right thing, for both the ill and the healthy.”Many on board the Zaandam have only been able to pass messages via Whatsapp or through family members due to poor internet connection. Before passengers are allowed to move to the Rotterdam, which brought supplies and Covid-19 test kits to the stranded boat, travellers are screened for illness but many are not passing the tests.“People are being screened on the basis of a medical questionnaire and if anyone has had a cough, cold, fever, runny nose, breathing problems, headaches or sore throat within the last 10 days, then they fail the medical. Lots of people are bound to have had non related coughs, colds, etc., during this time, so many are failing the medical,” one woman on board explained.The wife of one of the 85 crew members in isolation with flu-like symptoms on the Zaandam expressed concerns about the conditions for staff.“Those who are confined were quarantined in a five square metre cabin, given only three small pieces of bread and a small amount of cereals,” she said, adding there is a lack of water, fresh air and two people are confined to each cabin room. was also contacted by an NHS doctor whose mother and aunt are on the Zaandam, who was scared her loved ones were being left “stranded at sea” while she cared for people back in the UK.“They are being left onboard scared and anxious. They have not stepped foot on land for over 2 weeks. My mum had an existing cough and for this reason she was refused on the rescue boat and kept on the ‘sick ship’ Zaandam. They are so close to land and just want to get home. Can someone not help them like I am helping others?” she told the .The Zaandam, is just one of at least 10 ships stuck at sea as of Thursday-- carrying nearly 10,000 passengers – around the globe, after having been turned away from their destination ports in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, a  analysis of ship tracking data has found.In a statement on Friday, Holland America Line said that once healthy passengers had been moved to the Rotterdam, the company planned to sail both cruise ships to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, keeping all passengers in isolation on both ships.But when contacted by the , Broward County authorities in Florida said it had not yet received a formal request for docking from Holland America, nor has a plan been worked out with the federal and state health officials. “It’s very scary,” said Broward County Commissioner Michael Udine Friday. “We are waiting for a plan to be presented to us.”“I don’t believe that the Panama Canal people will let their employees get on a ship with coronavirus in order to get it through the canal,” he said. “It’s a sticky situation.”He said, before the county commission could approve a docking in Fort Lauderdale “we would need to be sure that it is safe for the residents of South Florida”.“Remember, we’re already a hotspot,” said Udine, noting that hospitals in Broward County are already filling up with Covid-19 patients and running short of medical supplies. “It would be difficult for us if 1500 people (potentially needing treatment) just got off the ship.”In a statement, the Panama Canal said that all journeys through the system required their staff to board ships and restrictions on ships with Covid-19 outbreaks were in place to protect workers.Panama is battling the largest outbreak in the region, with 786 cases and 14 deaths as of Friday.The British Foreign Office said they are doing “all they can” to help citizens on board and are in close contact with the cruise operator and authorities in the region."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab3429138ce8a7e9efc954b4ec8a8d2269016d68/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=269b4522f8d22e233c82c12583548d22","title":"coronavirus live news cases in italy overtake china us infections pass 100000","story":"Trump invokes Defence Protection Act Syria introduces travel restrictions The UK, Spain, Italy see biggest daily rise in deaths.

Let’s keep perspective,” she wrote in a message, reprinted in full below.\u0026nbsp“Homeschooling is a choice . . . you are your child’s school teacher in whatever form you choose . This is at best distance learning. In reality, it’s everyone trying to separate their bums from their elbows because none of us know what we’re doing and what’s right and wrong here.”She also said it was “absolutely not possible” to facilitate distance learning with a primary-aged child and work from home at the same time.“The very idea is nonsense. If you’re trying to do that, stop now. You can certainly have activities where your child learns, but your focus is your job, and survival. Again, unprecedented. Stop trying to be superheroes,” she wrote.Speaking to The  , Golden said she wrote it originally in a parenting group after seeing parents’ anxiety online.“They felt they were suddenly expected to be parent, employee and teacher all at the same time, as well as wading through their own stress and worry around this unprecedented situation.“But ultimately I wanted people to recognise that they are in charge, they are the primary educator and they needed to let go of any worry or guilt around their choices for their children in this timeHer post has now been shared by hundreds of thousands of people, by schools and by parents across the world, which has been “a surreal experience”.“I didn’t expect it to go beyond the original group. Hence the tone being very informal and casual and not what I’d have gone with had it been a letter directly to our parents or an article for the website,” she says.“It’s been shared over 100k times on Facebook between different pages which is surreal to say the least. But I’m happy it struck a chord and the feedback that it has really reassured parents is very rewarding.”Message from Catriona Golden to parents:Covid Distance Learning Q\u0026ampAUsual disclaimer, I’m a school principal but I speak only for myself. Others may have different ideasI’m seeing a lot of threads online with the same general theme, so I wanted to just given a schools perspective on it all and answer some FAQs. Also happy to answer any questions people have that I can answer.Lots of people feeling stressed, overwhelmed and under pressure by the work being sent home for kids. I hope this can help with that somewhat.Few points to note first :1) This is not homeschooling. This is an unprecedented emergency situation impacting the whole world. Let’s keep perspective. Homeschooling is a choice, where you considered, you plan for it and you are your child’s school teacher in whatever form you choose . This is at best distance learning. In reality, it’s everyone trying to separate their bums from their elbows because none of us know what we’re doing and what’s right and wrong here.2) You are, and always have been, your child’s primary educator. If you decide that your child isn’t going to engage with anything sent home and is going to spend the entire period playing in the dirt, or baking, or watching TV, that is your choice. That is your right. It is clear in the constitution. There is nothing to stress or feel guilty about.3) Schools don’t know what they’re doing either. They got no notice, no prep time and we’re told “continue to plan lessons as normal and just send them home’ as if that is in any way possible. If it were, we’d all be out of a job very quickly. I won’t rant about my thoughts on the Dept on this, but suffice it to say your school is winging it.”4) It is absolutely not possible to facilitate distance learning with a primary aged child and work from home at the same time. The very idea is nonsense. If you’re trying to do that, stop now. You can certainly have activities where your child learns, but your focus is your job, and survival. Again, unprecedented. Stop trying to be superheroes.- My school has sent home lots of physical work. Pages and pages, hours and hours. How am I supposed to get through it all?!You’re not, don’t try. Your child’s teacher spent a couple of hours in utter panic gathering things to send home so they could say they did their best and there weren’t a lot if complaints that enough didn’t go home. It’s not a competition, or a race, it’s unlikely the teacher will even manage to look at it all.- My school keeps sending home links and emails with more work. How do I make it stop. AhhhhhhSee above. These are suggestions and ideas because the school is worried it’ll be said they’re not offering enough. Use them if they suit you, don’t if they don’t. If you’re getting stressed, stop opening the emails. No one will know!- X in my child’s class has everything done and we’ve barely started. Will they fall behind?Even if everything were equal in terms of support and time and number of kids etc (which it’s not) kids learn at different rates. In the class there’s a wide range of levels in all subjects, there’s different paces and there are many kids working on differentiated level of work. It’s almost impossible for teachers do differentiate at the moment, so you have to do it. By expectation and by time.Your child will not fall behind. This is all revision and reminder work. If kids could learn new concepts without specific teaching we wouldn’t need teachers. They will cover all of this again, multiple times.- I’m not doing any work with my kids. All their doing is Lego, cooking and playing outside.All of this is learning. Very valuable learning. Give yourself and them a break.- How can I get three different lots of work done with 3 different kids of different ages?You can’t, stop trying. If they’re old enough, try to get them to do little bits independently. Otherwise try to do something they can all engage with, reading a story together, some free writing, baking etc.- So what’s the bare minimum you’d expect?For me, survival mode. I won’t pretend that may be true of all teachers, but you know what if they can’t have perspective in a time like this then I wouldn’t overly worry about their opinion anyway.My ideal for my kids in our school?- A bit of reading every day (independent or to them or via audiobook etc).- some free writing now and then. If they’ll keep a diary or something, great. If not, would they draw a comic?- Practical hands on maths. Be that via cooking, cleaning, outside or some maths games physical or digital.- Some fine motor work. Lego, cutting, playdough, tidying up small toys.- Some artmusic where possible through the week. Doesn’t need to be guided.-Stretch goal, if old enough getting them to independently work on a project is great for keeping brains ticking over. Get them researching in a book or online and putting together something to present to you or family.- If younger, lots of imaginative free play, the more independent the better.You are doing enough. You are loving your kids and supporting them through a difficult time. Look after yourself. Minimising stress is absolutely vital in a time like this for mental health. Don’t let this be something that stresses you. Only you can control that by accepting it is in your circle of control, you are the primary educator and this is all your call.Happy to answer any questions if you have any.*Apologies, this post is much longer than anticipated! *Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4214259.1585350297!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"usit closure how a student run travel firm engineered a social revolution","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Usit stand at a jobs fair in 2012. The company, which has closed, offered  affordable travel to generations of students.  Photograph: Alan Betson  THE IRISH TIMES Ask any former student about their first taste of independent travel and chances are they’ll mention the J1, cramped house-shares and Usit.The travel firm, which started out 60 years ago, helped to engineer a small-scale social revolution by opening up affordable travel to students for the first time.Prior to Usit, Irish students were a fairly sheltered group. The only time anyone went abroad was to emigrate. The company helped to change all that.On Friday evening it announced that it has closed following a tsuanmi of events spurred by the coronavirus pandemic.More than 100 jobs have been lost . The company says the outcome for students who booked travel with Usit is “uncertain”.ShoestringIt marks the end of a business which started out on a shoestring in June 1959. A group of entrepreneurial students at Trinity College and University College Dublin began operating a travel desk to send their colleagues to Britain and France for the summer from as little as £4 and\u0026nbsp15 pence.The business was run for three decades years by Gordon Colleary, a former UCD student known for his dapper dress sense, complete with multi-coloured dickie-bow and tinted glasses.Margins in the student travel business were always lean there were several grim periods when it all threatened to unravel.In the early 1970s, the company was charging students £57 for a round-trip to the US which it considered a rock-bottom price.At the time, Usit was struggling and under pressure to increase fares to keep the business afloat. At the same time, a new company opened in Dublin controlled by businessman Patrick Duignan. He was offering hard-pressed students a £49 round trip to the US.Colleary was at a loss to understand how he could survive on margins even skimpier than its own.A few years later, the body of Usit’s once powerful competitor was recovered from the River Thames in London. His hands were tied behind his back.It later emerged he had been killed because he had run up huge debts and those he owed had finally run out of patience. It was a grim tale but illustrative of the travel trade’s brutal competitionRapidIn the 1990s, Usit’s rapid growth mirrored the flourishing economy. It expanded rapidly and muscled in on the student travel trade abroad by acquiring rival companies. By the year 2000, the Irish market accounted for just 20 per cent of its turnover.The Union of Students in Ireland, which owned a large chunk of the firm, still had students on the board, though investors weren’t so keen on novices having such sway.In the end, USI sold its stake in the company for £9 million and invested the windfall in a new headquarters and a portfolio of shares and other investments.Just as the company explored floating publicly, disaster struck. Its US arm plunged into the red following September 11th. The company ended up going into examinership\u0026nbspand some of its subsidiaries were liquidated.The company survived, though in much smaller form. It traded profitably, for the most part, and continued to arrange for thousands of Irish students to travel to the US on their J1s.In recent weeks, a series events spurred by the coronavirus pandemic meant the company finally capsized.The number of students applying for J1 visas had been declining before the coronavirus outbreak.In 2013, over 8,000 students travelled to the US on the visa, while just over\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp3,000 applied last year, a drop of about\u0026nbsp60 per cent.But, earlier this month, the US suspended the J1 summer visa programme for some applicants in response to the coronavirus outbreak. A language school which formed part of the businesses also closed recently.\u0026nbspThe USI, meanwhile, has advised students who are trying to secure refunds to make contact with Usit’s liquidators or seek advice from the Citizen\u0027s Information service.For former students of a certain age, however, Usit will forever be synonymous with their first heady \u0026nbsptaste of foreign travel, culture shock and true independence.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4213929.1585320294!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"benign impact of covid 19 on air quality and carbon emissions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Satellites offer a unique vantage point to monitor the health of our planet.’ File photograph: GettyThe world is in a dark place, gripped by a pandemic that could rage for months and take countless lives. But it has led to an astonishing fall in air pollution in the most heavily populated parts of the planet. European Space Agency (ESA) satellites offer remarkable, colour-coded animations to illustrate the change: carbon emissions have declined sharply as lives are put on hold, industry is scaled down, streets quieten, aircraft grounded.Over the past six weeks, readings from the agency’s Sentinel-5P satellite show nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels over cities and industrial clusters in Asia and Europe were markedly lower compared to 2019, resulting in less air pollution. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service has found a significant drop in nitrous oxides and fine particulate matter (PM), the air pollutant produced by traffic (especially diesel vehicles) and the burning of wood, peat and coal. With satellite observations and computer models of the atmosphere, researchers have found a 20 to 30 per cent reduction in surface PM over huge swathes of China. “Satellites offer a unique vantage point to monitor the health of our planet. Sentinel-5P is one of seven Copernicus satellites in orbit today. It currently provides the most accurate measurements of NO2 and other trace gases from space,” explains Josef Aschbacher, ESA’s director of Earth observation. “As NO2 is primarily produced by traffic and factories, it is a first-level indicator of industrial activity worldwide. What is clearly visible is a significant reduction of NO2 levels over China, caused by reduced activity due to Covid-19 restrictions.”Slowdown took out the equivalent of almost 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 in China and could curb global emissions from air travel by 11 to 19 per cent, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. As Ireland is not heavily industrialised, effects here are less pronounced but discernible with restrictions ratcheted up in the past fortnight.Greenhouse gas emissions are audited on a yearly basis by the Environmental Protection Agency, whereas air pollutants are monitored on a real-time basis. The March bulletin will show a downward curve but up to February it was very much business as usual with 18 exceedances of European Union NO2 limits, mainly in Dublin.The 2009 crash coincided with the only significant drop in our carbon emissions in the past 20 years. At present, we are among the worst emitters on a per capita basis due to transport, agriculture and poorly-heated buildings reliant on fossil fuels, while increased urbanisation has resulted in often dangerous levels of air pollution.With recent declines, some pollution emissions such as those associated with traffic are likely to be reduced and therefore will reduce air pollution damage to one’s respiratory system, according to Prof Colin O’Dowd of NUIG Centre for Climate and Air Pollution studies. These emissions, however, “are likely to have already caused damage previously, perhaps weakening one’s defence”. His colleague Dr Clare Noone notes air pollution is estimated to be responsible for eight million deaths per year and fossil fuels are largely to blame. “If you live in an area with poor air quality you’re already vulnerable to many health effects, and the associated lung damage from air pollution may worsen those infected with Covid-19.”Once the pandemic has passed, she hopes valuable lessons will be learned about the importance of the air we breathe and our health. “Putting our health and the health of the planet first will mean moving away from fossil fuels . . . to clean renewable energy. More than ever, the time to act on climate and the time to act on health is now.”Coronavirus-prompted trends show what collective action could do in rapidly countering global heating caused by human activity and is already prompting the big question: to what extent recovery will be infused by green actions? Climatologist Prof John Sweeney of Maynooth University says the circumstances are “not the way we would like to tackle climate change” – it is likely to buy some time but prove to be a temporary respite.That said, there is a possibility of change for the better in adopting a more sustainable way of living. In bailing out industries, especially carbon-polluting ones, governments should be conscious there are other ways of doing it, he believes, citing former US president Barack Obama’s rescuing of the US auto industry after the 2009 crash – on condition that vehicles were made more fuel efficient.Warmer winters, longer flu season?This approach should be applied to the aviation and shipping sectors if vast amounts of taxpayer funds are going to be channelled to their benefit, believes Prof Sweeney. Otherwise it would be back to business as usual. However, it is already clear the pandemic will prompt behavioural change. There was likely to be a fall in business travel. “We are seeing that people commute more readily by mouse rather than by car or train,” he says. “Reduced emissions buy the planet a little time but not more than a few years,” he says.Eminent climate scientist Prof Katharine Hayhoe says she is being constantly asked what Covid-19 has to do with climate change? Her response: “The short answer is very little, but the long answer is everything is relative.” The death toll already caused by climate disruption will be seen to outstrip the worst World Health Organisation predictions for coronavirus, she predicts.Coronavirus is being spread by humans, while climate disruption is not significantly affecting spread. “That one’s on us. It goes where we go.”With predictions of warmer winters, a likely consequence is earlier and more severe flu seasons, she said in a Twitter exchange. As the planet warms the flu season could end up being year round and this would give it more time to mutate into more dangerous strains. All of which is just another indication that climate change is “a threat multiplier”. Meanwhile, the other side of the coin is “what will this terrible pandemic do to our emissions?”It is already slashing fossil-fuel use and corresponding carbon and air pollution emissions in China, Italy and beyond. “I think it’s too early to say whether we will see a net long-term decrease in carbon emissions from this alone. Industrial production is likely to ramp back up after the crisis passes. But I do hope it will show us there is a different way to live,” adds Prof Hayhoe.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe The Government has announced further sweeping restrictions on social and commercial life tonight as it struggles to contain the spread of\u0026nbspcoronavirus.From midnight tonight, the country is on lockdown, with people told to stay in their homes with only a limited number of reasons for which they can leave.For the next two weeks, citizens must stay at home, with limited exceptions. People working in essential services will be allowed to travel to work and people will be allowed to leave home to shop for food or exercise within 2km of their homes. Otherwise people are being told to stay at home, with all travel beyond 2km from their homes banned.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar\u0026nbspsaid they were radical actions, in addition to restrictions already in place, to try to save as many lives as possible.He said: “With effect from midnight tonight for a two-week period until Easter Sunday, April 12th, everybody must stay at home in all circumstances except for the following situations:All public and private gatherings of any number of people outside a single household or living unit are prohibited, he said.A further range of non-essential shops and services will be closed, he added.Adult community education centres and local community centres will be shut.All non-essential surgery, health procedures and other non essential health services will be postponed.All visits to hospitals, other residential healthcare settings and prisons are to cease, with specific exceptions on compassionate grounds.Meanwhile, shielding or cocooning will be introduced of all those aged over 70\u0026nbspand specified categories of people who are extremely vulnerable to Covid-19.Travel to offshore islands will be limited to residents of those islands.Pharmacists will be permitted to dispense medicines outside of the current period of validity of the existing prescription in line with the pharmacist’s clinical judgment.All public transport and passenger travel will be restricted only to essential workers and to people providing essential services.“Apart from the activities I’ve listed there should be no travel outside of 2km radius of your home for any reason,” Mr Varadkar said.The full list of essential workers will be published by the Government as early as possible on Saturday. \u0026nbsp In the meantime, the Government advice for businesses and services which consider themselves essential\u0026nbspis to remain open.It is understood they will include public and civil service personnel, those working in utilities, necessary goods (food and medicines), financial services, transport, and communications.Mr Varadkar was speaking in a televised press conference at Government Buildings with Minister for Health\u0026nbspSimon Harris and the chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan.These are the latest in a series of restrictions - and by far the most stringent - that the Government has steadily introduced since the outbreak of Covid-19 began. The aim is to slow the spread of the virus in order to allow hospitals to cope with an expected influx of patients.“There is not much more beyond this we could do in terms of restrictions,” Mr Varadkar said.Dr Holohan said that the measures were intended to “significantly interrupt the transmission of the virus”.He said that the emergence of clusters of the virus in nursing homes and other healthcare facilities was a significant concern for public health experts.Dr Holohan said it was “not possible to predict” whether the Government would be in a position to lift the restrictions in two weeks’ time.Mr Varadkar and Mr Harris paid tribute to a nurse who died as a result of contracting coronavirus. The person’s death is the first of a health worker in Ireland, one of three fatalities announced on Friday and one of 22 to have taken place since the virus outbreak began. There are now 2,121 recorded cases of the virus here, officials said, an increase of 302 since Thursday.Mr Varadkar said the number of ICU admissions as a result of Covid-19 cases had doubled since Monday.Signed into lawEarlier President\u0026nbspMichael D Higgins signed into law the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Bill 2020.It gives the Government extensive emergency powers to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and mitigate economic collapse.The Bill prevents evictions of tenants, imposes a rent freeze, allows restaurants to become takeaways and provides for the rehiring of retired health care workers and former soldiers.It also provides temporary income support schemes by contributing to wage costs to allow employers to continue paying their employees.In a statement after signing the Bill into law the President expressed his sympathies to all those who have lost a family member or friend to Covid-19.“As we enter a crucial period in our response to the Covid-19 pandemic, may I again express my sympathies to all those who have lost a family member or friend, and my best wishes to all those who have been infected by the virus, all those who have not had the opportunity to express their grief, or offer their care and visits to those they love.“May I express, on behalf of the people of Ireland, our shared sense of sadness at the increase in the number of our people who have died as a result of the pandemic.“Behind the statistics we will hear, or have read, that there are families grieving and people in distress because they cannot meet their loved ones.“As we muster our resolve to be far more vigilant as we enter a most difficult phase of tackling the virus, it is appropriate for me to express my thanks to the Irish people for their response to the crisis, and urge them to stay the course and encourage others to do so,” he said.He noted so many people are continuing to do their best “to keep us safe and to keep the country going, through their efforts in the health service, in public service bodies, in important social services, in shops and in pharmacies. It is appropriate that we, as a nation, thank them for their service by doing our bit, by complying with the HSE advice.“Extraordinary and difficult measures have been necessary as we try to stem the tide of increasing infection. The effects of those measures will become visible in the coming weeks.“The legislation is emergency legislation for a time of crisis. It is appropriate that it has time limits and leaves our constitutional rights in place.“These are difficult times, but our difficulties will come to an end. Let us make sure that, through the decisions and actions we take at present, we ensure the health and safety of each other, all of us together.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4214264.1585352737!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus people told to stay at home in virtually all circumstances","story":"Leo Varadkar has announced further sweeping restrictions on social and commercial life. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar announces a tightening of restrictions on the movements of people, to try and curb the spread of  Covid-19. Photograph: Crispin Rodwell People have been told to stay at home in virtually all circumstances and all public and private gatherings have been banned for two weeks as part of the Government’s latest sweeping measures to tackle coronavirus.More non-essential shops and services will be closed, non-essential surgery is to stop and a ban on visiting hospitals and other healthcare settings is being imposed except on compassionate grounds.The only exceptions to the stay-at-home rule is for travel to health, social care or other essential work, shopping for food and takeaways, medical appointments and for “vital family reasons” such as providing care.People will also be allowed take “brief, inidual” physical exercise within 2km of their home, and farming will continue. Major policing Late on Friday night An Garda Síochána said there would be a major policing operation this weekend to ensure the new restrictions were being complied with. There will be a high visibility Garda presence all over the country involving thousands of gardaí on foot, bike and mobile patrols. The Garda operation which runs until 7am on Monday will focus on encouraging compliance with the new measures. However, the Garda said they would intervene where groups of people or venues or outlets were ignoring the new restrictions.The measures were announced shortly after the death of another three people from the virus was announced.Among the fatalities is the first healthcare worker to die in the outbreak, a nurse at Tallaght Hospital, The  understands.Shielding, or cocooning, is to be introduced for everyone over 70 years of age and other vulnerable categories of people, effectively requiring them to stay at home.The list of essential workers exempted from the provisions, to be published today, includes those in healthcare, social care, the public and civil service, utilities, necessary goods (food and medicine), financial services, transport and communications, it is understood. Journalists are also expected to be included.Use of public transport is to be limited to people providing essential services, travel to offshore islands will be limited to residents and pharmacists will be able to dispense medicines even where prescriptions have expired.“These are radical actions aimed at saving as many people’s lives as possible,” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar declared, announcing the measures in Government Buildings. “In the days or weeks ahead, we’re not prisoners of fate, we can influence what’s going to happen to us next.”Mr Varadkar appealed to people to “give meaning to our freedom” by agreeing to the restrictions, “restricting how we live our lives, so that others may live”. “I’m asking us for a time to forego our personal liberties and freedoms for a greater cause. And I’m appealing to every man, woman and child in our country to make the sacrifices, not out of self interest, but for the love of each other.”Recommendations The extra measures are being introduced on foot of recommendations by the National Public Health Emergency Team at its meeting earlier on Friday.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said NPHET was concerned about increases in the numbers of cases, ICU admissions and deaths, as well as the emergence of 10 clusters of the disease in nursing homes. A total of 22 people with Covid-19 have now died in the Republic. The number of new confirmed cases of the disease surged to 302 yesterday, the highest daily total so far. There are now 2,121 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland. The number of cases is doubling roughly every four days, which is somewhat better than was forecast at the start of the outbreak.Up to last Wednesday, 419 patients had been hospitalised with the disease, it said, and 59 of these had been admitted to ICU.While declining to describe the measures as a “lockdown”, Mr Varadkar admitted they were “very restrictive” and added: “There isn’t much more we can do.”He admitted the measures would be hard to police but said the gardaí have powers to detain people and that penalties can be imposed.Meanwhile President Michael D Higgins has signed into law the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Bill 2020.It gives the Government extensive emergency powers to combat the pandemic and mitigate economic collapse.The Bill prevents evictions of tenants, imposes a rent freeze, allows restaurants to become takeaways and provides for the rehiring of retired healthcare workers and former soldiers.It also provides temporary income support schemes by contributing to wage costs to allow employers to continue paying their employees.President Higgins said it was for “a time of crisis” and it was appropriate it had time limits and left constitutional rights in place.Protective equipment Stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare staff tackling the Covid-19 outbreak are “beginning to run low”, according to the Health Service Executive. It is currently seeking to redistribute stocks to sites with “particular shortages”, it said. A large shipment of PPE is scheduled to arrive in Dublin Airport on Sunday and be distributed in the following days, but it remains unclear if existing supplies will be sufficient to bridge the gap until then.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"If both parties agree, orders on visitation and maintenance can be alteredSupplier cites recent Italian law that domestic need take precedence over exportsGarda\u0026iacute, medics and Minister for Transport concerned at increase in road deathsSector to seek financial support as nine clusters of Covid-19 found in nursing homesTaoiseach introduces sweeping new measures on social and commercial activityGarda\u0026iacute to mount major show of force over weekend to ensure complianceVaradkar urges everyone to stay at home for two weeks except in limited circumstancesCitizens are told not to walk more than 2km from their homesCompanies around the country have announced initiatives amid coronavirus crisisA new cohort \u0026ndash grandparents \u0026ndash are not used to being alone, says phone service managerFour people have died on MS Zaandam but none of the deceased thought to be IrishThree more deaths and 302 new cases confirmed in the State on FridayAlmost 30 airlines suspend all flights to and from airport for weeks and months aheadDepartment asks managers to consider flexible working or redeploying personnelMove comes amid continuing tensions between DUP and Sinn F\u0026eacutein on reaction to crisisAndrew McGinley\u0026rsquos three children were found dead at their home in JanuaryTrevor Rowe (28) remanded in custody after he was accused over death of Anne Butler (71)Police to be given spit and bite guards to protect against \u0026lsquoabhorrent\u0026rsquo attacksNew guidelines instruct solicitors to witness clients\u0026rsquo signatures through windows in keeping with Covid-19 precautionsStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4214039.1585326079!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus approval secured to fly home irish stranded in peru","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA file image of Machu Picchu in Peru. The Government has been given approval to send a repatriation flight to the country to pick up more than 100 Irish citizens who are stranded as a result of restrictions introduced in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Image: iStock.The Government has been given approval to send a repatriation flight to Peru to pick up more than 100 Irish citizens who are stranded as a result of restrictions introduced in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that following a call between Minister Simon Coveney and his Peruvian counterpart “diplomatic clearance” had been secured for the flight to leave at 4pm on Sunday. The Government has been partnering with the UK embassy in Lima in arranging the flight. “Our Embassy in Santiago is in contact with our citizens on the ground in Peru keeping them informed,” the department said.“A large amount of effort is also going into arrangements for the internal transport of our citizens, especially from Cusco to Lima. That remains a very challenging situation and we are doing everything that we can in order for this to take place as planned over the next couple of days.”Around 135 Irish tourists, most of them backpackers, are awaiting repatriation after the Peruvian government ordered the closure of its borders on March 16th as it imposed a strict 15-day national lockdown in response to the pandemic. Around half of them are thought to be outside Lima. Some of the Irish nationals in Peru have reported having to stay in shared hostel rooms for up to 23 hours a day because of the restrictions. The Irish ambassador in Chile, Paul Gleeson, has been coordinating the repatriation effort on the ground. Irish citizens in the cities of Cusco and Arequipa are expected to begin the journey to Lima on Saturday while others face a longer journey to the capital. They have been awaiting details of the flight since Sunday when Mr Coveney said an agreement had been reached between British Airways and Aer Lingus to charter a plane from Lima “in the next few days”.CautiousGalway native Gearóid McKendrick, who is in Cusco, said he was relieved to hear the flight had been arranged but remained “cautious as we’ve seen other nations being turned back when they are on buses to the airport”. In his communication announcing the flight, Mr Gleeson said officials were aware that some Irish nationals might not be able to leave because of quarantine restrictions. “I’d like to reassure those citizens that we will be continuing to work with EU and UK partners to identify solutions to bring you home as soon as circumstances allow,” he wrote.Rhys McKendry from Belfast said he was worried that he could miss the flight due to the quarantine at his hostel and is awaiting a call from the embassy to update him. “I am still totally in the dark,” he said, adding that he had hoped to take a Covid-19 test to prove he was negative so he could travel. “But I haven’t had any update on testing. Ministry of health instead showed us how to wash our hands, instead of interviewing us as promised.”Irish travellers stuck in Peru contacted by The  have expressed their appreciation for the efforts of Irish diplomats.“In my opinion I think the Irish Government have been doing everything they can behind the scenes,” says Mr McKendrick. “It sounds like the block has been coming from the Peruvian side. Tourists from other countries in Europe stuck here have been receiving the same information from their embassies about limited numbers of planes allowed to come into the country and airspace being closed and that causing complications in organising the flights.”ChallengeFor the department the challenge of getting Irish people stranded abroad because of the pandemic has been unprecedented. Global aviation is currently experiencing the largest shutdown in its history, with airspace across some regions closed off.An estimated 2,000 Irish citizens have been caught up in the crisis. Most are in Australia and New Zealand but diplomats are dealing with cases in 86 countries in total. In recent days the priority has been to try and get as many Irish people as possible onto the rapidly shrinking number of commercial flights.Until next week at the earliest there are no commercial flights permitted in or out of Peru. Frightened by the threat Covid-19 posed to its fragile health system, Peru moved swiftly to shut itself off from the outside world. As well as those from Ireland there are thousands of tourists from other European countries, Latin America and the US among others stuck in the South American country.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4214228.1585340579!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus oxygen equipment meant for ireland held back by italy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA patient with Covid-19 wears a transparent plastic helmet filled with oxygen at a hospital in Bergamo, Italy. Photograph: Fabio BucciarelliThe New York TimesCrucial medical supplies for Covid-19 patients in Ireland have been held back by a major supplier, citing restrictions on exports imposed by Italian authorities.This is despite a European Union deal to drop export bans on medical equipment within Europe earlier this month.The shipment is the first consignment in an order of 1,000 specially designed hoods, manufactured in Italy, which administer high-pressure oxygen to patients in a manner that reduces the risk of healthcare workers being exposed to the virus.A spokesman for the importing company, Orega Systems, said it had ordered the units from its Italian partner at the start of the month, but they had not arrived. The equipment is destined for hospitals around the country.A letter sent to Orega Systems by the Italian manufacturer, seen by The , states: “We regret to inform you that the Italian government has imposed restrictions on the export of ventilators, hoods, full face masks and other devices used for providing respiratory therapies.”“As these devices are considered essential products for treating those ill with the coronavirus, in this extraordinary emergency situation, manufacturers are obliged to supply the Italian hospitals and the Civil Protection Authority first.”Non-invasive ventilationThe exporting company cited a law introduced on February 28th during the Covid-19 outbreak by Italy, which states companies must give priority to orders by Italian civil authorities for medical equipment, and makes exports of key goods subject to approval.Dr Oisín O’Connell, a respiratory consultant in Bons Secours Hospital in Cork, said the hoods would enable non-invasive ventilation of patients with Covid-19. The machines detect difficulties in patients’ breathing and inject high-pressure oxygen into the hood. “For every breath, it gives you extra support. If you’re wrecked by this virus and you can barely take a breath, it will sense that and pump more in,” Dr O’Connell said. It has the added benefit of limiting the spread of virus breathed out.The machines are high-end units available only to hospitals, not for retail use.They are more flexible than ventilators, and can be deployed in a variety of hospital settings, meaning the treatment can be delivered in any room or corridor. They are significantly cheaper than ventilators, costing €2,500-€5,000 compared with up to €40,000, Dr O’Connell said. Italy passed laws last month stating that protective equipment, ventilators and ventilator parts can only be exported if authorised by Italian Civil Protection. Other EU states such as Germany later imposed restrictions also.Freedom of goodsThe European Commission appealed for countries to drop such bans, saying they were contrary to freedom of goods in the single market. On March 15th the commission imposed an EU-wide ban on exports of crucial medical goods to countries outside the EU and European Economic Area, in an attempt to persuade EU states to continue supplying to each other.But the blocking of supplies to Irish hospitals indicates this has failed to work.“Obviously the export of medical goods made in Italy, that the nation needs, evidently creates a conflict,” a spokesman for Italy’s Civil Protection said. A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said it was “aware of this case and is working to extend all possible assistance in resolving this issue”. The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Photograph: Sasko LazarovRollingNews.iePA WireOn Friday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced a range of new restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of coronavirus. Here is his speech in full:Tonight, I want to speak to you about the next stage in our national response to the coronavirus emergency.Before I do so, I want to express my condolences to the families and friends of those who passed away today - one of whom was a health care worker.I want to thank all of you for continuing to abide by public health advice.By doing so, you are saving lives and protecting our health service and its staff.Once again, thank you to everyone who is working as part of this Great National Effort whether at work or working from home.Our country is rising to this challenge.I am convinced that we shall prevail.At the beginning of this emergency, I told you that there would be difficult days ahead.We knew that the virus would spread in our country, that tragically, many of our citizens would suffer and that some would die.I also promised that we would do all that we could do to protect the health of our citizens, to prepare our health service, to support our healthcare staff and to try to cushion the blow to the economy, our businesses and your livelihoods.Today, with cross-party support, the Oireachtas has passed further emergency legislation.This will help businesses to keep their staff in work, it will increase social welfare payments for people who lose their jobs, as a consequence of the emergency, including the self-employed.Payments under these new schemes have already commenced.Rents are frozen. There will be no evictions.When I spoke to you on St Patrick’s Day I said that more actions would be required in the coming weeks to slow the spread of the virus.Over this month we have seen the numbers of people falling ill increase every day. We have seen loved ones die.Guided by the expert advice of our Public Health Emergency Team, led by the Chief Medical Officer, we believe that this is now the time for these actions.I also told you that there would be a calm before the storm.The aim of every single action that we have taken is to reduce the impact of the storm on our country.To slow down this virus, to push it back and contain it.Throughout all of this, the Government has acted on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer and the National Public Health Emergency Team - an expert team of public health doctors, virologists and scientists.Today, they informed the Government that the number of confirmed cases in Ireland exceed 2,100.Sadly, the number of deaths is 22.There is a day on day increase in the number of admissions to intensive care units, and the number has doubled since Monday.Transmission in the community accounts for more than half of all cases.There continues to be an increasing number of clusters, many of which are in nursing home and residential care settings.The Government has received further recommendations on the actions that we need to take to protect our people.These are in addition to all of the existing measures that are already in place.So, with effect from midnight tonight, for a two-week period until Easter Sunday, April 12th.Everybody must stay at home in all circumstances, except for the following situations:To travel to and from work, or for purposes of work, only where the work is an essential health, social care or other essential service and cannot be done from home. A list will be provided.All public and private gatherings of any number of people outside a single household or living unit are prohibited.The virus might be in your household already - so don’t spread it to someone else’s.Sadly, this prohibition includes social family visits that are not for the vital reasons I have already mentioned.A further range of non-essential shops and services will be closed.The guidance given earlier in the week, in respect of essential retail outlets will be revised, to reflect this.Adult community education centres and local community centres will be shut.All non-essential surgery, health procedures and other non-essential health services will be postponed.All visits to hospitals, residential healthcare centres, other residential settings and prisons are to cease, with specific exceptions on compassionate grounds.Shielding, or cocooning, will be introduced for all those over 70 years of age and specified categories of people who are extremely vulnerable to Covid-19. Detailed guidance will be available.Travel to our offshore islands will be limited to residents of those islands.Pharmacists will be permitted to dispense medicines outside the current period of validity of the existing prescription in line with the pharmacist’s clinical judgement.All public transport and passenger travel will be restricted only to essential workers and people providing essential services.Apart from the activities I have listed, there should be no travel outside 2km radius from your home for any other reason.These are radical actions aimed at saving as many lives as possible in the days and weeks ahead. We are not prisoners of fate - we can influence what is going to happen. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.As we enter this most intensive phase of restrictive actions, the Government’s emergency response will be ramped up.Local emergency response will be led by local authorities who will bring together all the state agencies, as well as local community groups, charities and volunteers, to ensure that all of our citizens get the help they need at this exceptional time.Freedom was hard won in our country, and it jars with us, to restrict and limit inidual liberties, even temporarily. But freedom is not an abstract concept.We give it meaning every single day - in the way we live our lives - and in the decisions we take willingly to protect our loved ones.So I am asking people to give meaning to our freedom and liberty by agreeing to these restrictions.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFP“Be kind” has become a mantra for many as countries all over the world – including Ireland – try to come to terms with the greatest global public health crisis in a century.Economies everywhere are in freefall, people are losing their jobs by the thousands and everyone – or at least those who are behaving responsibly – are limiting their contact with other human beings and staying in their homes. People are afraid as the world fights an invisible enemy.But there are good news stories too. Businesses big and small and iniduals have been taking steps to make things just a little better for their customers and for wider society in these dark days.Cafes and restaurants are feeding their neighbours and the critical frontline healthcare workers who are putting in long shifts in hospitals across the country, distilleries have turned their attention to making hand sanitiser, gyms and yoga studios are offering free online classes and multinational companies have played their part, often without looking for any attention.Here are just some of the businesses who are doing the right thing today. There are many hundreds more.Micil Distillery in Galway has paused its poitín making and is making hand-sanitiser for Salthill and Galway community groups that have pre-purchased quantities at cost to distribute to the elderly and less well off, who may not be able to afford such a “luxury”.Clonakilty Distillery have also switched to producing hand sanitisers as have several other distilleries around the country.Nespresso, the global coffee company, have been sending machines and supplies of coffee to hospitals and testing centres around Ireland and have sought no publicity for the move.Vodafone Ireland has rolled out measures to help some of the most vulnerable and isolated people in Ireland during thecoronavirus crisis. It has donated 1,000 new smartphones along with 2,000 x €20 credit top-ups to Alone, the organisation which supports older people.Crucially, the smartphones have all been pre-loaded with useful apps including WhatsApp, Facebook, Spotify, RTÉ News along with information about online food deliveries and other important phone numbers.The company has also made an emergency donation to Women’s Aid so that the charity can provide immediate assistance and services to women identified as being under increased threat from abuse and violence during this time.Earlier this week, Ryanair offered its entire fleet of 450 aircraft to EU governments for rescue flights and to transport vital medicines, personal protective equipment and emergency food supplies across the world.MealsFeed the Heroes is a fund set up in response to the Covid-19 emergency to thank and support Ireland’s healthcare workers. The fund is being used to help provide the 200,000 healthcare workers fronting the effort to combat Ireland’s biggest ever public health crisis with a warm nutritious meal as a token of gratitude. Feed the Heroes is working with restaurants and catering companies to prepare the meals and co-ordinating with the healthcare teams to ensure they get to where they are needed.Established by Cian O’Flaherty with a view to raising €1,000 to fund a few meals an overwhelming response has seen more than €470,000 raised from almost 10,000 donations over the last 12 days.Lidl and FoodCloud have also launched an emergency food appeal in stores across the country to support people in need. Lidl is appealing to customers who would like to purchase an extra tinned or long shelf-life product to leave it in a dedicated trolley in shops this weekend. The donations will then be distributed through FoodCloud to local charities and food banks.Specsavers staff have been carrying out remote hearing aid repairs and delivering prescription frames to people’s home while their stores have been open for emergency scenarios and have looked after healthcare workers, food delivery drivers and other essential service providers.Peter Mark has been offering people tutorials on how to keep their hair sleek and shiny as all the salons are closed.McKenna and Co Solicitors in Dublin is organising wills for free during the crisis. “While we can’t offer healthcare, we can offer legal advice and services, and that is why we are offering free wills.

Tom Gilligan of Mayo County Council says the emphasis of the initiative  would be on sourcing homes for key workers, and to assist people living in overcrowded accommodation. Photograph: Chris IsonPA WireA local authority initiative designed to bring vacant homes back into use is seeking property owners to “answer Ireland’s call” and make housing available for medics returning from abroad.Vacanthomes.ie was developed in 2017 by Mayo County Council on behalf of the local government sector, to allow local authorities to identify empty houses that could be used to help solve the housing crisis.Tom Gilligan, director of services with Mayo County Council, said the emphasis of the initiative during the coronavirus pandemic would be on sourcing homes, on a short-term basis, for key workers such as hospital staff, and to assist people living in overcrowded accommodation.“We are already in the midst of a housing crisis and obviously with the new coronavirus pandemic the need for housing has become more acute.”In particular, he said, doctors nurses and other healthcare workers returning from abroad may not be a position to move in with family members, and could find it difficult to source appropriate accommodation.“People are coming back from abroad to help with this pandemic – medics and other key hospital staff. None of us know how long this pandemic is going to last, and hotel accommodation may not be the most suitable accommodation for them, beyond the very short term, if we want these medics to perform at their best,” Mr Gilligan said.“Those doctors and nurses are answering Ireland’s call. We want to send out a call to property owners who have vacant properties that it is time for them to step up and answer Ireland’s call.”Self-contained unitsVacanthomes.ie is working with the Housing Agency on a proposal to source vacant homes on short-term leases of three to six months to provide accommodation quickly. Mr Gilligan is appealing to anyone with a vacant property to come forward, including student-accommodation providers, where they can offer self-contained rather than communal units, institutional-property investors and large-scale landlords, or even people who have holiday homes.“The 2016 census showed there were 62,000 holiday homes. With remote working, it might be possible for people who live in cities or near hospitals who own holiday homes to instead move to those holiday homes, for the duration of the pandemic, so their houses in Dublin and elsewhere could be rented out to hospital staff for a short term.”The duration of the lease could be restricted to three to six months, but for those with concerns about being able to recover their properties at the end of the term, particularly large-scale landlords, “service level agreements” instead of leases could be established with local authorities, Mr Gilligan said.“We need to be innovative and think outside the box here. We want to look at all the options to maximise the number of homes we can bring into use.”Overcrowded homesIn addition to the need for housing for healthcare workers, there was a concern that coronavirus could spread in overcrowded homes.“We welcome that evictions can no longer take place but some people are still living in overcrowded accommodation, so we also need some of the many vacant homes around the country to help alleviate that pressure.”The reuse of existing homes was likely to become more important if larger housing construction sites began to close down, he said.“We are facing an extraordinary situation, the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetimes. And we need to look at radical solutions.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4214055.1585326856!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"washington ponders its purpose as political circus shuts down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Reflecting Pool in front of the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. Photograph: Mandel NganAFP via GettyThe US confronted a new normal this week as the reality of coronavirus set in. The economy, which had been shutting down little by little, state by state, shook to a halt. Restaurants, businesses and cafes closed their doors, hunkering down until the emergency passes.Like elsewhere, residents of Washington DC rediscovered the charms of the outdoors.Washington has always been a walker’s city, its big, bold public spaces and outdoor national monuments a magnet for tourists and dog-walkers.In a sad irony, the crisis has coincided with the most beautiful time of the year in the nation’s capital. Edged along the rim of the city’s famous tidal basin is a necklace of cherry blossom trees, their soft blush almost touching the water.The trees were a gift from the mayor of Tokyo in 1912. They are a symbol of international solidarity and connection whose original meaning has no doubt been lost on the current leader of the country, who talks of borders and boundaries in the face of a virus that has raced across the world.Residents have flocked to see the annual bloom, prompting stern warnings about social distancing from Washington’s mayor. Organisers of the cherry blossom festival have instead created a live internet stream capturing the trees during “peak bloom”. But still the people come, keeping an acceptable distant apart as they walk along the paths drenched with petals and foliage.Across the city, evidence of this new normal is discernible in the changed urban landscape.A new crop of joggers has spilled out on to the streets, having been exiled from the ubiquitous fitness studios of Washington DC. Some run along the centre of the streets, now emptied of cars as commerce shuts down.\u0026nbspThe city’s chirpiest residents, the grey squirrels, are still hopping along the national mall and the leafy streets near Dupont Circle. Some Washington residents have taken to sitting outdoors. Along one street in Georgetown, neighbours pass the hours perched on their front stoops. One elderly woman, pencil grasped in hand, is lost in concentration completing a crossword puzzle. Another strums a guitar.Open businessesThe shutdown has not affected all businesses equally. Some have managed to stay open.Down at the wharf along the Potomac river, the fish market is still in full swing, vendors shouting the daily catch and prices. The oldest continuously operating open-air seafood market in the United States, its dazzling selection of Chesapeake oysters and soft shell crab, North Carolina shrimp and red snapper, offer a bounty of delectable delights to eager customers rediscovering the joys of home cooking.Bookshops are also managing to adapt and survive. One of Washington’s most-loved institutions, Kramer’s Books, was still open on Wednesday, allowing customers to enter one at a time, and providing gloves and hand sanitiser at the door.Though the store was empty of customers, the shop assistant was fielding continuous phone and internet orders. Customers received their deliveries through Postmates, an online delivery service that has come into its own during the coronavirus crisis.But for most people in Washington DC, the shutdown has struck at the heart of what makes Washington.As the political centre of the United States, the city is built around social interaction, running on a constant diet of cocktail parties, power breakfasts and ambassadorial dinners. Based on a delicately balanced and highly political nexus of personal and professional connections, these social gatherings are the pulse of Washington life, generating their own sub-industries of the $150 blow-dry and chauffeur car services.Dinner burnedThis week the White House correspondents’ dinner – the apex of the Washington DC social calendar for this correspondent and others – bowed to the inevitable and called off its April 24th event. More significantly the cluster of exclusive parties that occur in the days before and after the dinner look doomed, as sponsors reconsider.The recalibration of life in Washington gives food for thought. As political staffers retreat to their apartments – some political campaigns working on November’s elections have taken to holding virtual “happy hours” –\u0026nbspthe coronavirus crisis has prompted introspection about the purpose and meaning of this town.The vanities, the name-dropping, the knowing handshakes that oil the political system, all appear somewhat redundant, vacuous, unnecessary. But these strange times are likely to pass. When the political system restarts in this all-important election year, Washington DC will be back with a bang, and the circus will begin once more.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178How does a coronavirus home test kit work, and how do I get one?What essential shops are open during the coronavirus lockdown?How many coronavirus cases are in your area?

The problem was that, earlier in the day, he had suggested there might be as many as 600,000. Asked to account for the difference, he said his earlier answer had taken into account asymptomatic cases. So what is it? 54,000 or 600,000?Italy is not alone. Earlier this week, the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Tokyo published a report into the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in February with more than 800 of the 3,711 people on board eventually diagnosed with Covid-19. According to the report, cited by the Japan Times, four-fifths of those infected showed no symptoms or just mild symptoms. Scans showed their lungs had suffered some physical consequences from the virus, but the patients had not been led by their symptoms to believe they were infected. Quite the reverse.Even in China, the poster child for lockdown and trace tactics which is edging back towards business as usual, there is uncertainty about asymptomatic cases. Estimates are classified. Officials insist all asymptomatic cases are unearthed by so-called contact tracing, yet even if this is true and every such case is detected, the numbers are not trivial: the South China Morning Post obtained details which suggested some 40,000 asymptomatic cases had been discovered in this way. It\u0027s hard not to believe there are many more. One way or another, it is clear that far more of us have, or have had, Covid-19, than the official figures tell us. But how many more? Only mass testing will give us a real picture of what is happening, and thus needs to happen at a far greater rate in the UK than is currently the case:Without mass testing, two very different pictures of the spread of the virus are emerging. On the one hand, there is the optimistic scenario, suggested by an Oxford paper which on Wednesday gained a huge amount of attention for a model suggesting that, given the current state of the UK outbreak, some 68 per cent of the population would have been infected by 19032020 – some 45 million of us, by last week, most presumably without even knowing it.Such a result would be dramatic. The outbreak is overblown, it would confirm. Most of us have already had the disease and are now fine. The NHS has survived the epidemic without even knowing it. But that was just one paper. There is another scenario. This one is that yes, there are lots of asymptomatic carriers (though far from 45 million), but rather than being beacons of hope and joy, they represent hidden problems – mines sown among the rest of us, ready to explode and cause a new outbreak just when it appears we might be on top of this one. According to researchers at the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (in a paper awaiting peer review), children may represent such mines because only around 20 per cent of them develop clinical symptoms (as opposed to 70 per cent in older adults). Yet it is not yet clear how infectious such largely asymptomatic people are. This critical question must be resolved to effectively forecast and control Covid-19 epidemics, the authors note.Such infection is certainly possible. In Wuhan on Tuesday, the one new case was that of a doctor reportedly infected by an asymptomatic patient. And on the Diamond Princess, studies suggest some of the 20 per cent of infected passengers who  suffered serious symptoms either went several days without obvious outward signs of the condition or caught it from those who never went on to develop serious symptoms.So is the epidemic mostly over or every bit as bad as we think, with the potential to erupt when we imagine we\u0027re through the worst? A single truth emerges: we will only discover the genuine picture through mass blood testing – a simple finger-prick tests that works like this:The testing must be followed, once the outbreak (whatever its true size) is controlled, by picking representative samples in the population to screen regularly, just as such samples are quizzed by pollsters to get a more or less accurate snapshot of national voting intention.In the middle of a mass global outbreak, it seems impossible to carry out whole population testing. Yet fate has twice thrown up unusual circumstances in which this has happened. The Diamond Princess was one such. The other was the 3,000-strong town of Vo, in Italy, where the entire population was tested after one of its citizens became the first to die of the disease.There, too, researchers found a significant proportion of the population (three per cent) had been infected without knowing it, representing the vast bulk of the 89 cases discovered. More generally, in the researchers\u0027 estimation, asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic subjects represent a good 70 per cent of all virus-infected people.There is good news in this: mass testing in Vo meant there were no further deaths. And factoring in asymptomatic cases also dramatically lowers the disease\u0027s mortality rate, which is currently based only on those who receive tests – usually those showing obvious or severe symptoms. And finally, if you had a fever or a hacking cough earlier in the year and, looking back, now swear you must have had Covid-19 – well, you might just be right.

Indeed, it appears to have acted far quicker to this outbreak than to its own – had that been the other way round, Europe\u0027s outbreak might not be so catastrophic. Yet despite the offers of help, gratefully received in some quarters, others have been far more sceptical about Beijing\u0027s motives. Many suspect they amount to a form of whitewashing – an effort to distract from initial failings and shift the focus away from who bears responsibility for the rampage of the virus through continents.Across Europe, hearts are hardening to China\u0027s offers, and their efforts to change the narrative may be about to backfire spectacularly.A crime against humanity is how the Italian opposition politician Matteo Salvini described China\u0027s response to the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, in a statement that will have struck a nerve in the country that has been worst affected.Salvini has form in criticism of Beijing, having spoken out often about what he called the colonisation of Italy as the Five Star Movement, his former coalition government partners, cosied up to China as part of a €2.5 billion deal under the Belt and Road Initiative.He has been critical of Chinese businesses investing in Italy, buying up factories once staffed by Italians and importing Chinese migrant workers in order to exploit the prestige of the Made in Italy label on goods such as textiles while keeping costs down. He has also been outspoken on the need for Italians\u0027 data, from banking information to mobile phones, to be kept in Italian hands, warning against allowing companies such as Huawei into the country and echoing the views of the US President, Donald Trump.Now, amid this outbreak, Salvini is using language sure to grip a public that has been slowly turning to the political right for years amid falling employment and a corrupt, failing bureaucratic system.China, of course, has been damned by much of the West for the way it treats its citizens, from human rights outrages in Xinjiang against the Uigher community to its new system of social credit. And that is before mentioning Tibet.Members of the Uighur community and sympathisers demonstrate against the Chinese government in Amsterdam in DecemberHuman rights is a phrase never far from the lips of those who criticise China. Now – amid an outbreak which many blame Beijing for not dealing with adequately at best, and facilitating through dishonesty at worst – the nightmare picture Salvini is painting for the Italian public is clear: China\u0027s crimes are not limited to its own people but will be visited upon you, too.Trump has for a long time demonised China, but the view that the world\u0027s second-largest economy is the danger he has depicted has yet to take hold of Europe in the way that fear of Russia, say, or Islamist extremism, has. That could be about to change.Salvini was already popular in Italy – at around 30 per cent, his party, the Lega, is more than twice as popular as the Five Star. Another party, the far-right Fratelli d\u0027Italia, has been steadily rising in the polls since well before the outbreak of Covi-19, and this is a further example of the direction in which the country is heading.One suspects that, when this dreadful episode is finally over, the Lega and the FdI will be the big winners politically from going after China and accusing it of being the party responsible  for the deaths of tens of thousands of Italians.Matteo Salvini after a meeting with Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, at the Chigi Palace It will also, one thinks, be crippling for Five Star after its close history with Beijing, but also for other left-wing parties, who for decades have preached globalism as the answer to ailing Italy\u0027s problems. It will be extremely difficult to continue to make that argument to a nation as badly stung as this, no matter how good it may be.But what must also be on the table now is how other countries will respond. Anti-Chinese sentiment has existed in Italy for a long time, for a number of reasons unique to the peninsula. But how will Spain, for example, with its equally horrific toll, or France, edging ever close to the Front National, respond?Despite China\u0027s rush to provide EU countries with aid, reports have already emerged from both Spain and the Czech Republic that the hundreds of thousands of coronavirus tests Beijing has delivered are not fit for purpose. That will do little to help China\u0027s already battered image. Europe\u0027s relationship with China was already set to be the major talking point, beside Brexit, for the next few years.

It’s a safe space. “We have sought to get eight chaplains with varying life experience, a we’re very aware of the current issues. For example, I’m a gay man and a priest in a church. And I would say that my experience is that there are times when the church has not been great with LGBTI people. “I think every church hopes that it’s great but sometimes that hope is not the reality of LGBTI people and so we want the church to be a safe place for everyone. “This chaplaincy is there because sometimes people have gone and not felt welcomed or respected. So as a diocese, we are putting something on to say we are here for you.”Rev Green said that other dioceses have previously had a volunteer chaplain helping LGBT people, but this is the first designated LGBT chaplaincy service in the UK, with a stronghold of eight volunteers offering pastoral support.“This is not a job for one person,” he added. “If you have a chaplain in Banbury and a gay perosn in Slough, what’s the use in that? We want volunteers across the diocese. Other dioceses are now getting in touch and asking us how it’s going, so we’re hoping our model will be replicated and rolled out.”The chaplaincy service held the first of its monthly LGBTI+ services at Christchurch Cathedral in Oxford, and had hoped for 40 congregants, but 100 showed up. Following the national lockdown, one of their new  LGBTI+ chaplains hosted the March service via podcast and assumed the role of preacher.Ross Meikle, one of the volunteer chaplains, said that the chaplaincy service has been “well-received and warmly appreciated” by those he and his colleagues have supported, and has even provided a “lifeline” to vulnerable congregants.“As a chaplain, I’ve been able to be in touch with a couple of people who have found it really helpful but especially in rural areas where the LGBT presence is less visible or in cases where people feel less comfortable talking to their vicars.“But now they know there’s a safe space for them where they know that they will be heard and respected, loved and cared for in that process. “For one of the people I have been in touch with, primarily over email, for him it’s been a lifeline. For some people, faith is something they have to work at and it doesn\u0027t feel as if God is there but knowing there are people he can turn to and email, as is the case for many LGBT people, is so important. “We’re not their counsellors or therapists. We’re there to make sure these people know they are loved. It’s the first one of its kids. This has been a really important and valuable step for a diocese to make.”   The Rt Revd Dr Steven Croft, the Bishop of Oxford, said that staff across the diocese are “committed to providing the highest standard of pastoral care to Christians”.   “Our trained volunteer chaplains are all set to listen and offer support to LGBTI+ people, their families and friends. It’s the first of its kind, and we hope it will be replicated in other dioceses. We also hope that it will give us a brand new opportunity to learn from the insights of LGBTI+ people about being church together.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 has spread fast us","story":"The United States now has the highest number of known cases of coronavirus in the world with more than 85,000, according to the latest figures.As of Friday, the US had overtaken Italy and China, where the Covid-19 virus began, to become the worst affected country.Asked about the latest figures at a White House briefing, President Donald Trump said it was a tribute to the amount of testing that we\u0027re doing.But why has the US seen so many cases?Mr Trump boasted this week that the US is doing more testing, with “quicker, better tests”, the “best tests in the world”, than any other country.This is only partly true:New York, which has now become the epicentre of the global outbreak, has carried out tens of thousands of tests in a matter of weeks.The state of New York is now recording nearly half the whole country’s total, with 40,000 of the 86,000 cases.Andrew Cuomo, its governor, said on Thursday that it had done 122,100 tests for its 19.5 million residents, or one test per 160 people. For comparison, South Korea, one of the best testers in the world, has carried out 300,000 for its 51 million population, or 1 in 170 people.In South Korea, there is free and easy access to testing for anyone whom a doctor deems needs it, and authorities have been tracing the contacts of infected patients.The picture countrywide, however, is a different one. Nationally, America has tested just 125 people per one million.States have been hit with testing shortages. The lack of kits and testing supplies has led to rationing of coronavirus tests in states like Georgia, Oklahoma and others.We are flying a plane in really foggy weather without radar,” is how one medical expert in Georgia described the situation.Mr Cuomo said New York has carried out 25 per cent of all tests in the country. It has 10 times the number of cases than the next nearest state, neighbour New Jersey.Los Angeles County has been carrying out an average of 500 per day, compared to New York’s capacity of up to 18,000.This suggests that the number of people with coronavirus in America is likely much higher than the official figure.Just look at the map below. New York has nearly 40,000 confirmed cases - half the total for the US, and dwarfing any other major US city.But is the problem just more exaggerated in the state because it is doing more testing? Yes and no.New York has been doing far more testing than any other state, but also if you look at the death toll - 461 - it is nearly six times higher than the next state - New Jersey, which has recorded 81.The stats suggest the problem is much worse in New York than other states. Why would this be?Density is one of the major problems working against it. New York is far more crowded than any other major city in the US. It has 28,000 residents per square mile, while San Francisco, the next most jammed city, has 17,000, according to data from the US Census Bureau. Millions of New Yorkers had until recently been using the subway system, whereas most residents of other cities, like Los Angeles and Washington, DC, drive. That spatial closeness makes us vulnerable, Mr Cuomo said in his daily press conference on Wednesday.Temperature is another factor in the differing rates between New York compared to LA for example, may be the warmer weather in Southern California, a climate that some early analysis suggests may slow the spread of the virus. Regions with average temperatures above 18 degrees Celsius account for fewer than six per cent of global cases so far, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Slow initial response. Mr Cuomo has won much praise for his cool and collected daily briefings, but New York was comparatively slow in enacting measures to help stop the spread. The state was days behind California in ordering schools to close and banning social gatherings.Tourism. New York City is a world-renowned tourist destination and the most visited destination in the US. As such, contagious people from countries that had earlier coronavirus outbreaks travelled to the city and spread the virus.Let’s look now at death tolls to see how lethal the virus has proved to be in the top three affected countries. China recorded a total of 81,897 cases and 3,292 deaths.As of Friday, the US recorded 85,996 cases and 1,304 deaths.Italy has so far recorded 80,589 and 8,215 deaths.The ratio is lowest in the US, however, the outbreak is not considered to have peaked yet here. Experts predict that the US could overtake China in terms of number of fatalities.On the Global Health Security Index, a report card that grades every country on its pandemic preparedness, the US has a score of 83.5—the world’s highest.But the US was slow to react to the outbreak. As you can watch in the video below, President Trump initially tried to downplay the problem, which led to a confusion between state and federal officials.The country then faced a testing shortage, despite being a biomedical powerhouse.As states report increasing numbers of patients, they have complained of a severe lack of masks and ventilation equipment in hospitals in the worst-hit areas.The US also has one of the lowest number of acute care hospital beds per 1,000 people in the developed world - just 2.2. Compare this with Japan, which has nearly eight and Germany, which has six.What is also concerning is the number of states - 15 out of 50 - which are reporting more than 1,000 cases.As testing increases across the US new hotspots have begun to emerge, including in Louisiana. The number of cases in New Orleans has increased by 30 per cent in 24 hours, up to 1,000.China essentially had one epicentre: Wuhan. South Korea initially had just Daegu. Italy has Lombardia and the UK has London. Multiple epicentres is a nightmare for any country. It makes it much more difficult to concentrate resources, but also to contain the problem.Experts have warned the mishandling of the pandemic could cost lives. “As an American, I’m horrified,” said Seth Berkley, who heads Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “The US may end up with the worst outbreak in the industrialised world.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2020/03/26/TELEMMGLPICT000228537332_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"doctors must make tough decisions whether elderly coronavirus","story":"The government’s former chief scientific adviser, Professor Sir David King, has urged people over 90 not to go into hospital because they are unlikely to survive and will overburden the NHS. It\u0027s fair to say this has been greeted with a degree of controversy. His words in an interview on Radio 4 were blunt, pointing out that “you go into hospital at that age with problems and you may never come out”. But his honesty will resonate with many - including healthcare staff and older people.Despite it being a new disease, the data on covid-19  is clear - older people, and those with serious medical conditions, such as heart disease, are most likely to come off the worst. Demand on the NHS is likely to exceed supply. It is likely to lead to tough decisions about who to treat - and who not to. Contrary to the assumptions of many, doctors cannot be forced into giving ineffective treatment. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation simply does not work for people whose bodies are frail and at the end of their natural lives. Intensive care is a highly invasive treatment which many do not survive. Many medical treatments have always been \u0027rationed\u0027 - from intensive care to transplants - based on rational consideration of who is most likely to benefit. The problem with covid-19 is that it will make these decisions starker.This is not an argument against giving people of whatever age the best treatment. But realistically, that best treatment may be comfort at home, rather than dying in a highly pressured hospital environment. Unless doctors articulate this, the risk is that patients will be given more treatment than they want, or can realistically benefit from, in an unfamiliar clinical environment. Which is potentially both unfair on the patient and an ethical issue - as it leaves fewer resources for people who could benefit from them.   We need to be practical. If hospital care cannot make someone better or more comfortable then they would have been at home, given the realities of this pandemic, the resources of hospitals should be kept for people who could. This might sound harsh. We also need a sense of proportion - most people who get covid-19 will have temporary symptoms and only a few will get seriously ill. But we are all mortal, and we should be open about the reality of death, whether from coronavirus or not. These discussions should not just happen behind closed doors. There needs to be transparency - for both patient and professional protection.Difficult decisions lie ahead. We have got better at talking about death but the coronavirus crisis has thrown a fuzzy subsconcious knowledge of our mortality into sharp relief. When Dr Kate Granger, who died in 2016, tweeted her experiences as she died of cancer, she wrote about the work that needed to be done in order to die peacefully. She had to organise drugs and equipment - prescriptions must be written, then dispensed, and then collected. As I write, several organisations are putting together guidelines for doctors and nurses to use to help people die well at home despite the complications of coronavirus. The risk of infection to others by the dying person will need to be factored and mitigated. Cure sometimes, treat often, comfort always holds true. My experience is that people who are already reaching the end of their natural lives usually want to have as few medical interventions and hospital visits as possible. The problem for medicine is that it treats death as a failure, rather than an inevitable reality. We all need to articulate what we do and don\u0027t want - and doctors must be honest about what is and is not possible.Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson asked US for ventilators, Donald Trump claimsHow does a coronavirus home test kit work, and how do I get one?What essential shops are open during the coronavirus lockdown?How many coronavirus cases are in your area?

Even compared to their Nordic neighbours, they are unequivocally non-conformist. True to form, Sweden is currently the only country in the Western world which appears to be handling the coronavirus with such restraint. Or at least, putting off extreme intervention for as long as possible.Sweden cannot take draconian measures that have a limited impact on the epidemic but knock out the functions of society, stated its public health secretary Johan Carlson last week, saying out loud what so many are thinking: That the horse has already bolted, a vaccine is probably 18 months away, the coming weeks and months will inevitably overwhelm national health systems, but that far more lives and livelihoods will be destroyed as a result of shutting entire industries than lives lost to this virus. This a disease, now all-but over in the country it hit first, that has killed 25,237 people worldwide over three months. Every year, mosquitoes kill 130,000 people over that same time-frame. Recessions kill too, albeit in a longer, more drawn-out ordeal - and that’s exactly what Sweden is so wary of. Sweden has currently recorded 3,046 cases of coronavirus compared to 3,687 in next door Norway. Since Norway entered lockdown two weeks ago, their unemployment rate has quadrupled. In Sweden, bars and restaurants have stayed open - table service only, to limit crowding - only gatherings of more than 50 have been banned, and schools remain in tact for under the 16s. Life there remains relatively normal.Will this country - so proud of its cool, calm, collected national identity - pay bitterly for this comparatively lax response in the weeks to come? That remains to be seen, but so far its government has been prepared to roll the dice or more specifically, to let its people decide for themselves what they\u0027re willing to sacrifice.To keep things up and running for as long as possible was certainly the sentiment of Boris Johnson - now himself a diagnosed coronavirus victim - before he bottled it and put the UK into full-blown lockdown last week. And that of Donald Trump, who has always put dollar signs front and centre of his decisions. Crude as he may be in his handling, the US president is trying, for the greater good of the economy, to limit the financial damage of this pandemic as much as possible, knowing full well that this will have human casualties. In Sweden’s case, it is surely not that the government cares less about its population than other European countries indeed this is one of the most welfare progressive nations on Earth. It is just being pragmatic.Forced to lay off 90 per cent of staff at its national airline SAS following the worldwide travel bans, authorities are now fast-track training those employees to take on temporary jobs in healthcare supporting doctors and nurses in basic administrative duties, sterilising equipment, and liaising between patients and their families. A genius redistribution of resources.Universities have closed but schools have stayed open for those under the age of 16, on the basis that older students can better manage remote learning, and judged on the too-high cost of taking at least a quarter of the country\u0027s workforce out of action to care for their perfectly healthy children. Not least the damage it would do to their kids\u0027 education most parents right now will tell you that home-schooling is hideously impractical.This is where Sweden has its priorities in check. Fairly early on, it became clear that this virus is unusually kind on young, healthy people, especially children, with only a handful of exceptions. Of course it makes sense for the elderly at high risk, many of whom are retired and don\u0027t contribute to the economy anyway, to stay behind closed doors. But to lock away everyone else? Looking at the numbers (the death rate for over 80s is about 14 per cent, for under 50s it’s 0.4 per cent, for under 40s it\u0027s 0.2 per cent, and so on until it reaches zero for under 9s), I myself would gladly risk re-entering society and contracting coronavirus. So long as I’m not mixing with high-risk iniduals - this obviously being crucial - shouldn\u0027t it be as much my choice as whether I wear a seatbelt or smoke cigarettes?It\u0027s perfectly possible I\u0027ve already had it. The more people we test, the more we see how widespread this disease really is and the less deadly it proves to be. Of the 800 coronavirus cases found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, a new report cited by the Japan Times this week found that four-fifths of those infected showed only mild symptoms, or none at all.  So we know not only that this pandemic has already infected hugely higher numbers of people than initially thought, but also that for the vast, vast majority of carriers - as with Boris and even Prince Charles - it\u0027s no worse than having a mild cold. Even my 85-year-old grandmother shudders at the amount of debt that awaits future generations - and these are her words not mine - all to keep thousands of oldies alive a little longer. Sweden, like the UK, may well bend to peer pressure in the very near future. For now, it is conducting an experiment in how much (or little) they can get away with when it comes to intervention, and the results will be key when we come through the other side. In the very likely event of a second wave come autumn, the UK, still licking its wounds, might well take a leaf out of Sweden’s book and look more soberly at the economic cost of this lockdown. It’s hard to see how we can afford it now. Surely we can’t do it all over again before the year is out.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

There is no shortage of food, just an excess of demand as people stock up. So far, at least.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen it comes to making sure everyone is fed, the front line of the fight is not in the pasta aisle at Tesco as shoppers scrap it out for the last pack of fusilli, but in fields up and down the country.British farmers warned this week of a coronavirus-induced labour shortage that could see millions of tonnes of strawberries, cabbages, apples, cauliflower lettuce and more rotting in the fields.‘Green lanes’ could ease shortages of fruit and veg to European shopsFor many years, the bounty of Britain\u0027s agricultural land has been picked and packed mostly by Eastern European hands. Work that years ago used to be the preserve of students making some extra money over the summer is now almost exclusively done by migrant labour.Some of those seasonal workers, mostly from Bulgaria, Romania, a few from Lithuania, are already in the UK but restrictions to stop the spread of Covid-19 mean there is a shortage of about 50,000 seasonal workers, presenting a serious problem for farmers.To plug the gap they have joined forces and launched a nationwide recruitment drive, calling on Britons to Feed the Nation by taking up seasonal roles in the fields. It\u0027s hoped that those who may have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis - chefs, retail assistants, waiters and others - will seize an opportunity for a very different kind of work.So acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its own Pick for Britain campaign taking inspiration from the Land Army that tilled the fields during the Second World War.\u0026nbspMost places are OK for labour at this point, but in six weeks we\u0027ll be picking, says James Porter, whose family owns East Scryne Farm, a soft fruit farm near Carnoustie, home of the storied golf course on Scotland\u0027s east cost.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If things drag on, the apple harvest could suffer as could vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, celery and cabbage.That would mean more imports of fresh fruit and vegetables. But other countries are experiencing their own problems. In Kenya, a major supplier of Europe\u0027s green beans and peas, Reuters reports that half of workers involved in growing and exporting have been sent home as flights are grounded and prices for freight rise.Spain is Europe\u0027s largest exporter of fruit and vegetables and a big supplier to the UK. But it too relies on thousands of migrant workers, many of them from Morocco, who have also been stranded at home due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.It\u0027s fair to say that British workers have turned their noses up at seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable surroundings.It\u0027s hard work and the Eastern Europeans are experienced at what they do, says Oliver Shooter, owner of AE Lenton, which runs a group of farms between Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire, the centre of England\u0027s vegetable production.It\u0027s not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys do, he says. A top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets\u0027 exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as how to cut it and pack it. For that they\u0027ll earn £12 an hour if they\u0027re good. Many farms also provide free or subsidised accommodation.The process is more high-tech than most would probably imagine, says Beverly Dixon, group HR director at G\u0027s, a network of large farms growing salad vegetables across East Anglia.We harvest our products in rigs, little mobile factories that go out into the field. They cut the veg at the front of the machine, it travels along a conveyor belt, gets trimmed, wrapped, boxed and put onto pallets all in one go, ready to be transported.Each rig is manned by a team of 16 who work as a family unit and will be kept apart from others as part of social distancing measures the farm is introducing.G\u0027s is looking for 700 seasonal staff, many of them pickers, but also jobs in packhouses and processing operations, team leaders, quality checkers, tractor drivers, bus drivers, forklift operators, some administrators and a handful of engineers.Bardsley, one of Britain\u0027s biggest apple producers, with an 850-hectare estate in Kent, says that in just a few days since the recruitment campaign launched the response has been overwhelming.Come July, when Bardsley starts harvesting 90 million apples - mostly Royal Gala, Braeburn, Cox\u0027s and the farm\u0027s prize-winning Bramleys - it will need some 500 extra workers. We\u0027ve put out the message on our social media saying \u0027come and join us\u0027, particularly to those people who unfortunately may be out of work at the moment. We are not slowing down, says marketing director Georgia Bardsley.We\u0027ve had such a erse range of people getting in touch. Among them are many who had until recently been working the hospitality sector that\u0027s been hit so hard by the coronavirus, including one head chef.Hopefully it gives people who have been affected a bit of hope, says Bardsley.The company\u0027s agricultural technology director, Antony Yousefian, says he\u0027s quietly confident the farm will find the people it needs. He also sees another potential positive to the situation.We\u0027ve seen a big change in consumers wanting to connect with what they eat in the last few years, he says. What a great opportunity for people to do that.I think, longer term, students will come back to doing this as a summer job.More and more of our jobs are higher skilled. We\u0027re hiring software engineers now, we\u0027ve got data analysts. So if you are a graduate, what a way to get into a farming business and apply yourself. In the day earn a bit of money and in the evening you might do some data analysis.Yousefian is currently building a digital map of the orchard to help the farm managers make better decisions by giving them real-time data on things like the climate, soil health and how much fruit is on the trees.The whole industry is changing. It\u0027s not a job that you turn your nose up at anymore.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But those are the headlines the difference lies in the details.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Employees (and employers) will have to wait until the end of April to get their money. For the self-employed, there’s no prospect of the cash coming in until “the beginning of June”.That’s a yawning gap of time for someone to go without income.Why the longer wait? Because the Treasury will have to establish an entirely new scheme to process claims from the self-employed.Officials will have to look at three years of declared self-employment tax returns so they can decide what the appropriate replacement income is for that worker, based on their average earnings.What of those who have only filed returns for one year or two? Officials will, apparently, use their discretion to decide on the right amount of compensation.And those who haven’t yet filed any tax returns at all?The chancellor made it clear they will, unfortunately, have to fall back on the welfare system, albeit one that has been made more generous in recent weeks. For some, that will mean a serious drop in income.And those self-employed who need cash now? They can try to access small-business loans. Or, again, there’s the unemployment benefits system safety net.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And they’ve swallowed a lot of late.It seems that Rishi Sunak wasn’t planning to do anything initially for the self-employed beyond boosting the benefits system.This was never tenable given the fact that this group of workers has grown so rapidly as a share of the workforce in recent years and that they are, on average, less well off than employees.In the past, many would actually have been regular employees but for the perverse incentives of the tax system and cost-cutting employers.Government support for low and middle-income employees but not the low and middle-income self-employed would have been manifestly unjust.The government has – rightly – come a long way in a short time on this.However, with joblessness already rising fast and businesses struggling with the support schemes already set up, it would be rash to bet against ministers having to go further still in the coming weeks of this crisis.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People are going to be waiting for help, likely until May or June as the bureaucracy to deal with this system is put in place.This risks pushing the self-employed into debt or will discourage them from staying at home even when they need to due to ill health.One of the key justifications for providing government funding for self-employed workers\u0027 earnings was to remove the financial incentive to go into work despite the risk of spreading coronavirus.Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, urged the government to introduce a dedicated hardship fund for self-employed people who are struggling while waiting for grants to be made.“Nearly every single call we are taking at our Business Debtline service is from self-employed people affected by the impact of Coronavirus, said Ms Elson.\u0026nbspThe electricians, plumbers and taxi drivers we are hearing from, who cannot work from home, are losing money by the hour – and telling them they can try and access Universal Credit is not enough.Accountants pointed to potential gaps in the new scheme. “The limitations do stand out, said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.There are quite a few gaps in the support: for people who have only recently started working for themselves or who pay themselves through idends, there may be no help at all.Payments will be calculated based on each worker\u0027s last three years\u0027 self-assessment tax returns.

It’s notably used by healthcare workers who need to avoid infection.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I want to thank @rihanna and the Rihanna Foundation for donating Personal Protective Equipment to New York State,” Cuomo tweeted.“We’re so appreciative of your help and that of so many others who have stepped up.”How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe message came a day before Cuomo gave a solemn address from New York City’s Jacob K Javits Concention Centre, which has been turned into a temporary hospital.New York could see a peak in the demand for hospital capacity in three weeks due to the coronavirus, and is planning to build a total of eight temporary hospitals to meet the surge, Cuomo said.Speaking against a backdrop of makeshift hospital beds, the governor also said schools should remain closed for another two weeks until 15 April.Cuomo\u0026nbsphas become a leading national voice on the coronavirus pandemic as the state has accounted for roughly one third of the national death toll and half the known number of cases.He said 44,635 people have tested positive in New York, up about 7,400 from Thursday, and that 519 New Yorkers have died from the virus, up from the previous day’s total of 385 deaths.Cuomo said the state was seeking to build another four temporary makeshift hospitals to add an additional 4,000 beds, which he called part of a plan B to try to make up for a shortage of medical resources.He plans to ask the White House to grant the request to build those additional resources.Additional reporting by ReutersThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People are going to be waiting for help, likely until May or June as the bureaucracy to deal with this system is put in place.This risks pushing the self-employed into debt or will discourage them from staying at home even when they need to due to ill health.One of the key justifications for providing government funding for self-employed workers\u0027 earnings was to remove the financial incentive to go into work despite the risk of spreading coronavirus.Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, urged the government to introduce a dedicated hardship fund for self-employed people who are struggling while waiting for grants to be made.“Nearly every single call we are taking at our Business Debtline service is from self-employed people affected by the impact of Coronavirus, said Ms Elson.\u0026nbspThe electricians, plumbers and taxi drivers we are hearing from, who cannot work from home, are losing money by the hour – and telling them they can try and access Universal Credit is not enough.Accountants pointed to potential gaps in the new scheme. “The limitations do stand out, said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.There are quite a few gaps in the support: for people who have only recently started working for themselves or who pay themselves through idends, there may be no help at all.Payments will be calculated based on each worker\u0027s last three years\u0027 self-assessment tax returns. People with fewer years self-employed will be assessed on the returns that are available.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mears is also providing direct assistance in shared accommodation to any person who presents with Covid-19 symptoms in order that they can self-isolate successfully.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “The safety and health of people in our accommodation services is of the utmost importance and new asylum seekers, who display coronavirus symptoms, are completing a minimum of seven days in self-isolation before entering mainstream asylum accommodation.\u0026nbsp“Asylum accommodation providers are applying Public Health England guidance and staff will instruct any symptomatic service user to self-isolate. Service users inside hostels who do not have symptoms can still move around the hostel and interact with each other.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, Mr Khan’s spokesman insisted ministers were told “countless times” that Tube frequencies reflect high levels of staff sickness and self-isolation.Shortly before 7am on Wednesday, a senior nurse named Danny posted on Twitter: “Another busy tube. Can we not stagger people’s start times so we aren’t all squashed on the same tube! This is unsafe and not fair!”Barry Trimble, who said his work involves ensuring cancer patients receive chemotherapy, posted an image of a busy Victoria line carriage shortly after 7am on Wednesday.“The Tube is packed, with social distancing impossible. We need more people to stay at home and more trains running in morning and evening peak.”The Tube is currently operating at around 50 per cent of its normal capacity during peak times. Transport for London\u0026nbsp(TfL)\u0026nbsphas pledged to “continue to run as much of a Tube service as we possibly can”.On Tuesday Mr Hancock said: “Transport for London should have the Tube running in full so that people travelling on the Tube are spaced out and can be further apart – obeying the two-metre rule wherever possible.“And there is no good reason in the information that I’ve seen that the current levels of Tube provision should be as low as they are.

The window being something that we look out on the world from.”Mr Lovekin said he hopes that his photography project will allow people to feel more connected to the outside world, despite being separated from one another for an unknown amount of time.\u0026nbspThe window, he said, was the perfect frame: “Something that we normally do not enter or exit from.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Beshear has ordered all non-essential retail businesses closed until the end of a state of emergency, which has also seen him activate the national guard.The governor’s tone remained even throughout his address, but he made clear that the circumstances of the new case had infuriated him.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your hands“My job in these press conferences is to talk to you about how we’re going to get through it — and we are — and that we’re going to do everything we can to protect the lives of those around us.“But this is one that makes me mad. And it should make you mad. Ultimately, the power of forgiveness — we get through this, we should forgive that person. But no more of these, anywhere, statewide, ever, for any reason.”The party seems to have been held by a group of young adults defying social distancing orders. Similar gatherings have been condemned in other states.In New York, now the epicentre of the US outbreak, a full lockdown has had to be imposed to stop people violating distancing rules. In Florida, meanwhile, CBS interviews showed young college students on spring break openly dismissing the risk of infection while drinking and mingling on the streets. “If I get corona, I get corona,” said one.Mr Beshear clearly has no truck with this behaviour. Laying the potential consequences uncompromisingly at the distancing-defiers’ feet, he had sharp words for them:“We are battling for the health, and even the lives, of our parents and grandparents. And don’t be so callous as to intentionally go to something and expose yourself to something that can kill other people.“We ought to be much better than that.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic.From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home.If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.Boris Johnson announced that these measures are in place for three weeks and they will be reviewed afterwards.This means they will be reviewed around April , which is the Easter bank holiday Monday.Theof the lockdown will depend on how the UK responds to the measures.If coronavirus cases and deaths drop, the lockdown could be lted when its next reviewed.While they will be reviewed in mid-April, the police currently have the power to enforce these measures for six monthsthe government deems it necessary.Residents are only now allowed to leave their homes for one of four essential reasons:Johnson said: You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No.You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can.If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that for a first offence, the fine will be £and for a second offence it will be £ .These fines will double with each offence.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The PM has ordered the closure of all non-essential shops, but he can ask businesses to do the same as well and stop people from going to work.Public transport also remains open to help key workers such as doctors and nurses but parts of this could be closed as well in future.Spain, Italy and France have been in national lockdown for a lot longer than the United Kingdom with those three countries badly affected by coronavirus.Italy has now banned all movement inside their country and closed non-essential businesses as the spread of coronavirus continues.This comes after  people died in the country on Saturday, March , and  more the following day in a frightening weekend. France went into lockdown on March  with police currently patrolling the streets to ensure people only leave their homes for essential reasons.Spain is in a state of emergency and plans to extend that for another  days.There are tough restrictions in place in badly-effected areas such as Madrid with all educational institutions forced to close.Unlike in the UK, where people are allowed to exercise freely, this is not the case in these three Mediterranean countries.French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said: Going out to take the children for a walk or for physical exercise must be within a distance of one kilometre maximum of your home, for one hour, and obviously alone, once a day.In Spain, residents are only allowed outside for shopping or to walk dogs while in Italy all parks have been closed and people can only exercise around their homes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But as the disease relentlessly spreads and deaths soar, it will not cope without a monumental national effort of a kind not seen for  years.The exhausted doctors and nurses on the frontline, dealing with stricken or recovering patients, now need the support of an army of , volunteers. If you are in good health and unable to work, why not join them It has been moving beyond measure to witness the , retired or former medics, nurses and pharmacists rejoining the NHS to fight this disease.They could be safe at home. Instead they have put themselves in harm’s way. That takes great courage and public spirit. MPs may not be popular these days, but those workers include Tory Maria Caulfield and Labour’s Dr Rosena Allin-Khan. We salute both.And we wish luck to the , final-year doctors and , student nurses who, at the very start of their careers, are tasked with tackling the gravest public health crisis in a century.They and all their colleagues should know, from the thousands of “I Love NHS” messages pouring into us from Sun readers, how grateful the nation is.Millions are doing their bit just by staying home. Many are going the extra mile to help friends, neighbours and OAPs who are self-isolating. Some, with their own jobs in peril, have poured money into good causes close to ruin.For their part, some of our businesses are repurposing factories to produce ventilators and other vital supplies.Now, the Government is asking every one of us to volunteer for the NHSwe can. Together we can help the health service beat this virus and restore some semblance of normality while minimising casualties. And it is desperately urgent.As the latest heartbreaking death toll shows, this crisis is likely to get much worse before it gets better. THE eerie, deserted streets tell their own story. Britain has begun to listen and obey.More than  million of us watched Boris Johnson’s stark, historic address to the nation — among the highest TV audience figures ever. And it hit home.Yes, there were still some crammed carriages on London’s depleted Tube yesterday. There is still confusion over some of the guidance and rules — and more clarity would be welcome.But there WILL be mistakes and inconsistencies from the Government. It is having to react minute by minute to a sudden, global catastrophe. It cannot cover off every inidual situation. We all have to use our common sense too.The vast majority of people get that. They back the PM and the lockdown and are grimly but calmly sticking by it.We are reacting with fortitude. Let’s keep that going.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were high on euphoria and expectation before the inevitable responsibilities and occasional disappointments of adult le set in.For me, it meant a week in Tywyn, Wales, in the caravan of my friend Mandy’s mum and dad, followed by a summer job in Littlewoods and Sundays spent hanging around the local rec with my mates while passing round a warm, spittle-filled bottle of budget cider.Ah, those were the days. Today’s kids are more likely to be drinking canned Pinot Grigio at an American-style prom party before heading off on a family holiday to Spain, but the sense of closure they feel at the end of exams is exactly the same. It’s a rite of passage.So for all those GCSE and A-level students for whom Covid- has put paid to that “end of exams” feeling, I have nothing but the utmost sympathy.Last Wednesday I was on a dog walk with my youngestwhen news came in that her GCSEs were off.It’s tempting to think that she and the rest of Class  might have whooped with joy at this unprecedented cancellation of national exams, but that would be to sorely underestimate the level of pressure placed on their generation to get a qualication that will elevate them out of the in-tray of le and into paid employment.Like the Olympic athletes who’ve spent the past few years training for that one event in Tokyo that has been postponed until next year, our kids have been preparing for exams that their parents and teachers have drummed into them are so critically important to their future.So forgive them , despite the deaths that give perspective to the little things that many of us find frustrating about this plague on all our houses, they allow themselves a spell of feeling deeply sorry for themselves.They will now be given “predicted” grades — though the Government is still frustratingly vague on the exact detail of how they will be decided upon.There has been some suggestion that mock results might be a factor but, let’s face it, they’re rarely taken seriously at the time and never match the grades kids get in the real thing. So let’s hope they come up with something fairer.Either way, it’s going to be potentially fraught with pitfalls.“I wanted to earn my grades,” the youngest said, plaintively, the other day. “Now I feel like all my hard work has been for nothing.”I reassured her that, one day, knowledge such as “changes to Tanzania’s economy through private and foreign investment” , “the formation of polyesters through the reaction between dicarboxylic acid monomers and diol monomers”and “parallel and collinear vectors”might come in handy when, ten years from now, she’s at a pub quiz. Or maybe not.Which brings me to my final point on this unprecedented cancellation of GCSEs and A-levels.The latter are fine as they are, but perhaps those in the upper echelons of education could use this time of isolation to take a long, hard look at GCSEs and whether they are fit for purpose in the modern world Most kids know their subject strengths and weaknesses by the time they’re  so, aside from basic maths and English, which prove useful whatever your chosen employment, do they really need their heads crammed with often obscure information that,needed in later le, they could simply look up on Google Better, surely, to teach them vital le skills such as entrepreneurialism, money management, how to compose an impressive CV and do well in job interviews Like a reverse version of a minute’s silence, it’s to show our hard-working NHS staff how much we appreciate their efforts at this deeply challenging time.So whether you do it in a garden balcony windowbox or post it live on social media, put your hands together and show that we care about them too.MADONNA has posted an, er, inspirational Instagram video of herself ponticating on the Covid- plague while luxuriating in a bath full of rose petals.Her Madgeness declares: “That’s the thing about Covid-. It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell.“It’s the great equaliser and what’s terrible about it is what’s great about it.”Hmmmm. Nice sentiment, but the reality of self-isolation for the majority brings to mind the famous quote from George Orwell’s Animal Farm. “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”Be it the Queen Of Pop, with her vast mansion and multi-million dollar nest egg to see her through these trying times, or The Queen with her “skeleton staff of eight” – being in lockdown is far nicer when you’re wealthy.But when there’s loads of you in a pokey space and with no discernible means of paying next month’s rent, it’s not so “great”. GOVERNMENT advice on who should be doing what and when is still a little woolly.And where there’s potential loopholes there are those who will either misunderstand or willfully exploit them.Step forward Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley who, post-lockdown, told his staff they should turn up for work before being publicly shamed in to telling them to stay home after all.But with cycle shops being allowed to stay open, he could perhaps mitigate that as he’s in the business of sports equipment, he thought the same rule applied to his business too.­Similarly, while the building work on one house near me has ceased, another is still ongoing with at least eight construction workers – all of whom will have either shared a van or taken public transport to get there.So one suspects the Government is going to have to ramp up the “lockdown” rhetoric to make it clearer exactly what is deemed essential and what’s not.Meanwhile, I’m going to exploit this small pocket of vagueness by hopping on my bike and heading to the local pharmacy for a packet of hair dye, not least because it comes with a handy pair of disposable gloves.As the Donald Trump meme shows above, no one wants to see that much harsh reality.THE closure of McDonald’s prompted s of people to queue round the block for one last Big Mac.They shouldn’t worry.Given that a man in Utah claims to own the world’s oldest McDonald’s burgerand it shows no sign of decay.All those desperate McAddicts could have bought  of them and they’d still be edible at Christmas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has just taken this crisis to give us all a wake-up call to realise what is most important — our family, our friends and our fellow human beings.In my street we have set up a WhatsApp group so we can all help each other out getting shopping, medicine and simply checking to seeeveryone, especially the elderly and those living alone, are doing OK.And tens of thousands of you have heeded the Government’s call and volunteered to help deliver medicines and supplies to vulnerable patients on lockdown.I have signed up to have a chat with anyone who needs a bit of reassurance.Cab drivers are giving pensioners free transport.

Cross-contamination is rampant. The animal cruelty is off the scale.Bears, tigers,  wolf cubs, crocodiles, hedgehogs and turtles are not spared in this notorious wildle food trade, either.Now the despicable wet markets used by some Chinese people — markets already responsible for the Sars outbreak in  — have finally brought the world to its knees.Scientists have established that it is highly likely Covid- was linked to a notorious live animal market in Wuhan.Gene sequencing analysis shows the new coronavirus probably started in bats and was transferred to humans via the scaly anteater the pangolin.So why is there so little outrage about the wet markets that we know have the potential to cause catastrophic outcomes to human health Even Donald Trump — slammed for branding Covid- the “Chinese virus” — avoided criticising the wet markets when prompted during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday.Maybe that’s because the moment someone tries to speak up they are accused of racism.That happened to reality star and retail entrepreneur Luisa Zissman earlier this week when she posted a video on Instagram of a wet market and called for them to be “banned completely”.After the usual social media outrage, she told me: “I wholeheartedly disagree with this particular part of Chinese culture, but that does not make me racist.” It should be remembered there are many campaigners within China desperately trying to get the wet markets banned too.After all, the addition of more exotic animals only dates back to the s, as the ruling communist party struggled to feed the population and million people perished in what became known as the great famine.By , the ironically named Wildle Protection Law encouraged industrial-level breeding of the likes of bears, bats and turtles to be sold through wet markets. And that’s when the viruses began to form.When the Sars crisis was linked to a wet market in southern China, officials shut it down and made wildle farming illegal. But they reversed the decision just a few months later.As of  it was a £billion industry, mainly because the rich and the powerful pay copious quantities of money to eat rare wildle as they believe  claims about their role in Chinese medicine.Now with coronavirus spreading, the government has again temporarily banned wildle trading and shut down wet markets.But it’s not permanent yet — and it must be.We already know that the early Chinese cover-up of Covid-, which makes Chernobyl look like a misdemeanour, resulted in the disease’s rapid spread.In fact,China had taken early action experts reckon the number of coronavirus cases could have been cut by  per cent, making its rampage all over the globe far less likely.The new illness was directly linked to the infamous wildle market in Wuhan on December , but it wasn’t until New Year’s Eve that the World Health Organisation was informed and the site closed.The brave Chinese doctors who tried to spread the word about Covid- were shut down by the authorities too, and early testing was stopped and samples  destroyed.I have no doubt the Chinese government has blood on its hands over coronavirus.And saying that now, at the peak of the health crisis, is not the time to tackle the issue is wrong.We must have this uncomfortable discussion while our anger is raw and the pain  all too real.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.I DON’T have enough superlatives to describe my adoration for Lady Gaga.No pop star of her generation has been more consistently savvy, smart or, for that matter, talented.So it pains me to so deeply disagree with her decision to delay the release of her highly anticipated new album Chromatica, which was due to drop on April , in the middle of quarantine hell.In fact, I actually think the delay is quite selfish.Thanks to the technological advances in streaming, listening to new music is one of the few activities we can engage in collectively without having to leave the house. Gaga wrote that: “It just doesn’t feel right to me to release this album with all that is going on during this global pandemic.”Instead she wants us all to focus on “finding solutions”, such as providing medical equipment and school meals.All very good aims, of course.But what the world also needs now is music, sweet music, to unite us and, frankly, distract us.She’s also made a strategic error, given she had a captive audience with time on their hands at home to stream to their heart’s content.This is the time for the UK to show that, eight decades on, we still have the Blitz spirit in our blood.Many of our parents or grandparents were sent to the front line to fight Hitler.All most of us have to do is put our lives temporarily on hold while scoffing Domino’s pizza and watching Netflix.I don’t for a second underestimate the signicance of such a call, by the way.These are dark days and there is a growing coronavirus-shaped cloud over our daily lives right now, causing extreme stress and anxiety.It’s so easy to feel angry and uncertain and tearful and depressed.Like you, I’ve been through the gamut of emotions while practising social distancing.However, that is simply not an excuse not to try to  carry on with your normal lives.It won’t be for ever. In fact, the sooner we do this properly, the sooner this nightmare will be over.At such a trying time it is imperative we celebrate the brilliant work being done by so many to keep society running.So thank you to the doctors, the nurses, the NHS workers, the first responders, the supermarket staff, the cleaners, the bus drivers, the Tube staff, the delivery drivers, the journalists and anyone  who NEEDS to keep working to keep our society going.They’ll thank the rest of us for doing our part too and staying indoors.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today, he busts some myths surrounding the coronavirus – and gives tips on how everyone can help to prevent its spread . . .Q: I’ve heard hot drinks can kill the virus. Is this correct A: There is absolutely no truth whatsoever in that, unfortunately. People are reading all sorts of information and perhaps they have got this from the fact the virus is affected by high temperatures. But hot drinks would have no effect on the virus in the eyes and nose, which is often where it gets in. There is also no evidence hot drinks could prevent the virus or make it more mild.Q: Will the UV light from the sun help stop the coronavirus A: Ultraviolet light can weaken and kill the virus because UV radiation can destroy lots of microorganisms. That is why it is OK for people to go out in the fresh air and exercise — but not in groups of more than two people from the same household. Butyou already have the virus in your nose and throat UV light won’t have any effect.Q: You said you shouldn’t take ibuprofen. Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties too. Is it still safe to eat it A: Herbs such as ginger and garlic do have anti-inflammatory properties but the effects are so mild they would not have an appreciable effect. There is no reason to avoid culinary herbs.Q. If I get the virus, what should I do A: Stay at home and self-isolate for seven daysyou live alone or for  daysyou live with other people. Treat your symptoms as you would with any other upper-respiratory infection. Take paracetamol to help bring down your temperature, use cough medicine to help ease your cough, use lozenges or a spray for your sore throat, andyou have a bunged-up nose, use a decongestant. Drink plenty of fluids.Q. Should I still take my child for their routine vaccination A: Yes, you should still take your child. Routine immunisations continue to protect children from all the usual infections. They are being held in a safe clinical setting.Q. I am heavily pregnant and due to have my baby in hospital in a few weeks. Is this still safe A: Antenatal and obstetrics care is continuing. All midwery teams are taking every precaution for services to continue as normal. No one needs to be frightened going into hospital to have a baby. Hospitals are a safe clinical environment and you will be discharged as soon as is appropriate and practically possible.Q: We are waiting on a cancer diagnosis for our daughter. Will they delay starting treatment because of the virus A: No. Serious and emergency treatments will continue despite the virus outbreak. This cannot be postponed.Q: The streets are now full of runners and some push past me on the pavement. Can they pass the virus through their sweat A: This is a respiratory virus, transmitted through droplets in the air we breathe out and through sneezing. Our hands can be contaminated and when we put our hands to our face that’s how the virus gets into the body. Sweat and blood are not thought to transmit the virus.Q: I’ve always had a weak immune system and I seem to catch everything going. How much at risk am I A: There is no evidence that people who are prone to catching ordinary colds are more susceptible to coronavirus. Just take the necessary precautions and keep on physically distancing from others.Q: I ride a motorbike. Is there any reason I can’t A: In theory there is no reason why you can’t continue to ride. But the main risk is of you getting injured and requiring hospital treatment. Certainly, the last thing we want to do is overload the NHS with injuries that can be avoided so keep the consequences of what you do in mind.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q: My husband is a self-employed gardener working on his own. Is he safe to go to do someone’s garden when he has no contact with the people A: While it sounds very strict, the Government’s advice is now clear. That is that everybody should stay at home unless their work is absolutely essential. Evenyour husband’s work involves travelling by car on the road, needing to fill up with petrol for example, that increases human-to-human contact, which is how the virus is transmitted.Q: I’m  and a volunteer driver for cancer patients. Is it safe for me to still be doing my voluntary work A: While you do a wonderful job, your age puts you in the vulnerable category and you should stop doing what you’re doing. We now have more than , NHS volunteer responders who will all be younger than you and can take up this kind of work. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

either positive or negative - within as little as two and a half hours.At the moment, most of the commonly used tests take at least  hours to deliver a result following laboratory analysis.Dr Jochen Rupp, a Bosch product manager, told the : “It’s all automatic – stick in the swab and seal it – and it saves interminable transportation routes.“It’s very simple and, with minimum manual work, the doctor gets the result direct, day or night – negative or positive – and can react directly and quickly.”The device can also dferentiate between coronavirus and nine other infections that cause similar symptoms, such as seasonal flu.Its already in use at clinics near Boschs headquarters in Stuttguart and will be made more widely available in Germany next month.There are also plans to distribute the technology - which was created in just six weeks with help from Northern Irish diagnostics company Randox Laboratories - across the rest of Europe.Marc Meier, managing director of Boschs healthcare ision, said: We have succeeded in developing an innovative test in a very short time, which can contribute to curbing the global spread of the coronavirus.The particular quality of the Bosch test is that through its dferential diagnostics doctors can spare themselves the time they would otherwise spend on further testing.The company refused to say how much each test would cost or how many machines it would manufacture. It also failed to specy its tests  positive rate - which means the number of samples that are wrongly identied as containing coronavirus.Boschs Vivalytics device relies on very similar methods to other tests - polymerase chain reactions, also known as molecular photocopying.When a swab is taken from a patient, the strands of genetic material are copied, passed through a detector and compared against other genetic sequences.Germany is carrying out , coronavirus tests a week, which is the equivalent of more than , of the devices operating for  hours a day.In the UK, testing is being carried out at a much lower rate of around , a day.Last week the test numbers topped , but then fell to a low of ,.As of am yesterday, a total of , people have been tested, of which , were confirmed negative and , were confirmed positive.The government has promised that tests for current viral infection, will reach ,.It also announced that it had bought . million antibody tests which can determine whether someone has already had coronavirus.When a person gets infected by the virus, the body starts making specially designed proteins called antibodies to fight the infection.The new finger-prick test looks for these specic antibodies in the blood to determine whether that person is immune.Once the tests are available, NHS staff and key workers -

It won’t be the last case.As this thing grows, we’re going to get more health workers exposed, just like in Italy, because they’re on the front line.It’s very easy to be gloomy and doom-mongering about the pandemic, but overall I have a sense of optimism.We’ve got some tough weeks ahead, we know that, but in the long-term we’ll come through this crisis.General Practice will also have learned some new ways of interacting with patients that will probably make the NHS better in the long term too.Doctors have learned how to do video consultations so hopefully we’ll see less of the queues outside surgeries on a Monday morning.And last night’s applause was great too. It made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck.It feels like the NHS has the support of the nation.Kirsty Gage, , is a childminder from Kettering, Northamptonshire.

It seems really unfair. There are other ways I can prove my income.I do monthly invoices for parents, we have proof of bank transfers and contracts.I was a teacher for four years so I’ve always paid my dues. It’s really disappointing.I tried applying for Universal Credit but when you try and upload the necessary documents, it crashes because the site is overloaded.I tried ringing and left a message. I managed to talk to the mortgage company and they said we could freeze our mortgage for three months but there would be extra charges and they can’t tell us what they are yet.Now I’m worried that whatever they charge will put us in a trickier position long term.They should have sorted this by now, because it’s more uncertainty for us.I’ve lost £, a month in income and I feel really let down.”Shannon Summerfield, , is a support worker with not-for-profit Dimensions in Cardf.

I was outside and there were fireworks going off and pots and pans.We didn’t knowpeople would take it seriously and go out and actually do that. To hear those people clapping was really, really nice.I do feel a lot better than I did at the beginning of the week – I still think the lockdown was the right thing to do.I hope people will stick to what’s being said and what’s being expected of them. People are working very hard for the NHS.I just hope it doesn’t go on too much longer.My mum, a nurse, had some news yesterday – she might be working on a coronavirus ward.She might have to stay in a hotel to keep me and my sister safe. I wasn’t too happy because obviously I can’t see anyone as it is, and my mum is always there.She might be working with people who’ve tested positive and keeping them safe.Because she works shts it might mean I don’t see anyone in my own house for days. It’s quite hard.That’s why I hope people stick to the lockdown rules – so I can have her home sooner with me.Raegan Drew, , is a funeral director for the Co-op Funeralcare in Edinburgh.She says: It was a bit hectic at the start of the week, with all the changes we had to make, but thankfully there’s been no further changes since Monday so it’s quite calm at the moment.We now have all the correct information to pass on to clients, so it’s all fine.If there is a peak on coronavirus deaths, I am confident we can cope. We’re as fully prepared as we can be and none of us really know what’s round the corner.Hopefully the measures Boris Johnson has put in place will help the numbers stay down.The lockdown is being well observed and everyone is being so considerate, phoning aheadthey need to come in, or conducting everything by phone.Yesterday, my colleague Clare had a client bring in a goody bag for her, full of sweets and juice.She said, ‘I know you’ve had some dficult calls to make this week and you’ve been great, so I wanted to give you a little treat.’Clare was quite emotional about it and I thought that was lovely.We’ve had so many clients expressing their appreciation across the board which means a lot.The clap for the NHS, last night, was a really emotional gesture too.I meet a lot of NHS staff in my work and they do an amazing job.

For me, because I have some savings, I’m covered for now.But for a lot of guys, this is going to force them back out and working, it’s a battle between morals and looking after yourself money wise.I’ve got the option – but some people don’t. If you live your le pay packet to pay packet, this is going to be very tough.I’ve got one friend who went self-employed in the middle of last year, so he’s not done a taxyet.Now he’s not working because he’s got a daughter at home – he’s in a real mess.”Gemma Woodall, , works as a primary school teacher in the village of Holme-on-Spalding-Moor in Yorkshire.She says: We only have five kids in today.

You wanted to make them normal.I’m so glad the people saw through your destructive policies at every election you fought. Unbelievable.And fellow Tory MP Alicia Kearns mocked: Corbyn fails to understand even the basics.The Labour leaders claims were also dismissed by leading economists.Ploughing huge sums into saving , lives and millions of jobs is not some lesson the Tories learned from Corbyn, no matter how tragically ­desperate he is for a “legacy”. It is what a government should do, but only when faced with a le-or-death situation. It is not a sane strategy for normal times.What the old dunce cannot grasp is that such gargantuan bailouts will need to be paid back by years of tax rises and further austerity. If he wants credit for the spending, will he also accept responsibility for that future hardship No, we didn’t think so.Corbyn will be remembered as Labour’s worst-ever leader, the architect of their most abject defeat in  years. He drew anti-Semites like flies to dung. He repelled decent Labour MPs and voters.Only leftie cranks and Tories will miss him.Julian Jessop from the Institute of Economic Affairs said: As usual, he’s missing the point.The current increase in Government spending is only a temporary stopgap until the emergency health measures can be removed and the market economy rebooted again.In contrast, Labour was proposing a permanent increase in the size and role of the state.The costs of the inidual measures being taken today are still relatively small compared to many of Labour’s proposals.

He has been a calming influence with his reassuring and authoritative advice. Here are his latest answers to your questions.Q: I’ve been told to isolate for  weeks as I’m in a high-risk group. I’ve been told I can open a window but can I sit in my garden A: You can open the window and you can sit in your back garden because you are not having any contact with other people who could potentially transmit the virus to you. Twelve weeks is a long time to isolate and you need fresh air and a change of scenery from being inside.Q. I work in an NHS admin and clerical outpatient department. Is it essential for me to be in work A: Despite the coronavirus outbreak, many patients still need to go to hospital for treatments, tests and check-ups. Therefore, their appointments and medical records need to be correct as usual. You are still an important cog in the big NHS wheel but check with your line manager and keep that two metre distance from patients and colleagues.Q. My son-in-law had a letter to say he should isolate due to underlying health conditions but his boss says he must keep working andhe doesn’t, he won’t get paid. Is it safe for him to go into work A: If your son-in-law has this letter, he should abide by it for his own protection. Most employers are being responsible but this one needs to be more sympathetic and check Public Health England guidance.Q. My we has multiple sclerosis and I have diabetes. Should we self-isolate for  weeks A: Neither of you are in the highest risk group but you are vulnerable. You aren’t being told to isolate butyou can it will be safer. Keep social contact to a minimum and get food deliveredpossible.Q. Even though we are in partial lockdown are we putting off the inevitable  Are we all going to get the virus eventually A: It is by no means inevitable that we will all be exposed to the virus and come down with its symptoms. This has never happened in previous pandemics. A proportion of the population will get it but, with lockdown, we are protecting many people from it especially the most vulnerable, which is what we need to do. The hope is that as more people become immune the prevalence of the virus in the population will diminish and reduce transmission to those who have not had it.Q. I am on naproxen twice a day for hip arthritis. Should I stop taking it as it is an immunosuppressant A: Naproxen is a useful medication for arthritic pain and works as an anti-inflammatory. There is some evidence that anti-inflammatories reduce the body’s response to fighting the virus whereas other painkillers like paracetamol do not. Much depends on how much pain you are in. If you are unlucky enough to get the virus, the effect is probably only marginal, so don’t worry too much.Wish I could come back and join you but I’m now classed as “vulnerable”. Gwen Giles, Ewhurst GreenThank you so much for everything you are doing. James PinnegarPlease take care of your-selves as you take care of your patients. Bella DjiboutiYou are amazing people and we are proud. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Vandra Lough, GlasgowQ. I am a manager of a convenience shop providing the community with what they need. We have not been given gloves or any Personal Protection Equipment. Is there anything I should do to keep myself and my staff safe A: Ensure that you have plenty of hand sanitiser and encourage staff to wash their hands frequently. Keep customers two metres apart from your staff, including when they are behind the till. Tell them to step away from customers when they pay and put the items in their bags.Q. I read in the paper about a -year-old man who had coronavirus and how his family think the medication he took for a suspected water infection may have played a part in his recovery. Could this be true A: There is no medication in use for other current infections that is recommended at the moment as a general treatment for the virus.Q. I am -weeks pregnant. Should I work until my maternity leave or self-isolate A: You should work from homepossible. Pregnant women should stay at home because they are in the vulnerable group. It is recommended you do this now, don’t wait.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve been wasting my le really, so I’ll stay in bed.”Everyone thinks their job is important, so everyone went to work, and this meant that in London especially, the public transport system was rammed full of commuters. This made everyone very angry.I don’t want to blame anyone for what’s going on. If you shut a country down overnight there are bound to be issues.

It’s a means of transport that’s virus proof.You can’t be infected when you’re inside it and you can’t pass your infection on to anyone . It’s called the “motor car”.For years, successive leaders and politicians have done their best to squeeze it out of society.They’ve lowered the speed limits and raised the taxes and ­introduced congestion charging and even suggested, hilariously, thatyou ­absolutely must have one, it should have an electric motor.

I know this flies in the face of what the eco-mentalists say is good for us but buses are petri dishes so park them at the depot.Trains and the Tube are no better, so turn off the power immediately. In the last three months of last year, million people in this country had jobs. And that’s handy because at the last count there were million cars registered for use on the road.This means that everyone can get to their place of work, safely, in a virus-proof cocoon. Strange isn’t it. For years we were told that cars would one day kill us all. But now it’s obvious that actually, they are our knights in shining armour.I only ask because the phone she was using looked like it was from about .Who was she calling  Dial-a-Disc WHILE scrolling through my phone the other day I was interested to read that I could increase my immunity to coronavirus by taking more vitamin C.Then I was told I would not catch itI stared for two hours every day at a picture of Charlize Theron.Later, I received news from someone whose neighbour’s aunt lives next door to a doctor’s cleaning lady that I should drink my own urine.But I was quickly distracted by someone  whose hairdresser had hacked the World Health Organisation and found that under no circumstances should I eat anything containing vitamin C. Or look at Ms Theron.And then I remembered something Important. Every single thing on the internet is b******s.But there’s one small problem.How do you reach anything on the shelves AS I write, the whole world is trying to work out why Germany is doing so much better with the coronavirus than everywhere .The bald figures are certainly intriguing. In Britain, . per cent of people who catch the disease go on to die. In Italy, it’s a terrying nine per cent. Whereas in Germany, it’s . percent.Experts have claimed that the epidemic started there in the Baian Alps, so the people it affected were young, fit skiing enthusiasts. Who barely noticed they had it.Others have pointed to the fact that Germany has many more beds for critically ill patients than Italy. And a HELL of a lot more than the UK.Then there’s testing. For months German medics have been testing the sort of numbers the rest of the world can only dream about. I wonder, however,anyone has considered this: The Germans do well . . .  because they are German.I was once told by a professor at Rome University that: “You can have as many laws as you like in Italy. Just so long as they are not enforced.”So, when the government there first told everyone to go home and stay there, they simply carried on riding around on their Vespas and kissing everyone.It’s the same story in Britain. We were told to stay at home but because the sun was out, we all hit the park for a picnic.The Germans are dferent. You tell Wolfgang that he must wash his hands every  minutes and he will wash his hands every  minutes. You tell him to go home and he will do so, immediately.It’s probably considered racist to talk about national characteristics these days. But in these troubled times I’m going to plough on regardless and say thatwe want to survive, we’ve got to be a bit more German. And for once, do as we are told.Which I’m told is an important ­ingredient in a building project.WE keep being told that the supermarkets will be able to keep up with our demand for food. But I seriously doubt that.I was told this week that the supplier providing my farm with veg seeds had closed. And because he had no delivery drivers, he was dumping his stock.I’ve now found a replacement and I will be getting them in the ground next week. But who will harvest them in three months, when the people who normally do this kind of thing are stuck in Latvia  Students  Fat chance.To make matters worse, a lot of peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and courgettes you buy come from Spain.And who, right now, in this locked-down country, is planting them, and packing them and taking them to the docks or the airport  Still, there is some good news.Vegetarians will be forced to abandon their idiocy and start to eat meat. Lamb looks like a good bet. Because all the restaurants and pubs are shut, and exports are tricky, prices have more than halved in the past seven days.Bloody annoying for me as a sheep farmer.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Any other suggestions for box sets gratefully received.I’M sure all dog owners would agree that our fantastic, loyal, loveable pets are keeping us sane right now. I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

Business minister Alok Sharma repeated claims the UK government did not join the EU’s ventilator scheme because it didn’t get the email.It came after Number  was forced to deny the government was putting Brexit ahead of British lives after they said they hadn’t joined the scheme because the UK had left the EU. Later they insisted that the email from the bloc had gone to the wrong address.  Mr Sharma said “there was an issue in terms of communication so the tendering process had already started” and he suggested the UK could have joined saying “We would have had to look and see the precise details of that.” The EU insist the UK was fully briefed on the joint procurement plans which are designed to allow the states to order at scale and cheaply.  They have been publicly highlighted by commission president Ursula von der Leyen and other senior Brussels officials in recent weeks. Ms von der Leyen said this week that the first call for tender, which covered protective equipment and brought together  countries, had led to “concrete offers of considerable scale on shortest notice”.  “This is EU solidarity in action. It shows that being part of the union pays off,” she said. And Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted last week that he was aware of the project, and claimed Britain was involved.

Researchers also believe the peak of the outbreak could be as soon as a week from Sunday.Prof Tom Pike, of Imperial College London, said: “Social distancing is working against Covid- as aneffective parachute across multiple countries.“That’s no reason for us to cut away our parachutes when we’re still way above the ground.”The lower figure would mean the UK losing fewer people to coronavirus than seasonal flu.Experts insist their strategy is working , but warned it will take time to see the effects of the social distancing.

Have you been affected by the coronavirus  Email webnews@trinitymirror   Regional mortuaries may close to free up staff to work at the airport facility. The West Midlands has emerged as a hotspot for people testing positive for the coronavirus. Latest official data recording deaths of those who had contracted Covid- showed that  of the  people who died in the most recent period - % - had come from the region. Sandwell politan Borough Council has been co-ordinating scoping, on behalf of all West Midlands and Warwickshire local authorities, to find possible sites for temporary mortuary space. Other sites, including one in Rugby, Warwickshire, and the NEC itself, had been suggested as possible locations, before the option to use the airport site became available. The sprawling airport site includes a vast cargo hub, with several large hangers on the opposite side of the airstrip from its two main passenger terminals. The Government is making £. billion available to councils to deal with pressures on existing services from responding to coronavirus.  The plans are being co-ordinated on behalf of councils in Wolverhampton, Dudley, Walsall, Sandwell, Birmingham, Coventry, Solihull and across Warwickshire. Deputy leader of Sandwell Council Wasim Ali said: In reality, we have to prepare for the worst as local councils. Weaposve seen the numbers of deaths just keep rising. If it does get to that point, we have to be prepared. Itaposs a big logistics operation, so we have to take that decision to start the planning. He added: We really donapost want to have to use it, butwe do, then itaposll be available.  Mr Ali said a plan is needed because municipal mortuaries could run out of space. The back-up mortuary would also give grieving families a breathing space to make funeral arrangements,the system is placed under great strain, delaying how many burials can take place. He said staff at the hospital - and where in the health service - are working incredibly hard and need the public to help by staying at home, cutting non-essential journeys and following self-isolation rules. Mr Ali added: The clapping yesterday was phenomenal - people are coming together and understanding how important the NHS is.

I just feel permanently sore, nauseous and knackered, a bit like the months after I became a dad again at , and thought I’d turned into an extra in a zombie film.My we’s in the same land of the living dead, so we’ve been taking it in turns at night to self-isolate on the couch in case the other person’s coughing, sweating or wheezing tempts us to self-smother. The best thing is you lose your sense of smell, so picking up dog mess is like gathering blossom petals, but the worst is you lose your taste, meaning opening a bottle of Rioja brings on the Jesus effect in reverse. It turns wine into water denying you the pleasure of drinking away the pain. Plenty of friends are going through the same ordeal making a mockery of the small number of cases alleged to be out there. Like us they can’t test, so don’t knowthey have Covid-, even though it’s odds-on they do. My we and I are lucky, as we’re both journalists who work from home, so we can still do our jobs and get paid. Some self-employed people with the symptoms are still turning up for contract work for fear of being sacked. Others, who live with vulnerable family members, have been toldthey want to self-isolate they won’t get paid.Which feeds into the narrative being set by some of those household name, self-made, business mavericks, whose initial response to the crisis showed they don’t give a toss about anything other than their place in the Sunday Times Rich List. You know these noble patriots: Sir Richard Branson, the tax exile worth around £billion, whose first reaction was to tell his Virgin Atlantic staff to take eight weeks’ unpaid leave, before demanding a £.bn government bailout. He has since put £million into his vast empire to keep it afloat. EasyJet owner Stelios Haji-Ioannou telling pilots and cabin crew to take two months’ unpaid leave while paying himself £m in idends. Tim Martin, who begged for his ­Wetherspoon pubs to stay open despite the threat of infection, then advised his , workers to get a job at Tesco. He’s since been embarrassed into a U-turn and is now taking advantage of the taxpayer-funded staff retention scheme. Mike Ashley trying to keep his Sport Direct stores open on the grounds that the nation would collapse without an endless supply of cheap, white socks. Then ramping up the cost of home exercise equipment. After the PR disaster he now says he’s sorry.

If you turn up to Tesco or whatever after a -hour sht and can’t get basic stuff... that’s something we have been hearing from our members right across London. “That’s having a genuine impact on their well-being.” Ms Bissessar added: “The public need to support us.” As well as having trouble buying food, NHS workers are at high risk of contracting the coronavirus because of their contact with infected patients. When asked whether front line staff were being tested, Ms Bissessar said there were inconsistencies across her area.  Ms Bissessar confirmed national reports that extra supplies of protective masks and equipment, brought in by the armed forces, are now filling the stores of London’s hospitals. “I’ve spoken to members today and yesterday and have been informed that supplies are back in place. Large amounts have been provided by the Army and they have been informed they have enough,” she said. Concerns remain around “critical-care capacity” – whether there will be enough space, enough beds and enough staff to treat the growing numbers of critically ill patients. Northwick Park Hospital, in Harrow, declared a “critical incident” after reaching full capacity on March .  On March , it was reported that  patients with coronavirus had died at either the hospital or sister hospital Ealing Hospital in just four days. Ms Bissesser said: “I’m aware that hospitals are finding that intensive care is an area where they don’t have extra capacity. They are already at capacity and are having to transfer critical-care patients to other hospitals because they are full.” Despite facing challenges with access to PPE equipment and testing, Ms Bissessar said her members are “focused on delivering the best care they can for their patients” despite challenging circumstances. “They are focusing on looking after the critically ill patients who have the virus,” she said.

Professor Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London, said: Whilst the PM was telling people to stay at home and keep at least two metres apart from each other, the House of Commons was open for business and face-to-face parliamentary activities were carrying on.  Given the transmission routes of touching contaminated surfaces and breathing in virus-laden droplets, it should not come as a surprise to hear that the PM and Health Secretary have tested positive for coronavirus.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThere are eight signs that you might have had coronavirus Covid- a month before it was previously thought to have arrived in the UK. Research carried out by Oxford Universityaposs Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group suggests that Covid- may have reached the UK by mid-January at the latest. The scenario is one of the several the researchers presented as possible, and goes against previously understood death rates. In the non-peer reviewed study they suggest that the coronavirus, like many emerging infections, may have spread invisibly for a month before its effects became clear at the end of February. If the Oxford researchers are right, then as much as half of the countryaposs population may already have been infected. Many people have contactedto claim that they experienced symptoms linked to Covid- in the weeks following the New Year. Below are the eight symptoms that may suggest you have already been infected by the coronavirus. Get all the latest coronavirus updates in our LIVE blog  Eye infections New research has indicated that eye infection such as conjunctivitis may be a symptom of Covid-. The College of Optometrists said: It is recognised that any upper respiratory tract infection may result in viral conjunctivitis as a secondary complication, and this is also the case with Covid-. However, it is unlikely that a person would present with viral conjunctivitis secondary to Covid- without other symptoms of fever or a continuous cough as conjunctivitis seems to be a late feature where is has occurred. A dry cough Perhaps the most recognisable of the Covid- symptoms, given how dferent it can sound compared to a typical cough. The cough is generally new for you - or dferentyou generally have a smokeraposs cough -and persistant. More often than not it will last for at least half a day. Mental fatigue    Although this has not been officially chalked up as a symptom, Covid- sufferers have reported experiencing mental fatigue. Thea Jourdan told The Daily Mail that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache. The mum-of-three then began to experience brain fog. Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever, the Hampshire woman told the publication. But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. A high temperature    Although numbers y for dferent people, a rise in body temperature generally counts as a fever once it reaches .C . You can tell you have a feveryou feel hot to the touch on yourchest or back. Itaposs dficult to catch your breath If your chest starts to feel tight or you cannot breath, you may have caught the coronavirus. Most young people or those without pre-existing health conditions are unlikely to experience this symptom. Dyspnea - the term for when someone has dficulty breathing - may be coupled with a tightness in the chest, rapid breathing and heart palpatations. Loss of sense of smell and taste    Over the weekend the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology warned that losing your sense of smell and taste may mean you have Covid-. The ear, nose and throat specialist recommended anyone with such symptoms self-isolate immediatley. It has been suggested that the phenomena may be caused by the coronavirus killing cells in the nose and throat. Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas, the Association said in a statement. We have also identied a new symptomthat may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate - again to reduce the spread of the virus. Tummy ache    As with a loss of appetite, enduring a tummy ache may easily be passed off as a sign of something more innocuous. However, a newly published study by the American Journal of Gastroenterology links tummy problems to Covid-. They found that .% of  people who have been infected by the coronavirus in Chinaaposs Hubei province had digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea. Physical fatigue    Another common symptom of Covid-, as well as cold, flu and many viruses in general, is feeling tired or fatigued. Being told to rest is common when you’re ill, but feeling tired and not being able to sleep due to coughs and dficulty breathing, can make things all the more dficult.

Thomas Davies, , started developing a cough, aches and cold sweats when he finished working last Friday. He passed away on Thursday, having spent the night sitting up with infant son Morgan, the Daily Post reports. His mother said she could not even hug family members in their grief because they were observing social distancing. Mandy Davies said: We can’t embrace each other and I can’t even comfort my family because I can’t see them. I can’t put my arms around any of them because we have to stay two metres apart. Get all the latest coronavirus updates in our LIVE blog I went to see my daughter and I had to stay at the bottom of the path. The -year-old mother said Thomas had appeared to be over the worst of the illness and was getting better on Wednesday, when she last spoke to him. He had been following government advice to self-isolate at home, but on Thursday he was found dead by his partner Rhiannon Elias, also , at their home in Penygroes, Wales.Paramedics dressed in protective clothing took his body away. Ms Davies said: When I arrived at the hospital, they were all in their suits. “I couldn’t even touch him, I wasn’t allowed. “I wasn’t even allowed to see him for long because they suspected the virus, and they needed to put him back into bags. “He had a plastic bag over his face.” Ms Davies, a health care worker, said tests were due to be carried out to establishThomas - who had no prior medical problems - had Covid-. His mother said: He was fit, he was healthy, he was energetic, he never smoked.  “He had nothing wrong with him. It’s a shock. “We’re just all in zombie mode at the moment. “I’ve been told to keep isolating. We’ve all got to self isolate. It’s all so cruel.” Rhiannon has now been told she must isolate with her children, Dylan Elias-Davies, four, and newborn Morgan, for the next fortnight. They had been unable to see Thomasapos body after he died. Ms Davies added: Rhiannon is absolutely devastated. She is in a million pieces. Her heart has come apart.” Paying tribute to her son, Ms Davies described him as having a “heart of gold”, and said he was a “devoted dad” to his boys. She added how her son would “do anything for anybody” and would always “go out of his way for anyone.” Ms Davies, who is no longer able to work, is now hoping to launch a fundraising campaign to help pay for her son’s funeral costs. She said people needed to understand the very real danger coronavirus posed, adding: This is no joke, take it seriously.

Deirdre Barr, , has been appointed director of operations at the newly established ExCel national emergency medical centre in East London. She called her sister Dolores to break the news, telling her: “Don’t worry about me, I’ll be grand. I want you to stay safe, stay home and keep washing your hands, love.” Deirdre, of Derry, Northern Ireland, is a former St John Ambulance cadet who went on to dedicate  years of her le to the NHS.Get all the latest coronavirus updates in our LIVE blogNow she is leaving her home in Kent to get back on the front line. Sister Dolores, , said: “This is a massive job, and we’re scared for Deirdre, but we are so very proud that she has taken it on. If anyone can do this, Deirdre can. She’s always been the one person her whole family turns to in times of trouble and sickness. “Now the whole of the UK will be turning to her. She’ll handle it well. She has broad ­shoulders and never shirks from ­responsibility. “This job is going to ask an awful lot of her but we know she’ll face it head on. The pictures we are seeing of the Nightingale Hospital are terrying but our Deirdre will take it all in her stride.  The staff who’ll be working under her will be relying on her and they’ll become devoted to her, and she won’t let them down. “The next time we see her in Derry, we’ll know her work is done and we pray we can allow Deirdre and heroes like her to retire and never have to do a job like this again.” The Government says it expects  beds to be ready for use at the ­Nightingale Hospital by next week.  In total , beds are due to be installed at the centre in London’s Docklands. The Army is helping to build and support the facility. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it will “comprise two wards, each of , people”. “We’ll make sure we have the capacity we need so everyone can get the support they need,” he said.  Other cities are preparing as the pandemic reaches its peak. It has been reported around  makesht ­hospitals may be needed. The National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham has been earmarked as a potential venue. In Manchester, the Central Convention Complex is thought to be under consideration.

Major General Timothy Cross, who ran NATO’s emergency relief in Kosovo and Macedonia in the s, said it was a “big process” to create a field hospital, but the military was used to it. He said: “What you’ve got in the ExCeL centre is a large, open space with power, lighting, water, sanitation, good accessibility but obviously the ability to isolate.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how meghan markle prince harry","story":"NewsHow Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are spending days in LA coronavirus isolationThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles with their son Archie and are now in isolation as the coronavirus pandemic continues across the globeShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsThe three royals have been hunkering down in LA \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Crammed together with a hundred others in the pitch-black lower deck of the schooner Clotilda, little Matilda – or Tildy – was too young to know what was happening or why men had raided her village, killed her father and ripped her away from her brothers. Herded into pens and thrown chained into the slave ship, the terried family clung together for  long days as it sailed the notorious Middle Passage – the Atlantic slave route on which more than two million Africans died en route to America. Matilda’s mum Grace did all she could to care for her daughters during the unimaginably tortuous journey. Midway across, she saw her nephew and a fellow villager’s young son die of illness – and their bodies thrown unceremoniously overboard. When the wooden ship finally docked in Alabama nearly two months later, her two eldest daughters were immediately sold at a slave market and young Matilda would never see her sisters ever again. It sounds like an appalling story from a shameful chapter of world history centuries past – but, incredibly, Matilda, one of the last slaves abducted from Africa, was alive within living memory. And she was even around to hold her grandson, who was three when she died – and is still alive today. One of the last transatlantic slave ships, the Clotilda was still making illegal trips to capture Africans a long time after the American Congress banned the slave trade – although not slavery – in . The vessel’s slavers are thought to have brought the last cargo of African slaves to the US, arriving in Mobile, Alabama, in July . Now believed to be the last survivor of the barbaric trade, the world would never have heard the story of Matilda McCrearit was not for a Newcastle University lecturer who has painstakingly unearthed the details of her le. Hannah Durkin, a literature and film professor, had previously identied Redoshi Smith, who died in , as the last surviving slave.  But, after finding an obituary for Redoshi in an Alabama newspaper, she came across a story about another slave – Matilda – who survived until . Hannah explains: “After I found Redoshi, I had an inkling there was an obituary in the local newspaper, but I had to wait for it to be digitised. “When this old edition was finally made available, I came across a story about another survivor of the Clotilda who had walked to the county courthouse to make a claim for compensation for her enslavement. “It was a big surprise. I didn’t expect to be the first person who had come across her. But I couldn’t find her story anywhere, it had never been told.” The article, in the Selma Times-Journal, revealed a strong, independent woman who, despite the traumatic start to her le, was an unknown trailblazer of the civil rights movement in America that would take off three decades later. Hannah says: “It was a very racist newspaper article from the s about a former slave having the audacity to ask for compensation. Yet it shows her as a very dignied and proud woman, whose independence and outrage comes through. Former slaves were seen as second-class citizens. But she marched for  miles, at the age of , to the Dallas county courthouse to demand her rights. “It was the same building which,  years later, would see the birth of the civil rights movements after African Americans were beaten back as they climbed the courthouse steps to demand the right to vote. “Matilda’s actions were lost in history, she received no recognition and she died in poverty. But now we have discovered the last surviving slave had been demanding equal rights a long time before the civil rights movement which changed America.”  The more Hannah managed to find about Matilda’s story, the more remarkable was the person she found. The day she was herded off the Clotilda and last saw her two older sisters, she was sold, together with her mum and -year-old sister Sallie, to a wealthy plantation owner called Memorable Creagh. Matilda, Grace and Sallie tried to escape the plantation soon after they arrived, but they were recaptured. And while the abolition of slavery in  brought emancipation to Matilda’s family, they continued to work Creagh’s land, trapped in poverty as share-croppers. While Grace was resigned to a le of servitude and apparently never learned English, what is known about Matilda shows she was a strong-willed woman, proud of her African heritage, who refused to be downtrodden or treated as a lesser human being. Instead of keeping her slave owner’s name, Creagh, she changed it to McCrear in order “to put her own spin on it and assert her independence,” Hannah says. Matilda also refused to get married. Instead, she had a decades-long relationship with a white, German-born Jewish man, a union that was virtually unheard of – and severely frowned upon – at the time. Hannah says: “It was presumably a very secretive and covert relationship, but she had  children with him over a -year period, and  of her children lived to adulthood.” The former slave also appears throughout her le to have worn her hair in a traditional Yoruba style and proudly carried facial markings from a traditional rite in Africa. “She was clearly very proud of her West African identity,” says Hannah. “Her mum must have helped her keep her traditions alive. “She had been robbed of most of her family and so much of her identity, but she was determined to hold on to her roots and ancestry.” The journey she set out on aged  was typical of her spirit and tenacity. Leaving her home in Mobile, she walked  miles along dirt roads to the Dallas county courthouse to make a claim for compensation for her enslavement.  For a former slave to be so bold in the Deep South in the s was an affront to many and laughable to others, and the judge quickly dismissed her claim. But the preposterous idea of claiming reparation for having been snatched from her country, sold and enslaved in the US caught the attention of the local media. The article Hannah uncovered, oozing racism, read: “An old African woman in the Court House corridor, patiently waiting her turn to see the Probate Judge. Her name was Tildy McCrear.” It went on: “She bore the mark of an African tribe on her left cheek. Tildy pointed to the symbol with pride. It was the crowning proof of her contention that she was a pure-blooded African who had come to America aboard the last slave ship to smuggle in a cargo of Negroes “Tildy believed that being snatched from her home in Africa, while yet an infant, called for a little reimbursement.” After the judge dismissed her claim and sent her away to live the rest of her le in poverty, she thanked him “with grand courtesy”, adding: “I don’t spec I needs anything more’n I got,” according to the article. When she died nine years later, aged , there was no obituary and no recognition that America’s last surviving slave had passed away. Moreover, her many children never mentioned to their own children and grandchildren the fact she had been a slave, nor that she had challenged the system a long time before the famous civil rights activists came along and changed history. It was down to Hannah to break the news to Matilda’s grandson Johnny Crear, , about his grandmother’s incredible and heartbreaking story.Talking about finding out how Matilda had been enslaved, he said: “I had a lot of mixedemotions. I thoughtshe hadn’t undergone what had happened, I wouldn’t be here. But that was followed by anger.”"},{"url":null,"title":"woman 21 who joked not","story":"NewsWoman, , who joked about not social distancing is diagnosed with coronavirusIreland Tate posted a video on social media saying she was aware of the self-quarantining and social distancing measures put in place to keep everyone safe - but said she was not worriedShareCommentsByChiara Fiorillo:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsIreland Tate tested positive for Covid- \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening.

Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

Do you keep the players ticking over on their own or rest “The most important thing, though, is the health of everybody – as a club we are doing everything to look after our players and our staff, that’s paramount.“There’s not many times when I’ll say football isn’t important but it isn’t right now.”The Dundee players have been given inidual training programmes to work on at home but, with government advice to stay indoors as much as possible, it’s not easy for some.“As a club we have set up inidual programmes for the players but the trouble with that is a lot of the work is on treadmills or exercise bikes and not everyone has access to them,” added the Dens boss.“Otherwise you’re asking them to go out and do bits in the park and the advice is now not really to do that.

Bottom of the second tier got £,.Could they not pay out the minimum to everybody right now and decide the rest later Welcome to lockdown everybody! I’ve now been working from home for over a week and getting used to it.

Veronica said: “After coming up with the idea, I created the page and I contacted a friend of mine as I know her sister is a local singer, so she agreed to come on board with this.“She’ll be presenting and singing herself and naturally we’ve enlisted a few other people too.“I don’t sing so will not be making any live appearances as I’m not one for public speaking.“Marie Western will be presenting and is really what you could refer to as the face of Lockdown Live Aberdeenshire.“She’s got a list of artists so far and we’re just awaiting some more.“Our aim is to do it like a gig, with time slots for each artist, not going on too late in the evening as we understand people are doing it in their own homes so have to take noise levels into consideration as we head into the evening for performers’ neighbours.”Lockdown Live Aberdeenshire begins at pm on Saturday and the same time again on Sunday.It runs until .pm on both nights.For more information and the online event’s full line-up

where to be tested # but it can now be done by NHS Grampian, so results come back quicker.NHS Grampian has become one of the first health board’s in Scotland to be able to do the test using special machines.Up to  samples can now be tested in the city each day # though it is understood that many tests are not currently required.There are plans to increase testing capability in the coming weeks.NHS Grampian’s consultant and service clinical director for medical microbiology and virology, Noha EL Sakka said: “There is an essential need, in order to manage this outbreak, for having prompt diagnostic technology.“Prior to Monday we were sending samples to the reference lab and there is a high turnaround time and time is wasted on transportation.#That has all been cut-off.#It cuts down on work for the lab with packaging and also in terms of reporting results too.“That is why we tried to streamline things and make the test available as quickly as possible and the process as simple as possible.#It ensures we have a prompt and robust system for our patients in NHS Grampian.”Fiona MacKenzie, Scottish microbiology and virology network manager, added: “When the covid- outbreak first emerged in Scotland and the UK, Glasgow and Edinburgh started testing for the whole of Scotland.“NHS Grampian is one of the first health boards to go live with its own testing.“It’s great news we’re able to do this but there has been a lot of work.”Dr El Sakka added: “The massive benefit of this is it cuts out a huge time lag and is easing pressure on our colleagues at the reference lab.#We get results locally and faster and this is even more important with patients who require critical care.“We have changed sht patterns to extend the coverage so we can report results late into the evening and that helps with patient flow and that helps move pressure away from our frontline care teams.”Dr El Sakka said scientists from the north-east had travelled to the reference lab to witness the process that was being undertaken before beginning work to launch a service in the north-east.She added: “In order for the lab to introduce the test we had to show that our lab, our staff and the skills we have were capable of producing an accurate result.“We demonstrated that our samples were accurate.#Then Health Protection Scotland was happy for us to start testing on our own form that point onwards.”Dr El Sakka praised the ability and dedication of her colleagues to get the testing up and running swtly in the north-east.She said: “It’s a huge tribute to the dedication and skill of the team we have here in Grampian that we have got to this place so quickly.#I’m so proud of the staff and the dedication they have and their commitment.”Dr MacKenzie, who is a clinical scientist at ARI, added: “In Aberdeen, at NHS Grampian, we have a particularly good skill mix, we have very highly specialised biomedical scientists and medics and we’ve implemented a test here that reflects that skill set.#It really is testament to the high level of skill and knowledge our staff here have.”lthgtWe#ll bring you all of the news as it happens throughout the day:lt

Advertiser ran a story entitled #Skate park pipe dream a reality for Lochgilphead#. Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility.

The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

The Nest is set in Monersquos hometown of Glasgow. While ostensibly a drama about surrogacy, it is really a tale of two cities, two Scotlands, the haves and the have nots.Property developer Dan and his musician we Emily , have everything, including a stunning lochside home, but not the child they long for.Kayahas a flat in Possil with barely a stick of furniture in it, and the kind of temper that sees her threaten to stab her case worker with a bottle.The opposites collide when Emily gets lost one night and hits -year-old Kaya with her car. So far, so Bonfire of the Vanities. The teen starts to work her way into the older womanrsquos le and, long story short, offers to be a surrogate infor pound,.Dan thinks this is a crazy idea, not to mention illegal. As does his sister, his lawyer, Emilyrsquos colleague, and probably every viewer watching. Many a drama would struggle to get beyond such a point, but the writer here is Nicole Taylor , who carefully takes each objection and picks away at it.: Susan Swarbrick meets Martin CompstonUltimately, the viewer has to believe that Emily is unhinged by grief, and that Dan would give in because he is desperate to keep her. Madness happens when people convince themselves a situation is all or nothing, black or white. That is how noir works.Even so, Taylorrsquos story is such a high-wire act that it needs to keep propelling itself onwards at speed or it will crash to the ground in a heap of improbabilities.Helping immensely with the task of keeping the viewer on side is a terric cast. Rundle is a convincing mix of fierce determination and eggshell fragility. Mack, a real find, does that bravest of things as an actor and makes herself an unlikeable pain in the neck.Then there is Compston. Once the prince of Sunday nights as Essex wide boy DS Arnott in Line of Duty, he is even better back on his home turf and in his own accent.It was a nice touch by Taylor to make Dan a bad boy made good, eventhe working class middle class contrast was laid on a a bit thick. Every time Kaya appeared the score would slip into menacing music mode, as though people who do not live in beautul lochside homes were naturally best avoided.What a house, mind. As in Guilt, Glasgow scrubbed up well. While The Nestrsquos location choices were more obvious ndash the Botanic Gardens, City Chambers, Kelvingrove Park ndash so far there is not a red sandstone tenement in sight.With four episodes to go, Taylorrsquos cleverly sleekit drama is shaping up nicely, playing on viewersrsquo assumptions.

Reluctantly she promised strictly to self-isolate, hence the call to cancel. In some ways I was relieved, because the responsibility had been gnawing at me. Bad enough to fall ill yourself, but a hundred times worseyou pass it on.As last week unfolded, with more stringent government warnings and edicts issued every day ndash sometimes every few hours ndash I heard of more and more instances like this. Children of elderly parents, and some who havenrsquot yet reached retirement age, were imploring, begging, and in some cases emotionally blackmailing them to heed medical advice and stay behind doors.My husband, who is -plus on the outside but at heart still at Newport when Dylan went electric, also came under fire. Hersquod made the mistake of mentioning to his daughter that he had taken a minibus to get groceries. Compared to the -year-old who leapt on a bus to the Buchanan Galleries and bought a piano ahead of the lockdown, hersquod been ultra-cautious. Instead of catching the bus home, he had ed on foot over the hills, his backpack stuffed with goodies.His daughter knew better than to tackle him directly, so texted me instead. ldquoTell her not to worry, he replied. As reassurance goes, it lacked a certain rigour. How often have teenagers told their mum or dad ldquonot to worry when they were neglecting their homework, or spending the small hours who knows where, doing who knows what  Did that lower their blood pressure one iota Up and down the country, the tables have been turned. If this were the era of switchboards, operators could tap into millions of lines and hear the increasingly anxious voices of the middle-aged trying to get their stubborn and defensive old ones to see sense.The problem is, the over-seventies are exceptionally proud of retaining their independence. They bridle at any hint of being past it or not capable of looking after themselves. In normal circumstances this is a healthy mindset, fending off the reality of advancing years and the worry of one day becoming a burden. How many magazine features have you read reporting that  is the new , and weightlting and running are essential to stave off premature rigor mortis  Until the past fortnight, all those who remember rationingand were carrying on asthey were mere striplings were viewed as marvels and inspirations. Now, their gung-ho, can-do spirit has to be put on hold, forced into hibernation for however long this blight lasts. I donrsquot envy any son or daughter reminding their mother or father of their vulnerability, and urging them to take seriously the mortal threat that lies beyond the gate.To see children laying down the law is yet another example of a world gone bananas. You could call it pay-back. Did any of us manage to get through adolescence without coming under constant sniper attack  Most parents griped and girned until their hair turned grey. In our household you could set the clock by the raised voices chivvying us to get out to school, or turn down the radio, or help with the washing up. The small print of parent-child contracts includes the adultrsquos right to scold, ponticate and nag as often as required. Juniorrsquos side of the bargain makes no provision for reasoned argument, protest or rebellion. It states simply that they must unquestioningly obey, preferably for all time.The irony of policing onersquos parents behaviour doesnrsquot make this any easier. But perhaps therersquos a frisson of satisfaction in being able to exact revenge on those who spent the best years of their lives hectoring and carping. Could it feel like a righting of old wrongs to chastise dad for his recklessness, or ask a -year-old to grow up when she suggests an SAS-style dawn-raid on the supermarket It is especially satisfying, surely, that the role reversal necessary to reinforce these new rules is done in the name of commonsense and caring. When the point of the exercise is to protect the lives of those you love, in terms of moral high ground itrsquos up there with Macchu Pichu. What possible riposte can anyone give when urged to take precautions not just to safeguard yourself, but those closest to you Yet as most handbooks to raising a family suggest, nagging is futile. It sets up a vicious circle of resentment and rebellion, and makes the one being chastised feel sore. When people are lectured, they switch off, mentally reaching for the headphones until the tone of voice improves. Whether yoursquore  or , that never changes. So, as a mass technological revolution is rolled-out, with elderly luddites being all but forcibly initiated into the art of video calling, more trouble lies ahead.In an old-fashioned phone conversation, finger-wagging offspring canrsquot see their loved ones rolling their eyes, putting an invisible gun to their temples, or mouthing ldquoGive me a break!. But as soon as they can observe the impact their words are having itrsquoll be like travelling back in time. Theyrsquoll see these beloved faces taking on an unfamiliar juvenile expression: sullen irritation, avoidance of eye contact, nail-biting, fidgeting, a huffily shrugged shoulder.The longer these virus vigilantes bang on, the less response theyrsquoll get. The age-old aria between adult and adolescent is an unequal contest: a torrent of words in one corner, mutinous monosyllables in the other. I donrsquot doubt for a moment that most older folk will pay heed to their familyrsquos concerns.

And it came in a seemingly unimportant way. The experience was like hearing a distant rumble of thunder and realising a raging storm was approaching.On Monday nights, I get my weekly fix of American political satire when I tune into Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, and then Bill Maherrsquos Real Time show. These programmes are the beating heart of liberal America. Both play before live audiences ndash but not last week. The hosts told their jokes to empty, silent studios. Vibrant, energy-packed stand-up felt hollow, deadened, humourless. And then both shows announced they were going off air.Little spots of light in our culture keep going dark. British TV dramas stopped filming. Release dates for movies were delayed, even the latest James Bond, titled ndash with awful serendipity ndash No Time To Die. Bond may seem inconsequential ndash and, indeed, in the great scheme of things a spy film is utterly meaningless ndash but the mothballing of one of the biggest global entertainment franchises shows just how much Coronavirus has silenced culture.Some will rightly say: therersquos plenty of existing culture to keep us occupied ndash lots of books and films and music. Thatrsquos true, but itrsquos not the point. Thatrsquos not what culture is for. Culture isnrsquot there just to keep you distracted. Culture is also meant to reflect the world wersquore living in, to express the human spirit right here and right now. When culture stops, that canrsquot happen. And eventually, even Netflix will run out of stockpiled programmes. Culture ndash in the shape of books, films and songs ndash is finite. It needs replenished.Writers, musicians and film-makers speak more sincerely to me about the world than any politician. Now those artists are silent, or at least, their latest work is, for the time being, unavailable to help me, and you, navigate our lives.So we arenrsquot just living at a time when culturally our pleasures, our distractions, have been put on hold, wersquore living at a time when culture is most needed yet most absent.

This cultural silence is new to planet Earth. Itrsquos coronavirusrsquo hateful gt.Of course, wersquoll spring back. Therersquos one facet of human le that hasnrsquot come to a standstill: science, and itrsquos racing forward to save us all.Nor should we forget, that while catastrophes may chloroform culture for a while, culture can never be entirely smothered. And once catastrophes end, culture blooms like a parched garden after rain. The aftermath of the First World War and the Spanish Flu saw modernism flourish, jazz take over the world, the triumph of cinema. After , there was Rock and Roll, and Angry Young Men. The Renaissance was born from the Black Death.In this time of cultural silence, we need to remember the one thing culture has always said loudly: the human spirit is indomitable.

But yesterday standing in line at the pharmacy ndash outside in the rain for an hour ndash to get a refill on my prescription I felt a little contraction.It got a bit tighter when they told me they could only fill half my order until they received more stock.And then another little squeeze when I opened the box and the order was made up of pills from two dferent manufacturers, rapidly shoved together into a box to get me on my way. I could see the scissor marks on the packaging.Irsquod never seen that before. Or empty shelves in grocery stores, for that matter.The next -hours werenrsquot great. I started refreshing browser tabs too often and paying attention to accounts that were pushing Mad Maxnarratives.I was googling home Covid- tests, reading through migration laws to find outI could be sent homeI became seriously sick and what would happenI died hooked up to a ventilator thousands of miles from Canada with my immigrant family stranded in Glasgow.Thatrsquos called catastrophizing ndash letting your brain trick you into thinking the worst outcome is the most logical. Itrsquos awful. And itrsquos common. I kept it up most of the day, pretending it wasnrsquot stress and I was doing great.When I visited Asda and wanted to cry because there werenrsquot any chicken fajita kits in the meat aisle, I finally took a breath and reminded myself that I knew better. Irsquod been here before. We all have.This is a mess. The economy is a mess. Government bailout programs arenrsquot a mess yet, but they probably will be when itrsquos time to start unwinding all the stimulus and rev up all of the businesses we throttled to stop the spread of the disease. Wersquoll all feel the echoes of this crisis for decades to come.But I canrsquot control any of those things. I can take care of my family. I can check in on my friends. I can do my job well and try to help everyone I work with do theirs well. I can remind people that things always get better.:Book sales up as people self-isolate with a good readAlways. Prove me wrong.I didnrsquot get all the way to a panic attack yesterday ndash I made it home and the dog sat on my lap. I jumped onto a video call with some colleagues and within minutes the tightness was easing. Irsquom lucky to have such great colleagues.I had almost forgotten the lessons I learned through the  recession: the worst-case scenario isnrsquot the most-likely scenario, everyone pulls together in the end, things get better, help is thereyou ask. .I donrsquot know how this all ends. Nobody does. But Irsquom comforted by the lessons of the past. Bad times pass, but the good discovered through crises lingers.

But now, every day is a school day: as the founder and managing director of the teenage incubator programme, Orbit Enterprise Education, ramps up the  to help young people launch their own business.At , his young shoulders carry far more experience that someone of his age would usually have and he tracks his own illustrious career to date like a seasoned entrepreneur on stage at a motivational business conference.Indeed, Aitken credits businessman Sir Tom Hunter, chief executive of The Hunter Foundation and one of Scotlandrsquos most highly regarded philanthropists and entrepreneurs, as a role model and mentor. Recalling their first meeting, he says: ldquoI had the idea for Orbit and heard that Sir Tom was going to be visiting Boyd Tunnockrsquos factory in Uddingston, he says.ldquoIrsquod taken the day off school and waited in the car park, then caught him as he came out ndash it was May , , a date that will forever stick in my mind.Fortunately, Sir Tom took the time to chat to the ambitious young schoolboy.ldquoHe was surprised but receptive, and I think he liked my spark and the fact Irsquod gone out to make something happen, suggests Aitken.Since launching Orbit Enterprise Education five years ago, the business has supported over  students aged between  and  to launch their own businesses- through what Aitken claims is one of the worldrsquos first business incubator programmes for students.Support has come from RBS and Entrepreneurial Spark among others. In , he won pound, in the final of Scottish EDGE ndash the competition aimed at identying and supporting Scotlandrsquos up-and-coming, high-growth potential entrepreneurial talent.From its early roots in Glasgow -with the first two intakes creating  new businesses with an annualised combined turnover of over pound, just four months after the programmersquos launch- Orbit has established ldquochapters in major cities across the UK, including Edinburgh, Birmingham, London and Manchester.Kieran Aitken dropped out of university to focus on building his own business empireOrbit has decentralised its structure and now entrepreneurs based overseas can apply for a licence to run the programme. The organisation, meanwhile, has plans to open chapters in Australia, Canada and the USA by .The incubator programme is a powerful one, suggests Aitken. ldquoWe cover everything that you need to help you be successful in business, he explains.ldquoFrom generating ideas, all the financial and legal stuff like tax and accounts to raising finance and sales and marketing ndash itrsquos very, very comprehensive.ldquoWe provide mentoring and access to leading business figures, advice on how to scale up and grow a business, how to build and lead your team ndash everything that will help create the winning mindset and knowledge required to run a successful business.That said, no amount of teaching, coaching and mentoring can prepare a young person for the hard work and determination required in setting up and running a business. ldquoI think some people have that entrepreneurial gene, says Aitken, who launched his first business at the age of .ldquoFrom quite a young age I wanted to make money and at school I was selling lsquoanything legalrsquo in the playground, he continues. ldquoI was never very academic at school but was an avid reader of business books and started a car and van detailing company with just pound. By the time I was  it was generating a healthy five-figure net profit annually.All the same, the Renfrewshire schoolboy went on to study business at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoIt wasnrsquot a case of not enjoying university, but I was still running my business and not devoting enough time to study so I dropped out in third year, he says. ldquoContinuing wouldnrsquot have been fair on my tutors or myself.Today, he explains, many of his ldquoOrbiteers have the same outlook in that they donrsquot necessarily feel that further education is the best career option for them.ldquoA lot of young people donrsquot know what they want to do, but go to university without any clear goals, says Aitken.ldquoSchool just doesnrsquot work for everyone andthere are problems at home or other issues then that can impact on their studies ndash and for others, the prospect of another three or four years of studying after leaving school isnrsquot attractive.ldquoA good brain and personal drive ndash and the determination to make your own path in le ndash can be worth much more than a degree, he says.ldquoFrom coffee shops to online magazines, wersquove helped young people with bright ideas in many dferent business sectors launch their own companies with some achieving a five-figure income before their th birthday.But Aitkenrsquos message to all young people starting out in business is to ldquonot get carried away too soon.ldquoI moved too quickly on a flawed revenue model and didnrsquot plan very well, he admits. ldquoWe bounced back and are much more careful now and take advice, but it taught me that you canrsquot run a business without making mistakes.ldquoWhen you do make a mistake, donrsquot give up ndash pick yourself back up, get on with it and yoursquoll come back stronger.Orbitrsquos three-month incubator programme, believes Aitken, is the ldquoultimate training experience for the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.To date,  new businesses have been created with Orbitrsquos support and on average there are  applications for every space available on the programme.In addition to running Orbit Enterprise Education as a social enterprise, Kieran Aitken operates DripDrab, a tech business he launched last year that provides card payment processing to tradespeople and allows households across the UK to book a window cleaner at the click of a button.The business is growing at pace and there are plans to expand the  to incorporate additional services such as plumbing and dog walking.Find out more at www.orbit-incubator and www.dripdrab"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11201286.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-artist-colours-blues-away-social-isolation","story":"OVER the coming weeks, we are all likely to struggle with the boredom of being stuck at home.Butyou find yourself twiddling your thumbs ndash or climbing the walls - then adult colouring could be the answer.No longer just a pastime of kids trying to stay between the lines, intricate grown-up colouring books have been proven to reduce stress and anxiety, improve motor skills and even aid sleep.In our current hyper-anxious world, adult colouring appears like the perfect solution.

What is alarming is how little challenge there has been to our government#s decision to take a dferent path from that recommended by the World Health Organisation . Shetland, Scotland and the UK is out of synch with almost everywhere  in how we are trying to tackle this coronavirus. We are not #following the science#, as ‘experts’ and politicians of ious colours frequently suggest. The scientic community is itself ided over this issue and we are following a particular reading of the science.WHO’s consistent advice has been to test, track and trace every suspected case of coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of countries are taking this approach. The UK Scientic Advisory Group For Emergencies , the body advising our politicians, do not believe we can contain the virus using the WHO#s methodology, so our government has allowed the virus to spread, while attempting to control itin a manner that doesn#t put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak.My opinion is worth little on this matter # but the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach concerns me, given the WHO#s history in dealing with virus outbreaks such as this. What disturbs me is the apparent lack of awareness about UK exceptionalism on this issue. We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. #We know best # trust us# will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn and so much is at stake. You are not an idiot. Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom. Only yesterday a self-ordained fitness person Facebooked about a boy trapped with the corpse of his sister for three days. The actual truth no otherwise healthy child has died worldwide of Covid, not one ever. The boy was a man, the sister was  and died of status epilepticus! Just what possesses people to peddle such tripe is beyond comprehension, but the online media is awash with it.I don#t think anybody knows which governments are taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done by every one of them or how their rhetoric dfers from the actual reality. I certainly don#t know and never claimed I did. I said the majority of countries are adopting the WHO approach, successfully or otherwise.I appreciateisn#t gospel and apologiseyou, or anybody , has evidence contrary to what they have stated.Time will tell whether this alternative approach has been for better or worse.Ian T # South Korea has followed WHO guidelines, testing more people per capita than anywhere , and the number of new cases there has dropped drastically.The country recorded  new cases of Covid- yesterday, compared with a peak of  cases on February th.I understand there is every chance the virus will spread again in South Koreaonce social contact restrictions are lted, but at the very least their efforts to contain the spread has bought them more time.More time to make sure their NHS and other essential services are prepared as well as possible. More time to acquire testing capability. More time to shield those most at risk from the virus as best as possible.You claim the WHO approach has been unsuccessful. South Korea adopted it and has had more success fighting this virus than anywhere .I appreciate what works in one country may not work where. What concerns me is our governmentshave paid little heed to the likes of South Korea and taken a path at odds with almost everywhere .A failure to adequately explain why has induced panic as much as anything . Now the UK resources are going into the new antibody test. That tells us who is immune, a far far more useful thing to know.You said earlier in this thread: #We have much ignorance and  information in the media.# I suggest you focus on getting your facts right before you start bashingor the press at large. Unless of course you have abandoned the truth and decided to take the path of the most habitual of liars Donald Trump  In which case I#d have more success debating this issuewith a brick!Now stop panicking and do like me. I have volunteered to come out of retirement and rejoin the NHS. I am qualied to help and will do so without questionI can. Now just stop your moaning, spreading of alarmist criticism and postulating about something you know little. Nothing is much worse than raising fear and alarm when one is not remotely qualied so to do.Ian T # I#d advise you to crawl out of your own behind, but you appear so far up it any effort to to do so would likely be futile. I#ll leave it for others to read this discussion and decide who knows what between us.With the government shutting down Parliament, and effective scrutiny of its actions, yesterdaythere is no prospect of outside pressure changing their course at the moment. Everybody#s time, is therefore, best spent dealing with the practicalities of the situation we face for now.Your offer to come out of retirement to help the health service is commendable and I wish you all the best with that. It was inspirational to see over half a million people sign up yesterday to volunteer with the NHS.I remain sceptical about the path our government is on with this coronavirus but the likes of these NHS volunteers give me hope. I urge everybody to follow their lead and do whatever they can to look after themselves, those around them and other people in general during these challenging times.Good to see your motivations are political rather like the newspaper you keep quoting from. If you believe what you babble on about Parliament Shutting down rational argument is pointless. Try not to be too frightened and really understand a little science and use some common sense.For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test. Whatever did you write your PhD thesis in, headlesschikenology or alarmistscarmongology !Faroes which have fixed links between the islands have  times as many cases as Shetland. May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry. So the spread by fixed link will perhaps be accelerated by a few minutes. Now, what probably makes more sense is that Faroe has a population of , rather more than  times that of Shetland., proportionally per head of population,Faroe, fixed links and all is doing rather better than us!!!Ian T.I think you may have accidently hit an extra  there # The current population of the Faroe Islands is c. , Ian, Faroe had a population of , as of June  . Unlike Shetland they are almost certainly testing for Covid- more widely in the community, so it is not possible to directly compare our current figure of  hospital tested cases to their .Whoops, no. I gave the population of Faro!! Portugal!!! Dyslexia rules OK!!!!Just to state the obvious. If you are afraid for yourself,relatives and loved ones. All you have to do is stay inside your house. It is as simple as that.This Virus can not get to youyou do that simple thing. It is not rocket science!!!Yes it can, via an envelope retrieved from a mailbox, groceries and any other items brought into your home that have been handled by other people.There are some strategies you may employ to minimize risk of contamination.Wear disposable gloves when retrieving mail, disinfect the mail before bringing it into your house.Junk mail should go directly from the mailbox to the bin. Retrieve mail only every two to three days to minimize exposure.As to groceries, avoid fresh produce.Wear disposable gloves when shopping.Only buy canned or frozen items and sanitize them before putting into storage.Ideally, buy enough that you can rotate the stock.Use only grocery items, canned or frozen that have been in your possession for  days or more.On the other handyou literally stay in your house and not opened the door to anyone or thing, for the next month or two, or three, or four# the virus probably will not be able to get to you.

And some concern has been voiced that the payments are not due to begin until June.One person worried about the future is Julie Leith, who started a cleaning business Shetland Cleaning Crew four years ago. Her sister Tracey joined the enterprise last year. Four people work for the business altogether.Despite the uncertainty, she is determined to hang on, despite having had to suspend work because of the lockdown. She is also anxious to protect her clients and her two young daughters.“Things are kind of tricky at the moment. They’ve come out with a package saying they will help, but as far as I’m aware it’ll not be available until June,# she said.“I was relieved there was going to be something in place, but by June I don’t kenI’ll still be able to trade. It’s very up in the air at the moment.”Coronavirus Disease  Graphic. Ms Leith said she was unable to work because most of her clients were senior citizens, “and I’m not classed as an essential worker”.“I’ve had to down tools to protect all of my elderly clients, and the lasses.”She has noticed a certain irony in having to cancel cleaning jobs at a time when cleaning is considered to be important in order to hold the virus off.“Once the lockdown had come everybody said ‘wait until the lockdown is over’ and we’ll reschedule the clean. Weirdly, the cleaning has dried up and that’s most important.”Ms Leith said she was avoiding news bulletins after becoming so concerned about the pandemic. But she said she was determined to hold on until June when her business may get the support it needs from the government.“I’m positive we will,” she said. “There are some days where I think we won’t, but I’m trying to stay positive.”Meanwhile a taxi driver, who did not wish to be named, said he had been able to secure Universal Credit, which he believed that would cover rent and council tax, but very little . His business, he said, had been able to stay open “but it is really what you might call bread and milk money”.The driver added he was not hopeful about the new support being offered, and added he had taken out a finance package on a new car in January, before adding the economic downfall could not have happened at a worse time.Painter and decorator Fearghas Noblett was dwelling on the positives. His work has disappeared but he said he believed he and his we Myra could could survive until June when he will hopefully qualy for a share of the government support.“It’s a relief that something is in place and compared to a lot of countries we are very, very fortunate to be living in such a democratic time that the government will think of doing that,” he said.He added he had stopped working despite being initially tempted to carry on.“I was told that the police have details of everybody’s vehicles and are monitoring those people who would be tempted to go out and work.“Initially I was. It’s like you feel part of the French Resistance # you’ve got to keep on doing what you do.“It was ambiguous, where they were saying ‘ you can’t work from home you need to go to work,’ but the goalposts changed quite rapidly.“We can’t be seen to just be carrying on because that’s quite a selfish thing to do.“From my point of view it would definitely be wrong for me to sneak around and think I could work..”He said he believed he could get by until June.“We have other income, Myra’s working. It’s not disastrous for us. When this is all blown over I’ve still got a job to go to.”Mr Carmichael welcomed the announcement, but indicated they could have gone further.“MPs of all parties have been highlighting the lack of support for self-employed people for some days and I am glad that the government is starting to catch up,” he said.“As I put it to the Prime Minister on Wednesday, self-employed people are not looking for special treatment but for equal treatment with employed people. The measures today seem to go some way towards that.“There are, however, still large gaps in the support for self-employed people. The wait until June will be extremely challenging for many, especially with the reluctance of many banks to offer bridging loans currently.“Tourism, which makes up such a vital part of the local economy in the isles, is obviously highly seasonal and yet this is not recognised in the Chancellor’s plan.“Three months of government support based on an ‘annual average’ will not paper over the financial hole faced by those who rely on the usual summer trade to cover them through the rest of the year.” raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"wilma named as shetland wool week patron ","story":"This years Shetland Wool Week patron Wilma Malcolmson.The Shetland Wool Week patron for this year was named today as knitwear designer Wilma Malcolmson, who is internationally renowned for her skilfully blended Fair Isle knitwear.The much-anticipated annual hat pattern, which is now synonymous with the launch of the patron, has also been released. This year’s official hat, designed by her, is called #Katie’s Kep#.The wool week organisers said they were delighted to have Mrs Malcolmson as this year’s patron. She was a key player in the local knitting community, a wool week and Shetland Peerie Makker tutor, and also one of Shetland’s most influential and innovative designers.She has lived in Shetland all her le and, like many others who grew up in the isles, has knitted from childhood. Originally from Garderhouse on the West Side, she later moved to Cunningsburgh where she lived with her late husband Leonard.She established her business, Shetland Designer, in  and during that time she has seen her creations reach all four corners of the world.Mrs Malcolmson said: “I am touched and honoured to be this year’s patron. Wool week is a wonderful event that helps to bring people, not just knitters, from all around the world together.#To me, the festival represents a time of friendship, of learning from each other and an appreciation of our islands and way of le as it celebrates old and new by putting traditional patterns and techniques on equal terms with new, innovative ones.#The hat is the common bond for us all and I am delighted to have been asked to design it and become part of the wool week story.“My hat ‘Katie’s Kep’ is named after my mother Katie. It includes the patterns that she taught me when I was a peerie lass because they were her favourites. She belonged to that large group of professional knitters, without whom our Shetland colour work and lace heritage might not have been as alive and vibrant as it is today. This is my tribute to all the known and unknown designer artists of Shetland throughout the centuries.”On her love of knitting, Mrs Malcolmson said: “My mother instilled in me an interest in patterns and colours, from her I learned the importance of contrast and ‘blending’. Colour inspiration is all around us in Shetland – you only need to look at the rugged landscape, seashores the ever-changing skies to find shades that work together.”She has created four very dferent colourways for the hat using yarn from Jamieson’s of Shetland, Jamieson and Smith, Uradale Yarns and Shetland Handspun.Each company has prepared yarn kits and are available to take back orders online, but are currently unable to guarantee specic delivery dates. Customers are urged to keep an eye on the respective websites for updates.The organisers said: “We are always thrilled to announce the new patron and hat, and perhaps even more so this year. Throughout this ongoing global crisis we have received many requests urging us to release the hat pattern and we are pleased to be able to make it available, as always, as a free download from our Shetland Wool Week website.#We hope it will bring some welcome light relief and focus as well as a sense of connection for all our supporters.”#Katie#s Kep# – this year#s official wool week hat.Mrs Malcolmson added: #I really do feel that this is in the interest of knitters. Under these strange times we are living in there are so many knitters around the world taking comfort from their work and enjoying their knitting when they are self-isolating.#Knitting has been so important to Shetland all through the years. When I grew up the knitters around me were knitting to help the economy, to put food on the table. It wasn#t a hobby at that time.#The th Shetland Wool Week is due to run from th September and already a huge amount of effort has gone into preparing for the event. However, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the event remains under review.• An extensive question and answer interview with Mrs Malcolmson is available to read via the Shetland Wool Week newsletter and website.

To ensure vital GP services can be maintained throughout the coming weeks and months, it is absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with non Covid- related conditions. “Covid- centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of having Covid- and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider.“Whilst the centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the Covid- pandemic, it is vital we balance this with the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.”Patients attending these centres will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.Dr Tom Black, Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, is among the GPs working at the new Primary Care Covid- Centre at Altnagelvin. He said: “GPs have organised themselves very quickly and there has been a huge amount of work done between the Department of Health, the Health and Social Care Board, Trusts and GP Federations to provide the community with these Covid- centres.“This method of GPs working in the middle ground is vital to protect hospital services for patients with the greatest need.

Ba amhlaidh an scéal i gclubanna eile.Ach fiú sular tháinig an fógra oigiúil ó Chumann Lúthchleas Gael, i gcomhar le Cumann Peile na mBan agus leis an Chumann Camógaíochta, bhí boird chontae agus cumainn aonair ag cur cluichí agus seisiúin traenála ar ceal.Sular ghníomhaigh rialtas na sé chontae fichead ar an ábhar, nuair a bhí rialtas na Breataine ag beartú ligean do phinsinéirí bás a fháil d’fhonn imdhíonacht sa mhórphobal a bhunú, mar dhea, thuig Cumann Lúthchleas Gael agus na clubanna an géarghá a bhí le scaradh sóisialta agus le hullmhú chun ‘an cuar a leacú’. Bhí a fhios acu go dtiocfadh an t-am go mbeadh an tír buailte go dona ag Covid-, ach go bhféadfaimis an donas a mhaolú.Chuir siad gach cluiche agus gach seisiún traenála ar ceal ag gach aoisghrúpa. Dhruid siad áiseanna éagsúla, ionaid aclaíochta agus clubanna sóisialta ina measc. Agus ansin thosaigh na clubanna ag cur teachtaireachtaí amach go raibh siad réidh le cuidiú le duine ar bith ina gceantar a mbeadh cúnamh de dhíth orthu.Tá neart grúpaí agus daoine aonair ag coinneáil súil ar a gcomharsana ag an am deacair seo. Tá siad ag déanamh siopadóireachta dóibh, ag ullmhú béilí, ag bailiú piollairí ón chógaslann, ag glacadh madaí amach ag siúl agus fiche rud eile.Tá eagrais eile seachas Cumann Lúthchleas Gael ag dul don obair thábhachtach seo fosta, ach bhí CLG ar thús cadhnaíochta agus tá siad le moladh go mór as sin.Tá CLG ar na heagrais shibhialta is mó agus is tábhachtaí i sochaí na tíre seo. Eagras é atá lán le saoránaigh – gnáthdhaoine a thuigeann a ndualgas i leith a gcomharsana.Mar a dúirt Ciarán Ó Brolcháin, seo an meon atá ag teastáil má tá muid chun poblacht na suáilce a thógáil i ndáiríre, ní hamháin i gcásanna éigeandála ach sa ghnáthshaol freisin."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"you think coronavirus is terrible but my generation has seen it all before","story":" vw, px\"   vw, px\"  Bridie Millar as a child with her mother, who died of TB, andtoday.While fears sweep Belfast about the spread of the Coronavirus, one pensioner told the Andersonstown News how living with deadly disease used to part of daily le for residents of the city.Bridie Millartold how #the White Scourge# # tuberculosis # swept through whole streets, wiping out families. It took her mother Annie Mary, and schoolgirl Bridie spent two years in a fever hospital along with her three younger siblings.#The coronavirus actually reminds me of those days and we had the same emphasis on hygiene,# she said. #On the buses there were ads reading #coughs and sneezes breed diseases#. You were told to cough into a handkerchief # there were no tissues in those days.#It was wild # thousands of people died of TB. When the war was over everything was closed like now, but there were plenty of dances and it spread like wildfire. Up the street a whole family of maybe five or six was completely wiped out. It was worse in the city and the streets around here were full of it.#It became known as the Galloping Consumption because it it spread so quickly and you lost weight. There was rationing right up to  so food wasn#t plentul and the houses were small so it spread easily.#But some people thought it was a saints# disease because saints died of it including the Little Flower Sister Theresa who died when she was only .

He said to her: #I#ll put you somewhere where you#ll rest# and they took us all in. We must have all have had TB.#Aged , Bridie was sent to Whiteabbey Hospital, where there was a school for the children. #I was in bed the night the bombs fell,# she said talking about the Belfast Blitz. #The nurse ran into the ward and said #we#ve got everybody but forgot about you, and your sister in the cot beside you!##A lot of the bombs fell into the sea outside and I thought the noise was like the sheets blowing in the wind on Dr Walker#s line # maybe that was the swish of the planes for all I know.#She added: #My brother Anthony was sent home to die when he was just seven # damn the dying did he do # he#s still alive!#She said people were terried of getting TB. #I remember one woman in the street who talked to my mother in an air shelter telling her thatpeople find out she had TB they will cast it up to her and her kids forever.#When I got out of hospital I had one year left to do at St Kevin#s and my teacher Mrs Rocks wasn#t there anymore. I always came first and got presents from her and I wondered why she wasn#t there, but she had got married and had to leave teaching, as that was the rule in those days.#People had a good idea where you had been but no one said a word.#Her mother was to spend nine years being treated in ious hospitals before she died on June   in Musgrave Park. #We were all fit and healthy.

But my mother was moved to the Nissan huts at Musgrave and the doctor took me to the side and told me that the cure came too late for her as her two lungs were gone.

In Northern Ireland, broken down by council district area, Belfast has the highest number of confirmed cases at , according to the latest available data provided by the PHA.The second highest area is Lisburn and Castlereagh with . Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon is placed third highest , followed by North Down and Ardsand Antrim and Newtownabbey in fth place with .Sixth is Fermanagh and Omagh , narrowly followed by Mid and East Antrim and Newry, Mourne and Down with both each having  confirmed cases, placing them joint seventh.Ninth is Derry and Strabane with nine cases, with Mid Ulster and Causeway ranking th and th with seven and five cases respectively. There are also seven cases where the location is unknown.Separate analysis of data, meanwhile, shows coronavirus is most prevalent in Lisburn and Castlereagh , followed by Belfastand Ards and North Down .Outlining his analysis of the PHA geographical spread of coronavirus, Dr Bamford insisted the graphic data fits with how a virus spreads among a population.He told the Belfastit was not surprising areas like Belfast, and Lisburn and Castlereagh, were recording as virus hotspots.It is what you would expect. Those are the areas with the most people, so that#s why there are more cases, explained Dr Bamford.There#s more cases in Belfast because it#s more connected. There#s also a lot of testing areas in the east [of the region].He also warned that actual numbers of people here contracting the virus are likely to be much higher than recorded cases, due to low testing numbers.This [PHA graphic] is based on the number of confirmed cases, and we know that there is going to be at least  times the number of known cases.However, he stressed the numbers could accurately reflect the spread of Covid- across Northern Ireland.These number of cases will reflect the percentage of a total, but they will maybe accurately reflect the picture, said Dr Bamford.Noting the lower number of confirmed cases, largely located in the west of Northern Ireland - indicated on the PHA graphic as white or light pink - the virologist emphasised that council areas with the lowest recorded cases should not be drawn into a  sense of security.Nowhere is safe. If we left this [fight against coronavirus where it is] and didn#t do anything, Derry and Strabane would [go darker on the map] as well as Mid Ulster, he insisted.We#re dealing with a small number of confirmed cases the dference between Derry and Strabane and Mid Ulster [changing from white to pink on the map], for example, could only be a single confirmed case, he insisted.The expert also cautioned against Northern Ireland overall descending into complacency as the lockdown continues.Northern Ireland as a whole is a couple of weeks behind the rest of the UK, even England and London. But we have the potential to reach those numbers and that kind of situationwe ignore the seriousness of coronavirus, said the virologist.Authorities here are making preparations in anticipation of a surge in cases. Work is under way to establish large, temporary field hospitals for coronavirus patients after modelling indicated that the current health service network in Northern Ireland may not have the capacity to cope at the peak of the outbreak.

They thought the embassy might be able to get them shelter or repatriated back home.They came out with leaflets with phone numbers which we#ve all been trying to ring for days but are just left on hold for hours and hours. The Irish Embassy itself was actually closed and there was no one to speak to. Lots of people here have no family support.We don#t know how long this is going to last so they#re all living day by day, not eating or drinking.I#m really worried about the people here, especially the mental health of young people.Dr McGourty does have a flight booked home for this weekend, but this isn#t an option for many travellers who are saving their money.I#m not worried about myself, he said. If anything happened to my family and I can#t be there for them, that would be the worst thing possible.Sinn Fein#s West Belfast MP Paul Maskey has added to the calls for both governments to repatriate citizens.With increased flight restrictions and flight cancellations, citizens are finding it increasingly dficult tohome, he said.Mr Maskey said he welcomed new guidelines from the Republic#s government which helped  peoplehome to Dublin yesterday, including around  doctors. These guidelines include the establishment of a register that will be used to advise Irish citizens ing home and alternative flight arrangements, he said.I would encourage citizens to both read and follow these guidelines. But both the Irish and British governments must do much more and take a more proactive approach to assisting citizens. This is a time of great fear and anxiety for families as Covid- continues to spread, the additional burden of being stranded abroad should not be placed on them.In Peru, hundreds of people have said they fear being stuck for months after two reported cases of Covid- in a hostel saw  tourists placed into quarantine. Many say they face a race against time as hostels are due to close by the end of March.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the first Government-charted flight from Peru arrived back in the UK yesterday.He added he was working urgently with Peruvian authorities to deliver more flights.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When am I allowed to leave the house A. New social distancing rules state that leaving the house should be kept to a minimum or as infrequently as possible, as Boris Johnson said during his televised address.

This should be done alone, unless it is with members of your household.If you provide care or help to a vulnerable person you will also be able to leave home for this purpose.If you are a “key worker”, such as a police officer or nurse, and your child children are attending school, you will be able to dropped them off and pick them up.Q. The UK Government says I must only travel to and from work“absolutely necessary” - how do I knowit is “absolutely necessary” A. All those who are able to work from home have been advised to do so, however for many jobs this is not possible. Those providing essential services or goods will still be able to travel to and from work. Social distancing rules, however, should still be enforced. This means you should stay at least two metres apart from anyone and work gatherings should not take place.Q. Will the children of orced parents be able to visit both of them A. Cabinet minister the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove has confirmed that children under  can move between the households of separated parents, as long as this is normal practice.Q.

All social gatherings of more than two people are prohibited.Q. What businesses are allowed to remain open A. Only businesses providing essential goods or services are permitted to stay open. In the food and drink industry, this includes restaurants operating takeaway or delivery services and canteens at hospitals, care homes, schools and prisons.Facilities offering food or drink to the homeless are also permitted.All retail shops should shut, except for supermarkets and other food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, hardware shops and laundrettes.Pet shops, newsagents and banks can also remain open.Here#s the full list of essential retail services which should continue to trade in Northern Ireland:Supermarkets , convenience stores and corner shopsGrocery markets – not including farmers markets, hot food markets or street food marketsLocal fresh food suppliers like butchers, fishmongers and bakeriesHot food takeaways - over the counter services only and not allowing an option to eat inPharmacies Chemists and Health food shopsDental surgeries, opticians, audiology, physiotherapy, chiropody and other professional vocational medical services – for urgent appointments onlyVeterinary clinics and pet shopsNewsagentsHardware and building supplies storesRetail services in hospitalsPetrol stations, garages, and auto repair shops for urgent work onlyHigh street banks, credit unions and cash pointsPost officesFuneral directors, crematoriums and relatedLaundrettes and dry cleanersStorage and distribution facilities, including delivery drop-off pointsMedical or storage servicesPublic car parks in towns and cities near food takeaway servicesPublic toilets.Businesses that are permitted to stay open have been asked to ensure a distance of two meters is kept between customers and shop assistants, to only let people enter in small groups, and to introduce queue control measures outside the premises.Hotels, hostels and BBs can only remain open for those guests staying while their primary residence is unavailable. Key workers can also continue to stay at such accommodation.Manufacturing and construction firms can continue to operate as long as they enforce social distancing. Ministers say this will be kept under review.Q. What should I domy business is not on the list of essential services A.

How will these measures be enforced A. Police will have the power to disperse public gatherings and issue fines, however it is unclear how officers will monitor whether people are breaking the rules, what action will then be taken, and how much the fines will be.Environmental Health and Trading Standards officers will enforce the rules regarding businesses. Those found to be breaking the rules can be subject to prohibition notices and potentially unlimited fines.Q. How long will the restrictions be in place for A. The restrictions will be in place for at least three weeks, at which time they will be reviewed. At this stage they could be relaxed or tightened.Many have speculated that the restrictions will be in force for longer than three weeks, such as First Minister Arlene Foster.“If I was a betting person, I would say it would continue long after three weeks. It is right we review what are quite draconian measures. But I would imagine it will last longer than three weeks,” she said.Belfast Related ContentVideoCoronavirusCoronavirus: It#s for the best, says Foster as she welcomes Prime Minister#s move to place UK on lockdownArlene Foster has welcomed Boris Johnson#s announcement of draconian new restrictions on everyday le in a bid to tackle the spread of coronavirus.Lindy McDowellOpinionLindy McDowell:Enormity of coronavirus crisis we face is laid bare on day of raw emotion in the AssemblyThese are the choices we are going to have to deal with...

It kicked off that morning, when an acquaintance texted into a WhatsApp group I am in, one with about  members. It was one of those messages we were all plagued by for the first few days of this thing, before peoplecopped themselves on.  This one was from an anonymous doctor , urging people to take ious measures. Most of it was about children. The vectors. Towards the end it got to the grandparents and how they could not be expected to babysit. There followed some discussion in the group over how important this was. Hence my rage. I am a self-employed single mother, supporting my child, and a home, I ranted to the ious friends I rang to talk me out of texting into the group itself, something I knew I would ultimately regret. My parents do not babysit. What they do is so much more. They are helping us to rear our daughter. They mind her to an extent that allows me to earn a living. If I was paying an actual childminder, working probably wouldn#t be worth my while financially. More than that, though: while her father and I co-parent amicably, co-parenting is entirely dferent to having a spouse.

Neither do you go to Ikea or the DIY store together of a Saturday because your child needs a new bed or something in your house needs fixing.I do these things with my parents - my daughter#s grandparents.I#m lucky. I#m so supported that sometimes I feel like a fraud calling myself a single parent. In any given week, my parents will be involved in school drop-offs and collections, in bringing my five-year-old to after-school activities hosting playdates, cooking meals, tracking down suddenly needed new sizes of clothing, and doing bedtime. They live five minutes away my daughter sees them almost every day. Three years ago, my parents got me through my separation, and made it okay to be a single parent, because I never really felt like one, so supported was I. What going through a orce taught me was that you can lose the person you had built a le with, without whom le seemed unimaginable, but that there are still some people in your le who are givens. What the last week has so shockingly revealed is that sometimes the decision to be there, in your le supporting you, might be out of their hands. Suddenly, we were facing into weeks, maybe months, of isolation from them. My father has asthma, so I knew immediately, before the WhatsApp groups cranked into action, that we would need to isolate from them. I was raging, because I was so scared. Everyone going through this has their own particular challenges. I work from home already, so that hasn#t been too much of an adjustment. So far, unlike many of my fellow freelance friends who have, terryingly, seen months of work disappear overnight, I#m busy.But it#s a strange kind of isolation to face into this as the only adult in your house. And the worries we are all facing can feel that bit more intense: finance, isolation, working from home when the children are there. Some single parents will face isolation from their children, for who knows how long. The first few days were fine. I realised quite quickly that I had to be strict with myself. Monitor exactly what I was consuming. In ways, it was freeing: muting WhatsApp groups which threw up links to doom and gloom not getting back to anything but the absolutely essential stuff. When my marriage ended I learned that for a time, when you#re in the midst of huge change and lots of grief, you need to make your world really small. You go off social media at times when you are mentally vulnerable you take things day by day, hour by houryou need. Having a child to focus on gives you a purpose, takes you out of your own mind and the potential vortex of anxiety that awaits there, threatening to pull you under. As the days went on in this past week, I noticed mental buoyancy becoming harder. I didn#t suffer the vicious anxiety I saw paralysing a lot of my friends. More a heavy sadness, like the waves of grief. We#ve had to isolate from my daughter#s father we don#t know when he#ll next see her. The sight of her one night putting her little arms around the phone during their video call and saying cuddle  nearly broke me. Like lots of us, she#s having vivid dreams each night, which she recounts to me every morning. I dreamt granddad collected me for school, she says, and I have to hide my face in the press, pretending to be looking for something so she won#t see the tears in my eyes. I miss granddad, she says a few days in and gets upset. As kids do, five minutes later she appears to have moved on entirely. But I begin to notice an increase in mentions of physical complaints, a regular sore tummy. I find that the time I#m most bothered by the social isolation is when I least want to talk to other people. Friends call and I ignore them, or text saying bad day, won#t risk crying in front of her, speak tomorrow. We video-call my parents and I stay just out of sight of the camera so they can#t see me welling up. When my daughter sees my father she howls grrrraandaaaaad, and I can barely hold it together. The panic comes in waves: when my mother texts late at night to check in when my daughter goes silent and stares into the middle distance. Alright Beanie  I ask her. I miss Daddy, and everyone, she replies. I tell myself, you know how to do this - you#ve been through this before. When your marriage ends, all sense of the future you had imagined disappears and for a time instead the future becomes a scary place. Who knows what it will bring  But I know what that is. Future thinking. Worrying about things yet to come, which may never happen, things you cannot control. By worrying about the future, you risk overwhelming yourself in the present. Stay right here in this moment, I tell myself strictly. Tidy a room. Paint with your daughter. Give her a bath. It#s not all bad, though. As with everything, there is a flip-side. Obviously, adult conversation would be good. But there is something to be said for the company of a joyful five-year-old who isn#t consumed with anxiety. It can be helpful that the face you spend all day looking at isn#t tinged with panic. But then when you get consumed by fear, for her, for yourself, for your family, your work, there#s no one to bounce it off. Not having someone to carry the fear I have and being the only one to carry it for my son… another single mother confides. The nights are the worst. Throughout this first week, I#ve been making regular trips to the kitchen to cry, before heading back in to pretend all is fine.People are lovely. We have a WhatsApp dinner party with my best friend and her family, where the children eat pasta and shout at each other. My cousin and my aunt drop off book parcels for my daughter. I contact the Department of Health to enquire as to the safety of two single parents joining forces. It#s really a case of iniduals now weighing up all the pros and cons of doing something like this against the public health advice of good hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, social distancing, keeping surfaces clean etc. Is everyone currently well  Does anybody have underlying conditions  Has anyone been in contact with a suspected or confirmed case  Is there sufficient space in the house  Answers to these types of questions will help people judge whether the advantages outweigh the risk.It sounds like a yes. Frolo, the networking app for single parents, is facilitating virtual meet-ups, group messaging for members, and providing financial advice.The WhatsApping calms down, but I find I need to still be careful. All that posting of routines online. It#s helpful, I suppose, but dficultyour reality is trying to maintain a full-time career, with no one to take the parenting sht while you work. Do they think all mothers are at home, not working through this  asks one single mother with three children who have been sent home with huge amounts of school work. Mine is five, and I have made an executive decision that she will be fine, whatever amount we do or do not get done. But it#s dficult for single parents with older children. The TV goes on far more regularly than I would like, but I decide to quell the guilt. One morning, on deadline, I look up to realise that she is on her second viewing of her favourite movie that day. She#s figured out the remote. I#m practising an extreme form of #whatever works# parenting, I tell a friend. Suspend your normal rules and rituals around screen time, because you#ve got to do what you#ve got to do. These are not normal times. The normal rules and routines do not apply, Joanna Fortune, psychotherapist and author of  Minute Parenting, tells me.I think single parents are actually better equipped than most to deal with this, one single mother tells me. I for one am used to being trapped indoors when the milk runs out three kids under nine means I can#t leave the house. I am used to online shopping, managing alone. We are better at multi-tasking, better at handling considerable anxiety due to personal struggles. Better at doing everything with kids in tow. I don#t allow my brain to go to what- places.I know what she means. Sometimes, as I#m in the kitchen making yet another snack, a flash of the mind-bogglingly daunting nature of what lies ahead sweeps over me. It might be just the two of us, for months. It was my network that got me through the dficulty of the last few years, when my marriage fell apart and now we are cut off from them.But even though this feels incredibly dficult, and draining, I also know for a fact that there is no way I will go under. I#m exhausted, and frazzled, and crying on and off , but I know also that I am in no danger of succumbing to anxiety over this. I don#t worryabout what I cannot control. In short, I can manage my mind. That is because my friend is right. Single parents have developed a mental hardiness that at a time like now stands to us. A resilience. Another mother confides that she has been sick for the past week, she thinks it is the coronavirus, and she is solo parenting. Are you okay  I ask. She replies that she has parented alone through vomiting flu, so she can handle anything.If you have survived a long relationship falling apart, you#ve had to get on, in the face of it all going to pieces. You#ve had to get up every morning and make it all okay for your children. You#ve coped with work and children overlapping. And even with all the family and friends in the world, you#ve also had to do it by yourself to some extent. You#ve woken up at four in the morning worried over something and comforted yourself back to equanimity. You#ve watched your le as you knew it fall apart and you#ve picked up the pieces and put it all back together. You#ve seen the le you wanted for your children crumble, and had to cope with that, and make it alright for them. It#s dferent, and much scarier, right now, but in ways it is the same. If you are a single parent, chances are you have already proved to yourself you can cope. You have shown your children that you can. It#s incredibly hard right now, and the future is daunting. But you are so much stronger than you might think.Liadan Hynes#s first book, How to Fall Apart, about putting your le back together after the end of a marriage, is published on May .

We are actively seeking to increase that capacity and are working closely with a range of organisations to find the best solution.As part of that work, a request has been submitted for the use of the soon to be decommissioned Kinnegar site near Belfast to be used as the NI Temporary Resting Place, in the event that it is needed.Earlier in the week, DoJ officials told a Stormont committee there was likely to come a point where it would be impossible to adhere to the current practice of holding funerals within three days of a death.As well as an increase in death rate due to the disease, sickness among funeral directors and council staff is anticipated to put added pressure on the system.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadArds bride Kirsten moves big day forward and  guests watch online as they tie the knot during coronavirus pandemicCoronavirus: Sweeping overhaul on the way for hospitals as Northern Ireland prepares for huge surgeMale cyclist dies after being hit by car in MoiraWatch: Mother and son play bagpipes at Spelga Dam in NHS tribute Man accused of stealing £k says it was stolen money, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Sunak said the help, worth up to a maximum of £, a month, would cover % of people who work for themselves. However, the scheme will not come into place until June, with self-employed workers advised to apply for Universal Credit in the meantime.The package was announced after the Government was criticised for initially supporting only company employees. Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce president Ian Henry said: “ offers a leline to the vast majority of self-employed people, many of whom have seen their livelihoods vanish overnight.“I have heard from many sole traders and self-employed people throughout this week. “The Northern Ireland Chamber, along with other business groups, has worked constructively with the Government to ensure the self-employed receive similar support to those who are employed through PAYE.“We welcome the scale of this scheme and recognise the complexities involved in its design. “It is now critical that the Government delivers this practical support as soon as possible.”Economy Minister Diane Dodds and Finance Minister Conor Murphy also welcomed the package.Mrs Dodds said: “This is a much-needed measure which we have been asking for on behalf tens of thousands of people in Northern Ireland.”Mr Murphy added: “While this announcement is welcome, it is concerning that the workers won’t receive this until June.”The support was also welcomed by the Federation of Small Businesses . Spokesman Roger Pollen said the announcement would “give hope to many hard-working, self-employed entrepreneurs”.“Over the last number of weeks, self-employed people have seen support introduced for employee incomes and grants for some businesses but have felt left behind as they have seen their own incomes dry up,” Mr Pollen added.“It is therefore welcome that the Chancellor has brought forward a package for self-employed people. “The FSB has been at the sharp end of negotiations with the Government in recent days, arguing for this package to be as generous as possible.“While what has been announced is not perfect and will not deliver for everyone, it does provide income for our most hard-pressed self-employed — taxi drivers, hairdressers, plumbers, electricians and many more — who will have seen their work disappear as people socially distance. This is an incredibly challenging situation for everyone. While the healthcare response is paramount overcoming the economic disruption also requires a rapid response in the interests of jobs and of future growth.“It is important that the scheme is ready on time and delivered as soon as possible. “As this will be delivered through the self-assessment system, it is vital that any late filers submit their  right now, or they could risk missing out.”Mr Sunak said the Government would pay self-employed people a taxable grant worth % of their average monthly profits over the last three years, up to £, a month.However, people recently made self-employed will not be included in the scheme and must look for welfare support. Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said: “The UK Government has been clear that we will stand side-by-side with the Northern Ireland Executive in doing whatever it takes to help iniduals and businesses through the coronavirus crisis.”Belfast Related ContentNewsCase Study : #Around % of the business has more or less just gone because the gym is closed# Matthew McMahon runs a personal training business, Inside Strength, in Craigavon, Co Armagh.

You have that dark humour.In the book Joanne talks about her pregnancy with Hannah, which was fraught with dficulty as doctors thought she may miscarry again, due to an incompetent cervix.Terriedof losing her baby, she was put in six months of bed rest during the winter of .Their beautul daughter Hannah was eventually born safe and well, following a caesarean section.I had to have a section because she was breach from  weeks, recalls Joanne.The consultant told me thats what saved her from going the same way as Jacob.They said she was standing up in my womb holding on to my ribs.Joanne got pregnant again but the pregnancy was ectopic, a potentially le-threatening complication where the baby grows outside the womb.The baby couldnt survive and the couple were told there was no option but to end the pregnancy.The operation didnt go to plan and Joanne had to have one of her fallopiantubes removed and two blood transfusions.After I came back from surgery I was in recovery for hours and when my mammy saw me she got very emotional.She said I know you want to give Hannah a sibling but you are my child and Hannah needs her motherI said right Lawrence, Im not trying any more. We have to draw a line under it.It killed me.I could still have another baby, but I know mentally that I couldnt cope.Throughout her pregnancies Joanne had been keeping diaries of everything that happened.Ive always written, she says. Even before this book I always joked that I was nursing until I decided what to write about.I wrote a diary after Jacob and I still have it. I suppose its like the mood diaries we use in work so people can see they are getting better.I made a diary of my pregnancy with Hannah and then after she was born I was content and I thought this is great, Im finally a mammy.I loved being in that mammy role and all the funny stuff that happened and I decided I really should keep a diary of all this.Joanne sent her diary to friends who were living in America and Australia as a way of keeping in touch and gradually built up the confidence to show some work colleagues too.One girl at work has a sister who is a blogger The Red Duchess, and she told me I should share it as a blog.I had it all on my computer to show Hannah when she is older anyway so I did it and I thought sure this is lovely.It wasnt until she was forced to take three months off work after breaking her shoulder that Joanne started thinking about turning the blog into a book.She contacted local authors Claire Allan and Felicity McCall for advice and they gave her the confidence to approach a number of publishers.Despite receiving positive feedback, Joanne found the process a bit overwhelmingand decided to shelve the plans for a book to concentrate on her career.Around this time a promotion came up at work and Lawrence encouraged her to go for it.I thought it would be a wee challenge but I was sick nearly every day when I was studying for the interview, she admits.Doubts would pop into my head like well, you were s*** at pregnancy and stuff.I did the interview and it was horrendous. Afterwards I cried so much and I knew it wasnt right.I was always grand at interviews and I never let it get to me. But I was just so low and couldnt get past it.The post came up again and I thoughtI went to the doctors and got something to settle me for the interview I might have a chance.When I went to GP surgery there must have a pregnancy clinic going on and there were pregnant woman everywhere and I felt so emotional.Joanne was seen by a young doctor and explained why she was there, but after reading her notes and listening to her story the doctor told her she didnt think the job interview was the problem.She said Youve had  years of trauma trying to get pregnantShe said Joanne, youre a nurse - youve just bottled this up and done most of this yourself and this interviewhas just tipped you over the edge.Joanne got treatment for her anxiety and kept writing to help her process her feelings and also record all the happy moments with Lawrence and Hannah and her stepson Dylan.Last year, Joanne heard about Jude Morrow, a Derry man with autism who had self-published a book about parenting his son.Judes book was a huge success and climbing up the Amazon best sellers list, so she got in touch to see what he thought about hers.He was hugely encouraging and told her to self-publish,advising her to spend a little money getting a cover designed for the book and to have it professionally edited.Joanne says self-publishing was a journey into unchartered waters, but she had the help of her dad and her self appointed PA Harry McGarvey.Just last week Joanne finally got her hands on the first copy of her book Memoirs of a Mad Mammy, but it was a bittersweet moment because she couldnt share it with Harry who was self-isolating due to the threat of the coronavirus.I left it on the garden wall for him and he was up at the window giving me air hugs, says Joanne.Copies of Memoirs of a Mad Mammy can be pre-ordered now on Amazon.It is also available on Kindle and will be available to buy at Little Acorns bookshop in Derry. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans include prioritisation of patient care, reconfiguration of hospital services, urgent discharge of all medically fit patients, and an end to general hospital visiting – with very limited exceptions. Trusts will also be maximising and utilising all spare capacity in residential, nursingand domiciliary care. The plans are detailed in a letter to Trust chief executives from the Department’s Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly. Mr Pengelly’s letter to colleagues states: “Our health and social care system has never been more needed nor more under pressure than it is today. Right across our system, from top to bottom, people are shouldering this burden and doing all they can to prepare services for the full impact of Covid-. googletag.cmd.push “In that context, I want to start by putting on record my deep gratitude to you and everyone in your teams for the determination, commitment and energy being brought to this daunting task. I hope you all draw strength from the incredible public support that is evident for our health service and all those who work in it.” The letter acknowledges: “Eventhe social distancing measures have the impact we hope, our modelling still indicates that we will require more critical care capacity than is currently available.” Trusts had already moved to postpone all non-urgent elective appointments in order to free up stafffor additional training. googletag.cmd.push The next stage – in the event of the Covid- pandemic moving into dferent phases – will involve further measures to concentrate resources on essential patient care. “In some cases, it is recognised that this may mean that other services are temporarily reduced as the focus is on providing essential services and helping those most at risk access the best possible treatment. “It is therefore suggested that clinicians should begin to categorise patients into priority groups. The lowest prioritisation would be where treatment can be delayed for - months with no predicted negative outcome. Urgent and emergency treatments should continue to be given top priority.” Issues also dealt with in the letter include provision of Personal Protection Equipment , supply of ventilators and other respiratory equipment, Covid- testing, and staff accommodation. “For those staff affected by the -day household isolation policy, staff should - on an entirely voluntary basis - be offered the alternative option of staying in hotel accommodation while they continue to work. This should be organised locally by HSC Trusts.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Coming to the end of that plan, the Executive received advice from the EAG.‘In summary, we would suggest that promoting sub regions within Northern Ireland should not be considered a high priority for economic policy at this time.’That advice, sent to then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster in March , formed the basis of how our economy works on the ground.The North would be seen as one unit so that any inward investor would look at their needs and Belfast would inevitably jump out, the big fish in the medium sized pond.How would that look in real le InvestNI are contacted by a company looking to site a new hub in Northern Ireland, and as a region it looks at us as a whole.It wont be advised to look to the North West, which would inevitably highlight Derry with its IT expertise, broadband connectivity and close access to the EU market, it will see huge Belfast.The last review of economic policy for the North was carried out in , in the midst of the economic crash, pre-Brexit, pre-Trump, pre-City of Culture.Then in  we get the advice of the Economic Advisory Group to rubbish any focus on sub regions.Why then would Derry see its needs addressed  It is policy.We can re-imagine our economy.Derry and Strabane can be the big fish in a smaller pond - Newry and Armagh can do the same.If we get our politicians on board for a vision for the economy that says we are dferent from Belfast, but that doesnt mean we are less - we have dferent talents and we can offer dferent benefits.Lets say from today on we will take that new road and forge the future we can be proud to pass to our children - ending the basis for others to call us whingers by taking on the system that we have a stake in.Belfast cannot compete with us for cross-border connectivity, nor research in AI nor our innovation in health provision based at C-TRIC.What we need is one collective push across ides to re-frame the North West as its own unique region, so it can be promoted for what it has and what it doesThat requires a seismic attitude change.I read recently a mini-furore around how many visits InvestNI have facilitated to Foyle, and for many it reinforces this feeling of being left behind.Instead, we need to change how agencies like InvestNI operate.It operates on the basis that we are one region, where Belfast stands out - but it can be changed.Our politicians need to focus on a new review of the economy that values the dferences we have and the benefits we can contribute.We then as voters need to hold them to account, to end the highlighting of poor performance by the public sector for Derry for highlights sake, and to push as one for real change. googletag.cmd.push  Emmet Doyle is a former advisor to SDLP MLA Pat Ramsey and has written a book called This House Will Divide: A History of the Northern Ireland Parliament - googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Coming to the end of that plan, the Executive received advice from the EAG.‘In summary, we would suggest that promoting sub regions within Northern Ireland should not be considered a high priority for economic policy at this time.’That advice, sent to then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster in March , formed the basis of how our economy works on the ground.The North would be seen as one unit so that any inward investor would look at their needs and Belfast would inevitably jump out, the big fish in the medium sized pond.How would that look in real le InvestNI are contacted by a company looking to site a new hub in Northern Ireland, and as a region it looks at us as a whole.It wont be advised to look to the North West, which would inevitably highlight Derry with its IT expertise, broadband connectivity and close access to the EU market, it will see huge Belfast.The last review of economic policy for the North was carried out in , in the midst of the economic crash, pre-Brexit, pre-Trump, pre-City of Culture.Then in  we get the advice of the Economic Advisory Group to rubbish any focus on sub regions.Why then would Derry see its needs addressed  It is policy.We can re-imagine our economy.Derry and Strabane can be the big fish in a smaller pond - Newry and Armagh can do the same.If we get our politicians on board for a vision for the economy that says we are dferent from Belfast, but that doesnt mean we are less - we have dferent talents and we can offer dferent benefits.Lets say from today on we will take that new road and forge the future we can be proud to pass to our children - ending the basis for others to call us whingers by taking on the system that we have a stake in.Belfast cannot compete with us for cross-border connectivity, nor research in AI nor our innovation in health provision based at C-TRIC.What we need is one collective push across ides to re-frame the North West as its own unique region, so it can be promoted for what it has and what it doesThat requires a seismic attitude change.I read recently a mini-furore around how many visits InvestNI have facilitated to Foyle, and for many it reinforces this feeling of being left behind.Instead, we need to change how agencies like InvestNI operate.It operates on the basis that we are one region, where Belfast stands out - but it can be changed.Our politicians need to focus on a new review of the economy that values the dferences we have and the benefits we can contribute.We then as voters need to hold them to account, to end the highlighting of poor performance by the public sector for Derry for highlights sake, and to push as one for real change. googletag.cmd.push  Emmet Doyle is a former advisor to SDLP MLA Pat Ramsey and has written a book called This House Will Divide: A History of the Northern Ireland Parliament - googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. googletag.cmd.push McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore. “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. googletag.cmd.push McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore. “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rosemarie and Sean Lynn from Dungiven tied the knot in a simple ceremony at St Columba’s Church, Long Tower after their original date fell victim to Covid-. The couple were married last Tuesday evening at :pm, just hours before government regulations banned weddings were due to be introduced. Rosemarie told the County Derry Post they were determined to go ahead with the ceremony. She said: “We got engaged in November and decided we’d get married on the th of April this year. googletag.cmd.push “A few weeks ago, our venue rang and said with coronavirus, they weren’t going to be open. “It was important for us to get married and have family and friends back at the house, so we brought it forward to Saturday the th of March.”  Boris Johnson and the British government had other ideas, however, and Monday’s announcement that weddings were banned left the couple ‘numb’. Things changed when Sean and Rosemarie rang their driver to inform him of the developments. “Brian, our limousine driver and he said: ‘Why don’t you ring the council and see what they can do ’ “So I rang and said we had the papers, we were getting married in the church and the priest was willing to marry us, but we needed the go-ahead from the council. She said to leave it with her. googletag.cmd.push “I was praying to St Anthony when the lady from the council rang back and said we had the go-ahead until  o’clock that night to get married.” The short time frame became even tighter as Rosemarie’s fianceacute Sean finished a sht as an emergency medical technician with the Ambulance Service. “Rosemarie rang and said: you’d better come home quickly because we’re getting married tonight,” said Sean. “I rang the duty control manager and was shocked when they gave the go-ahead for special circumstances. “I had to come home, lt the wean, scrub up quickly and get into the chapel. Of course, she was  minutes late.” Denied the luxury of time that most brides have to prepare for their wedding, Rosemarie was forced to improvise. She said: “I got ready, did my own nails, my own make-up, put the fake tan on, did the whole thing myself. “I had a wee dress I got last year that I just loved. It wasn’t even meant to be for a wedding, I just bought it because I liked it. “It felt like I was in a film. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited, but it was almost an out-of-body experience.” The couple’s faith was central to their decision-making, and both were delighted with the simple ceremony. Sean said: “I’m over the moon, I really am. “The big day would have been great to have, but the sacrament between me, her and God was the main thing.” “The ceremony was beautul,” said Rosemarie. “It was the two of us, the priest, two witnesses and Sean’s wee boy and we all had to stand six feet apart and sit six feet apart in the limousine because of the regulations. Although the couple were able to celebrate with a few drinks at Sean’s house, the honeymoon is on hold as he helps battle the threat of Covid-. He said: “We have a few days to spend together and keep le simple. I’m going out to C every day, so I’m glad for a few hours of something positive.” Rosemarie is hugely proud of her husband’s role. She said: “He’ll be back out in a few days saving lives, that’s what he loves to do. “He always was that kind of person who cares for people, and that’s what it’s all about now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can. We are very lucky to have an amazing team at DCU, letrsquos appreciate and respect them as they try to continue to provide a service to members.ldquoThe support for my staff has been phenomenal.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities. But there was a dramatic U-turn on Monday when these two popular facilities also went into lockdown.Across the district a range of community events have been cancelled with last Sundayrsquos horse race meeting at Downpatrick taking place behind closed doors, with spectators locked out.The local authority want people to obey self-distancing requirements with its decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park further evidence of its concern about people spreading the virus.It is clear that both facilities have now been placed in the ldquohigh risk category alongside the districtrsquos leisure and community centres.

It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

Lorries were out of the question, as drivers often have to load their vehicles, so when I say the advert for bus drivers I thought I would apply, said Noelene.ldquoI never thought it possible that they would accept me, so it was a pleasant surprise when I was offered the chance to attend the Ulsterbus training school.

He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
