They were welcomed by co-head teachers, Stephanie Shaldas and Edmund Coogan, and were introduced to some of the youngest pupils at a play session.Kate, in a pink Max \u0026amp Co coat, knelt down to talk to children in a pop-up cafe, while William helped a girl building a wall in the playground\u0027s construction area. Later he sat on a raised floor talking to a little boy who was brandishing a clipboard as Kate went to a water play area and then joined children in a sand pit hunting for treasure.\u0027Is it fun to be back with all your friends?\u0027 she asked them.Kate and William then joined teachers and staff involved in the Mentally Healthy Schools project to talk about its aims and impact on children.They sat in a circle outside the school because of Covid restrictions. After the television reporter\u0027s questions were fired at William, it looked as though he may have apologised to Miss Shaldas for bringing his family\u0027s traumas into the playground.Andrea Silvain, a deputy head at the 1,200-pupil free school, said the last year of lockdowns had brought teachers and parents closer together and families had appreciated the help that the mental health website had given.\u0027We\u0027ve had some very positive feedback from parents,\u0027 she said.\u0027People have been through this lockdown together,\u0027 William replied.Children at School 21, which educates around 1,200 pupils aged from four to 18, will be given access to lessons on issues such as anxiety and depression.Ironically, the lessons are on a website financed from an initial £800,000 grant from the then royal foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.Kate has championed the idea of early intervention by experts to help children struggling with mental health problems. "},{"url":null,"title":"Law banning schools insisting parents buy branded uniforms moves step closer","story":"Share this articleLaw to end school uniform rip-off and save parents up to £340-a-year backed by MPs -

more than from any other country - and the tourism industry accounts for 13 per cent of the Cypriot economy.Arrivals and earnings from the sector plunged on average 85 per cent last year.It comes amid discussions around EU Covid certificates intended to free up travel in the continent. Draft documents indicated that any certificate must prevent discrimination against those not vaccinated by including information on whether people have been tested or have recovered.The European Commission is expected to release its final proposal for Covid \u0027green digital certificates\u0027 next week, with southern countries reliant on tourism hoping they will open up this year\u0027s summer season.But they ran into opposition from countries including Germany and Belgium, which said vaccination is neither obligatory nor currently available to all those willing to accept it.While the proposal aims to \u0027facilitate free movement\u0027 during the pandemic, it says any proof of vaccination must not discriminate against those who refuse the shot or cannot get inoculated.It remained unclear how this would work in practice, as member states would still need to decide how people who did not have evidence of vaccination would be treated if they wished to cross frontiers.The draft also leaves it up to the 27 member states to make a call on waiving travel restrictions only for those vaccinated with shots authorized for the whole bloc by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or also for people who received jabs allowed unilaterally by specific countries.Hungary and Slovakia have already bought the Russian Sputnik vaccine despite it not being authorised by the EMA. The agency has recommended four Western vaccines for use so far.With competing goals for the proposed Covid certificates, EU leaders - much criticised for a slow vaccination roll-out - are expected to have a heated discussion on the proposal later this month."},{"url":null,"title":"EU Competition Commissioner says Google faces large investigation advertising business","story":"Share this articleBloomberg -

My apologies to Gary Naylor and co.”Burnley deserve their win completely. They were the better side for the entire match, with McNeil, Wood and Vydra all superb in attack. At times, especially during the first half, they played some exceptionally attractive football. Their three points consolidates their 15th place they’re now on 33 points, five ahead of Newcastle in 16th and seven clear of the relegation places. Everton by contrast were flaccid, and while their home form isn’t quite as absurd as the run currently being endured by their good pals over the park, four defeats in their last five league matches at Goodison is a dismal return. It’s seriously compromised their bid for Europe. They remain in sixth on 46 points fifth-placed West Ham have two extra points and a game in hand.The whistle goes, and that’s a huge three points for Burnley in their battle to avoid the drop! They’re surely too good to go down.90 min +3: Pieters and Westwood both hit the turf, requiring treatment as the clock ticks on. While we wait, Sky co-commentator Jamie Carragher names Dwight McNeil as man of the match. A fine choice.90 min +2: Up comes the keeper! What a story this could be! Digne takes. Burnley clear, though not quickly enough to aim for the unguarded goal. But that’s all they need to do.90 min +1: The first of three extra minutes passes by without too much incident ... until Keane slides a pass down the right, behind a snoozing Brady. Coleman wins a corner.90 min: Keane barges into the back of Rodriguez, who is more than happy to purchase the free kick. Brady hangs it above the head of the nervous young keeper, who claims confidently. Sweet Virginia.89 min: Gomes drags a shot left to right across the face of goal. He didn’t catch that at all.87 min: The ball breaks to Iwobi, just inside the Burnley box on the right. His snapshot is blocked by Mee. Everton come again. Coleman drives low from the edge of the D. That’s deflected out for a corner on the right. Digne to take.85 min: Pope is booked for taking a professional amount of time over a goal kick.84 min: ... nothing of note occurs.83 min: Iwobi crosses low from the right. Westwood hangs out a leg and deflects out for a corner. From which ...81 min: McNeil drives in from the right and plays a fine diagonal pass towards Rodriguez, who bursts into the box from the left and tests Virginia. The keeper does well to parry clear.79 min: McNeil is bowled over by King, 30 yards out in a central position. Brady decides to test the nervous young keeper, but doesn’t work Virginia, hoicking the ball miles over the bar.78 min: Vydra, who has been excellent today, troops off exhausted. He’s replaced by Rodriguez.77 min: Digne loops the free kick long. Keane flicks on, towards the top right. Just wide. Better from Everton.76 min: ... but they’re not giving up, and Richarlison, having been quiet for a while, turns the jets on down the left touchline. Tarkowski comes across to cynically clean him out. Booking, and a free kick in a dangerous position.75 min: Digne whips a cross in from the left, but there’s nobody in blue to meet it. Pope claims calmly. Everton, having started the second half well, look a little short of ideas now.74 min: Coleman’s first involvement sees him stripped of possession by Brady. He’s very lucky that Keane noticed what was about to unfold, coming across to nick the ball back, before Brady could make hay.73 min: Everton make their last swap of the evening: Coleman comes on for Holgate.72 min: Not for the first time this evening, Burnley will wonder how they haven’t scored a third goal.71 min: Burnley have suddenly turned up the heat. Brady whips a cross from the left. Wood es in, Keith Houchen style, at the far post. Godfrey flicks away just in time. Then from the resulting corner, Mee skims the top of the crossbar with a header! And to complete a triptych of near misses, Vydra twists on the edge of the box, but Virginia smothers his shot just when it looks like squeaking into the bottom right.69 min: Godfrey and the debutant goalkeeper Virginia confuse each other under a Wood flick-on. The ball drops to Vydra, but he’s facing the wrong way and can’t connect when he spins. The open goal remains in tact.67 min: On the bench, Gudmundsson gets some ice applied to his left ankle.66 min: An attacking change for Everton, as King replaces Davies. Meanwhile Burnley make their first sub of the evening, Brady coming on for Gudmundsson.65 min: Vydra clears. Everton have had a lot of possession since the restart, but they haven’t managed to seriously work Pope.64 min: Westwood slides a pass down the inside-left channel to find Wood just inside the Everton box. He considers shooting from a tight angle but instead passes infield to nobody. Everton break at speed and win their fourth corner of the match. Digne to take, from the left.62 min: Calvert-Lewin is nearly released by a simple long ball down the middle from Davies. His touch is heavy, though the ball clanks off his shin and sails through to Pope.61 min: Brownhill and Digne contest a loose ball in midfield. Digne catches Brownhill on the follow-through, hurting himself in the accidental collision. A loud yelp, but after a worrying beat, he’s soon up and about again.59 min: ... Keane nearly hits the corner flag with an attempted volley towards the top right. Full marks for ambition from the former Burnley man.58 min: Out on the right, Pieters barges Richarlison over from behind. Everton load the box. Gomes swings it in, and ...56 min: McNeil tries to release Wood with a cushioned pass down the right, but Keane anticipates the danger and intercepts. 54 min: Iwobi dinks a ball in from the right. Calvert-Lewin tries to trap and spin, but the ball breaks through to Pope. Calvert-Lewin goes over, with Tarkowski on his shoulder, and claims a penalty, but he’s never getting one for that minimal contact.52 min: Everton stroke it around the back, but make no other progress.50 min: Pieters has an opportunity to send McNeil scampering into space down the left, but his pass is way too strong. Goal kick. McNeil is buzzing around in a very progressive style, though, lively, sharp and dangerous.48 min: ... but Burnley only half clear, and the ball is shuttled back to Digne, who crosses wonderfully this time. He finds Calvert-Lewin on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. Calvert-Lewin mistimes his jump and the ball clanks out off his shoulder for a goal kick. Promising early second-half signs for the hosts.47 min: Everton launch an attack in short order, and Gomes creams a long-distance effort towards the bottom right. Pope extends his fingers to tip around the post. Digne’s delivery of the resulting corner is awful ...Everton get the second half underway. No half-time changes. Half-time advertisement. Sign up now!That’s the end of a glorious half of football. Everton could easily have had a couple more Burnley could have helped themselves to a hatful. Magnificent fun, with the promise of plenty more in the second half. Go nowhere, else you may live to regret it, like poor Justin Kavanagh: “Great. I spend 90 minutes watching the non-materializing goalfest at Elland Road, so decided enough footie for one day and go out to walk the dog. I get back, drowned by the rain, to find a three-goal thriller is unfolding in the BURNLEY game, with a goal-of-the-season contender.” See you in 15, then!45 min +3: Earlier in that move, Lowton slid in heavily on Davies, and now he’s booked as a result.45 min +2: Burnley have been by far the better, more dangerous side. Yet their lead is precarious, and Iwobi nearly sends Calvert-Lewin free with a sliderule pass down the middle. The Everton striker is denied the chance to level the scores by Mee’s excellent hook clear.45 min +1: McNeil slides a pass down the left for Vydra, who tiptoes along the byline, but can’t find anyone with his cutback.45 min: Almost immediately, Virginia is called into action, Gudmundsson teeing up Brownhill on the edge of the Everton box. He handles the low drive very confidently. That was Burnley’s tenth attempt on goal! It’s been one hell of a first-half performance, especially in the context of their goalscoring record away from Turf Moor: just eight all season before today.43 min: Pickford has done his best, but he can’t continue. He’s replaced by Joao Virginia. The 21-year-old from Portugal makes his Premier League debut.42 min: Allan curls long from a deep position on the left. He very nearly releases Calvert-Lewin, who can’t control properly, allowing Pieters to guide the ball back to his keeper.40 min: This is relentless. Burnley ping it around aesthetically yet again, teeing up Brownhill, whose creamed shot is deflected out for a corner. Everton deal with the set piece easily enough.38 min: Westwood is booked for climbing on Calvert-Lewin’s back as the Everton striker tries to bust down the inside-right channel. Free kick, which Calvert-Lewin meets, six yards out, only to blaze his header over.36 min: Burnley sweep down the middle yet again, McNeil, Wood and Vydra combining with some cute triangles. McNeil tries to curls goalward again. Godfrey blocks, his arm up, but Burnley aren’t getting a penalty for this either. This one is more understandable, McNeil having really hit that at him hard, at close proximity. But that won’t improve Burnley’s mood.35 min: Tarkowski is beyond annoyed, having been blocked off by Iwobi when attacking a free kick, then being hit by Westwood’s shot while prone on the edge of the Everton box. He rants at the referee a bit. The referee pays no attention.33 min: The Everton tails are back up. Richarlison glides towards the Burnley box and aims for the bottom right. Pope does extremely well to smother. A great game, this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eada073d93892180a8ec04bb7abb3c5f710379ca/0_138_1196_773/master/1196.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=61868e8cbac8fe15c0e2bd5b427a252c\" height=\"773\" width=\"1196\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"css-uk6cul\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"css-xe26t6\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"css-199x13h\"\u003e\u003csvg width=\"11\" height=\"10\" viewBox=\"0 0 11 10\"\u003e\u003cpath fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M5.5 0L11 10H0z","title":"covid retirement plans state pension age","story":"Thousands will reach the state pension age this year but many are reassessing the futureFor some people, finishing work for good is an appealing idea, with the prospect of travel, spending time with family and enjoying hobbies. But retiring during a pandemic is a different matter entirely.Travel isn’t currently an option, and for months Britons have been restricted in what they can do and who they can meet. And aside from being physically prevented from fulfilling their dreams, for many on the verge of retirement, Covid-19 has had a financial impact, too.In 2021 about 680,000 Britons will reach state pension age, according to the Office for National Statistics, but the coronavirus means many are having to think again about when, or even if, they can stop work.Emily Andrews, the senior evidence manager at the charity the Centre for Ageing Better, says older workers are being forced to “rethink their retirement plans altogether”.“Many are losing their jobs at a crucial life stage and may struggle to return to work,” she says. “Some are bringing forward retirement because they can’t find work, or delaying it because their ability to save has been compromised by the crisis.”Research by the Interactive Investor website indicates one in five people aged 60-65 believe they will need to delay retirement. Its Great British Retirement Survey of 12,000 adults also revealed about one in four feared they would never be able to retire.Among people at retirement age are thousands of furloughed workers: more than 1.28 million over-50s were being paid through the government scheme at the end of January, of which 181,600 were over 65.“We are seeing people putting retirement savings on hold in response to the pressures of the pandemic, including reduced income on furlough,” says Emma Byron, the managing director of Legal \u0026amp General Retirement Solutions.Alongside people on reduced incomes are those who have lost their jobs. The number of people aged 50 and over who were unemployed for more than 12 months was 124,000 in the three months to November 2020.Calls are growing for the government to tackle the impact of the pandemic on older workers. Caroline Abrahams, the charity director for Age UK, says the government needs to do more to help them back into employment after redundancy, “such as by extending the Kickstart scheme so they can take advantage of it, too”.At present, the £2bn Kickstart scheme funds job placements for young people claiming universal credit. Employers cannot claim it to help over-50s despite them being more likely to lose their jobs.Stuart Lewis, a general manager at Rest Less, says: “The recruitment process is where age discrimination bites hardest, and the amount of people out of work during the pandemic has made this worse.”Abrahams says: “As ever, it’s those in the lowest-paid jobs, with few assets to fall back on, for whom the transition to retirement is now likely to be especially hard.”As well as having less to put into a pension, some nearing retirement may have started to use their funds earlier than they had anticipated.Helen Morrissey, a pension specialist at Royal London, says over 55s who are able to access their pension “could dip into it to supplement their income … This will affect the size of their pension and could mean they have to revise plans or delay retirement.”Meagre state pension provision is already resulting in many being forced to work beyond state retirement age, which rose to 66 for men and women in October 2020. The full state pension amounts to £9,100 a year, based on a worker’s national insurance contributions record.Becky O’Connor, the head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor, says: “Increases to the state pension age are saving the government money but the personal cost of these rises can be significant to those due to retire.”A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions says: “Older workers are a huge asset to this country and we have dedicated support to help them back into work through our Plan for Jobs and our 50 Plus: Choices offer.“Our older worker champions are specialists at supporting this experienced group to find new opportunities, including retraining on our sector-based work academy programme, and we are launching a series of mentoring circles that will help boost their network, job search skills and confidence.”“I don’t know if my job will be sustainable,” says Vaknine, from Edgware, north London. “But I can’t possibly afford to retire and I’ve had to cash in a few smaller workplace pensions when it was getting difficult.” She still has a small private pension but has stopped paying into it.She will receive her full state pension of £175.20 a week from June.“I don’t want to look for a new role because of my age. If needs be, I’ll have to, though – we wouldn’t be able to survive. My husband has a very small pension,” she says.“Saving is pretty hard at the moment and the future feels very daunting for my age group. I’ve no plans for retirement – I’ll carry on until they carry me out.”John Lovell, 66, has delayed his retirement after “everything went wrong”. He was due to retire in October 2020 but was forced to change his plans.He is aiming for a total retirement income of about £40,000 a year from his self-invested personal pension with AJ Bell Youinvest, and a few company pension schemes.“The market crash last year had a massive impact on my pension,” says Lovell, who works as a sales manager for a software company. “I need to wait for it to recover.”The pandemic has meant he no longer has to travel so much as part of his job. “At least this made delaying retirement a bit easier,” he says.“I’ll hopefully retire next year – and want to travel from Moscow to Beijing on the train, stopping off in Mongolia. I’d rather retire with less then than carry on to get more – you could die a week after you retire. You just don’t know.”Bob Jones, 68, had plans to cycle across Europe to kick off his retirement in January 2020. “I’m a cycling enthusiast and wanted to see 11 countries in Europe on a six-week trip,” he says. “But the pandemic put paid to this, and retirement, so I started another business instead.”He spent the first lockdown completing six online courses to brush up on his marketing skills, before founding Originality, a marketing consultancy for electronic component companies. Some cash that was to be put towards retirement has been used to support his new venture. “We’re blessed not to have to worry about immediate earnings now,” he says.He hopes to plan a big cycling adventure for 2022 with his wife and twin 18-year-old son and daughter, travelling from Melbourne to Sydney and across New Zealand. “It was disappointing that I couldn’t do the original trip but compared with the suffering going on, I’ve accepted the reality of the situation,” he says.Check for missing fundsThe Department for Work and Pensions estimates that there could be 1.6m lost pension pots, containing a total of £19.4bn. The government offers a scheme to track down lost pensions at gov.ukfind-pension-contact-details.Delay taking your state pensionMake use of pension freedomsFrom the age of 55 you can do what you want with your retirement savings: you can draw an income, buy an annuity, take a cash lump sum or a combination of these options. Making the best use of a mixed approach to your retirement income could boost your income, and an adviser can help with this.According to the consumer group Which?, the difference between the cheapest and most expensive plan for drawing income from a £250,000 pension is £12,300 in charges over a 20-year period. Make sure you check fees before signing up to anything.Inform your pension providerIf you are considering delaying your retirement, tell your workplace pension provider in plenty of time. “This will prevent your pension moving into lower-risk assets such as bonds too early, and missing out on further opportunities for growth,” says Maike Currie, an investment director at Fidelity International.There are plenty of free resources out there that can help you plan for retirement. For example, Legal \u0026amp General has developed a free course with the Open University, Retirement Planning Made Easy. To understand how much you need to retire, use one of the many online calculators, such as Fidelity’s comprehensive My Plan.You can speak to the government-backed free guidance service Pension Wise about any concerns. You can find out what you are on track to receive from the state pension, and when it will be paid, by using the government’s online forecast tool at gov.ukcheck-state-pension."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cd57b8ee80935257686762d77322f85cb0fc7b3/0_246_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3413dff135144abdd5e84daefb2b6d46","title":"the great global vaccine divide podcast","story":"The speed at which the world’s scientists have managed to create several effective Covid vaccines has been close to miraculous.

But now as her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and the ’s Patrick Wintour explain, having served her sentence she is being threatened with further chargesNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was on holiday in Iran in 2016 visiting her parents with her 22-month-old daughter when she was arrested at Tehran airport and held on what she was eventually told were national security charges. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, tells Anushka Asthana that it was then that the five-year nightmare began. And very soon he suspected that his wife was not merely a prisoner, but a pawn in a geopolitical struggle dating back to the 1970s and an unpaid debt owed by Britain to Iran.  ’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, has reported extensively on the story and describes the deal the UK had struck with the shah of Iran for a consignment of British-made tanks shortly before his downfall. Iran had paid for them but the delivery was cancelled amid the Iranian revolution that installed an Islamic theocracy in place of the shah. Following decades of poor relations and demands for the debt to be repaid, Nazanin was arrested and charged with crimes that the regime presented no evidence for and never explained to her.  Now, with her sentence over and her release confirmed, she is still unable to return to her family in the UK as she is now threatened with further charges. So will the UK finally acknowledge the debt to Iran and pay up to secure her long overdue return?

We were knocked around a bit by the decisions in Wales and our emotions got the better of us. We though France would come out hard and so we had to be with them at half time and we were and got them in the second half. We have to play a faster game now and we are working on that.”“We are disappointed, but we knew it would be tough. We are playing nice rugby and we need to go back to work on Monday as we have a big name next week. Missing the Scotland game was not an issue, we have trained well this week and ultimately England were just better in the end”Anthony Watson is player of the match, and he’s speaking:“The win puts the biggest smile on my face, I’m happy with my 50th cap and man of the match, but the win was the most important thing. We weren’t happy with our discipline vs Wales and we did better this week and that was satisfying. It was a great game of rugby and credit to France as well. We won’t be happy with how we started but, to come away with a win and the way we controlled it at the end we’ll be happy with.”On balance, England marginally had the best of the game and a narrow win for the home side is the right result. France won some crucial penalties in their own 22 in the second half, but it was Eddie Jones’s men that had the nudge for much of the half.Very surprised we didn’t see Ntamack given a chance to exert some of his influence in the last fifteen minutes. In the final attack, France were on the 22 and in a decent position but a slight fumble gave England a knock-on advantage that they gladly and gleefully shoed into touch to bring a titanic contest to an end.78 mins. Ben Earl thinks he’s won a crucial penalty on halfway with a jackal but the ref reverses it when the replay shows he initially had his elbows on the ground. France will have one last attack in the England half. 77 mins. The TMO, correctly, calls it grounded and England are back in front with minutes left after Farrell adds the extras.76 mins. England set the maul from the lineout and under a penalty advantage for collapsing the maul Maro Itoje forces over the line. Ref Brace calls it held up, no try, but has asked Joy Neville in the TMO box to have a look. This is a nail-biter for England.74 mins.  England are again into the French 22, but imprecision sees the ball lost and Dulin puts a monster boot on it under pressure to clear. But he can’t find touch and back come England and they have a penalty just inside the France half. Ford puts it in touch.Dan Robson is on for Ben Youngs.73 mins. England have freshened up their pack by emptying the bench and also brought on Ollie Lawrence for Henry Slade.France have replaced Cretin with Cameron Woki71 mins. Promising attack from England in into the France 22, but a huge French counter-ruck led by Penaud shoves Genge off the ruck and wins a penalty when and English player sticks a boot on the ball illegally.Ellis Genge will take a ribbing for being pushed off by a winger, no doubt.68 mins. Cyrille Baille, who has had a corker, is off for Jean-Baptiste Gros and the replacement’s first job is to hold up an England scrum following a Vakatawa knock-on.65 mins. Elliot Daly’s first job is to turn and defend a Penaud chip over the top. He gathers it and does a great job of running 1o metres out under pressure from the France chase. He boots it clear and Brice Dulin attempts a drop goal from somewhere near Reading which unsurprisingly drops a long way short. Absolutely bonkers effort.Ellis Genge for Mako VunipolaBen Earl for Mark WilsonElliot Daly for Max Malins62 mins. Aldegheri, the new prop for France, makes an instant impact by folding Mako Vunipola and winning a penalty. Jalibert misses touch and Johnny May boots it clear and into touch way back in the France 2260 mins. Ben Youngs snakes up the blindside and chips forward into space, but he puts it out on the full. His first real mistake of a very good game for him so far.59 mins. Subs for FranceDorian Aldegheri for Mohamed HouasCyril Cazeaux for Romain Taofifenua58 mins. The England front row celebrate after winning a penalty as Haouas twists in the scrum, but the home side lose possession soon after as Alldritt targets an isolated Cowan-Dickie at the breakdown to win a blue penalty.54 mins. Ollivon is penalised for playing Ewels in the air at the lineout and Farrell points at the posts, tees it up and makes no mistake.50 mins. Maro Itoje is penalised for not rolling away bang in front of the posts, 25 metres out. Jalibert gratefully steps up and slots it to extend his team’s lead.48 mins.  England are back in the France 22 after a rapid Youngs dart from the ruck puts them on the front foot but Romain Taofifenua clamps on Mako Vunipola in the tackle and wins a crucial penalty for his team.46 mins. Brice Dulin launches and gathers his own kick to put his team back on the attack, but as the ball comes left Charles Ollivon’s pass to Thomas is a good metre forward. Careless from the France captain.44 mins. Ford is dictating an England attack on the 22 and Curry is carrying hard, something he’s done a lot so far. The ball comes right but it’s too lateral and France cover it and force Malins to hold on and concede a penalty.42 mins. We open with a couple of kicks from Ben Youngs, the second of which is a garrryowen that forces a knock-on by France. England scrum just inside the blue half.40 mins. George Ford drop-punts this ridiculous contest back into life.I hope you’ve all had a breather, because the teams are on their way back out..Well, what to say about that?  An incredible half, both teams going for it and certainly won’t be dying with the music in them. France looking creative and deadly anywhere near the England 22, while the home side look powerful, direct and pretty smart in possession themselves.Hard to know what’s to come, and it feels like the introduction of Ntamack will have big impact on the game. This, in essence, is the key difference on the benches as France have a genuine world-class playmaker to come on fresh at some point.40 mins. France have one last dart up the right but lose the ball which allows Ford to chip it out and end what was a bloody brilliant half of rugby.39 mins. Jalibert brings the ball out from his 22 and executes an audacious double sidestep in the space of a phonebox to leave the England kick-chase for dead. A few phases later they are up to the England line after a Teddy Thomas run and it’s only a desperate jackal from Curry to win his side a penalty that kills the attack.My word, what a game.35 mins.  France make a mess of the restart which allows England an attack in the French 22, a kick from Slade is chased in-goal by Farrell but Dulin mops it up to nullify the danger.33 mins.  On first phase from off the top of the lineout Dupont runs around Fickou, regathers the ball and pops it to Jalibert who floats it off his left hand to Penaud to score in the corner. An absolute beauty.Jalibert converts from out wide.31 mins. Malins trundles into the line with the ball but he’s a little isolated and France latch on the win the penalty on halfway.30 mins. The France out-half makes no mistake and that’s just reward for a decent period for the visitors.29 mins. France work some phases in the 22 and England have given away 3 penalties in this attack, all of which are on advantage when Jalibert chases a Dupont chip which he gets to but can’t ground without punching it dead. They come back for their pick of the penalties.27 mins. France have their first period of possession for a little while and they use it to get into England’s half via a strong Fickou carry before a Jalibert angled kick forces Youngs to box-kick away. All this does is bring Les Bleus back at the home team.25 mins. France are simply being overpowered by England at present, both in terms of sheer muscularity in the carry and then in the pace at which they recycle the ball. A small break in play while a scrum sets will give the visitors a welcome moment to reset and when it finally forms Mako Vunipola is penalised for collapsing.22 mins. France win the lineout, but Dupont is slow with the kick to clear allowing Curry to charge it down and Wilson to get down on the ball, but a little knock on will see France have a scrum. 20 mins. What a game this is so far, and crucially England appear to have solved their discipline problem. Ben Youngs again pins France back for a tricky lineout in their own 22.19 mins. Three more points to England from their captain’s boot.18 mins. Watson takes the ball on halfway, cuts inside, straightens up and finds himself free and running onto the fullback. He chips over the top but loses the foot race to the covering Jalibert, who ships it to Penaud to clear. This invites England to come back at them and the home team have another kickable penalty.17 mins.  A break from Marchand sees the hooker show some rapid pace to go thirty metres into the France 22. It looks dangerous but Alldritt can’t get the timing right to receive a pass and knocks it on.15 mins.  And just like that, England are in front.13 mins. France’s response is to overwork the ball in attack, trying to force passes that are too clever and so end up being entirely stupid. Ford pins them back in their own 22 from the boot and England have a penalty for in at the side.This is a ferocious response from England to the early shock.11 mins.  This has been coming as it’s been all England since France’s try. Henry Slade carries through the tackle line and up to within five metres for George Ford to fizz the ball right for a Watson walk in. Farrell adds the extras from wide right.7 mins. From the scrum five England get a push on before going left allowing Billy Vunipola and Sinckler to punch up to the French line. The ball comes right but the pass to Watson from Malins is wild and into touch.5 mins. England’s first possession proper is a very promising, ten-plus phases of solid running from deep and quick recycling seeing them go left and right to bring themselves up to within feet of the French line. Mark Wilson has the last drive over the line but he’s held up by Gael Fickou3 mins.  Brice Dulin fields the first big kick from Ben Youngs to put the visitors on the attack and they’ve up to six phases working it left and right. Teddy Thomas chips it over the top and Dupont is first to it and scores after a little bit of a juggle under pressure.Jalibert converts. What a start for Les Bleus!The teams are taking the field. The pitch looks in lovely nick, it’s a dry early spring day and it’s all set up to be a great contest. “I’m going to suggest that France will find this ‘solid, talented and experienced England outfit’ to be largely predictable in what they do, cheering us with moments of pure talent when the ball is actually passed to the playmakers, but overall let down by sloppy errors and again giving away too many penalties. I hope I’m wrong.”Ugo Monye likes the cut of Max Malins’ jib and I agree with him. See if you feel the same by having a read.What are your thoughts on how this will go? Can England stem the penalty tide? Does anyone actually think Galthie’s glasses are decent? All this and more can be sent my way by email or on TwitterEddie Jones has finally given Max Malins the start his form and class warrant at fullback, replacing the too long misfiring Elliot Daly who moves to the bench for an otherwise unchanged backline. In the forwards, Luke Cowan-Dickie’s abrasive energy and try-scoring record is preferred to Jamie George and Charlie Ewels starts at lock, replacing Jonny Hill. The Bath man’s steady power appears more appealing to Jones early in the match than Jonny Hill’s sometimes unpredictable temperament. Jones has this week gone for three backs on the bench, featuring the return of Ollie Lawrence.It appears that long Covid is not a worry for France as a largely first choice team emerges from their period of isolation. Virimi Vakatawa is back at centre, with Teddy Thomas ad the classy Damian Penaud on the wings. Much of the game with depend on how those two handle the peppering they will receive from England’s kicking game. In that regard, you have to say France will miss the injured Gabin Villière.Romain Taofifenua comes in for the injured Bernard le Roux in the pack, while Dylan Cretin starts in the back row.Keep your eyes on the France bench as Romain Ntamack, their insouciant superstar of 2020 alongside Dupont, will make his return at some point in the game.It’s Saturday, it’s the Six Nations, it’s Twickenham, it’s Le Crunch and this is our live coverage. Hello and welcome.Eddie Jones and Fabien Galthie arrive in south west London today with worries. Differing worries, but worries nonetheless.Jones is troubled that his team are like a penalty vending machine for which thus far his opposition appear to have a plentiful supply of tokens. For all the marked improvement with the ball vs Wales no team can hope to consistently win giving away an average of 13 penalties a match as England have done in this tournament. Refs Wayne Barnes and Matthew Carley have been in camp to try and solve it and whatever impact they have made on the squad will be key to the result.Galthie has other things on his mind. Is my squad undercooked after a COVID layoff? (Possibly). Do the players all hate me after Bernard Laporte blamed them not me for this whole COVID thing? (Likely). Are these glasses too much? (Absolutely). But, more than anything, he will be ruminating on whether this developing squad packed with quality can replicate last year’s win over what remains a solid, talented and experienced England outfit. At least Galthie can relax a little knowing a loss here will not herald a gathering miasma of crisis around his squad. Jones does not have any such succour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e3ccf2d7acb9789881cc36d464ad4e6ed68b573/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=971b44d19f18a48b3b88a73bd0131d3d","title":"can you kick it the definitive womens football quiz","story":"Women’s football has seen its audience rise to a whopping 1.12 billion viewers – but are you one of them?

Playing with her local club from a young age, she knew a big move was inevitable if she wanted to play at the highest level.In fact, it was the young women in the national team, the Football Ferns, who inspired Moore the most.“I think because New Zealand is so remote from everywhere else, I idolised a lot of the girls from our national framework. They’re actually still there now, and I remember when I had my first tour with the Football Ferns and I’d had those players on my wall – then I was going to training with them for the first time.“Players like Abby Erceg, Ria Percival, Amber Hearn, Ali Riley – all those girls were influential because I saw them, and I was like: ‘I want to do that, I want to be in the Football Ferns environment, I want to follow in their footsteps.’”The first leg of her journey was to Germany, where she played first for FC Köln in the women’s Bundesliga during the 2017-18 season. A couple of seasons at Duisburg followed, including a bad injury just ahead of the 2019 Women’s World Cup, before she signed with Liverpool, at the beginning of this season, where she is fitting right in.“Coming from New Zealand, we’re very carefree – we’re just living the life and quite chilled. So I think coming to Liverpool, it’s quite similar to home – you could say there’s a lot of banter between the girls, we get along quite well.”That said, it’s not always easy living so far from home.“I’m quite family-oriented, so that’s a really important thing for me. I regularly keep in contact with my mum and sisters, my grandma – I schedule in weekly video calls, because it’s so important to me. And being so far away, it’s important for me to keep those connections close, to be able to lean on when I need to.”When disaster struck and Moore tore her achilles while training in France ahead of the 2019 Women’s World Cup, she was lucky, she says, that her family was already travelling to Europe on the same day, and so they were present when she woke from surgery.Though Moore realises injury is “part of the game”, a tough time followed as she underwent rehabilitation in Christchurch, New Zealand, afterwards. However, it was in these difficult moments that she realised who the most important figures in her journey were. Her family, and in particular, her mum, who she describes as her “rock”, and says she is on the phone to straight away regardless of the 13-hour time difference, whenever she has a problem.She also hailed her physiotherapist, Tamsin, as a key figure in her recovery.“I couldn’t have done it without her, and I do think you notice in those sorts of times how important the people around you are – how much you can, and need to rely on them to get through it.”But Moore isn’t used to being confined to one place for too long. She loves travel and long journeys – in which she makes sure she always has some good music and a book with her when she’s on the road. But she is getting settled in Liverpool now and, as a big coffee drinker, can’t wait for normality to resume so she can explore some of the city’s cafes.Another thing Moore misses is playing in full stadiums. “The people make the atmosphere, and the people make the game, so to be able to play in a packed stadium again will be pretty cool,” she says.“It’s always nice to be able to play in front of people and hear them cheering behind you, but we know that it’s not possible right now and since coming here I have felt a lot of love.”In terms of where she wants to be next, there is only one destination, she says: “Anfield.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

The goalkeeper talks to Jen Offord about her journey to Liverpool and who’s been with her en routeAt just 22, goalkeeper Rylee Foster has already travelled much of the globe, having visited every continent except Africa. She’s played for Canada under-20s, and spent four years at West Virginia University, but Liverpool has always been her dream destination. With strong family ties to the city, it feels fitting to her that this is where she has started her professional career.“I don’t think I had a choice when I was born,” she says, “I supported Liverpool for as long as I can remember.”Foster’s paternal grandparents were born and raised in the Wavertree area of Liverpool and travelled to Canada after the second world war. Though her father was born in Canada, Foster says the connection to Liverpool never left.“It was something that was in a sense drilled into me as a young kid, watching the matches every weekend with my dad or my mum, and my sisters on the couch,” she says.Her grandparents were also key figures in her early footballing aspirations.“My grandparents used to come to my matches and there were always words of wisdom: ‘Just keep your elbows up and don’t let anyone take you down. If someone comes close just give them a little knock – whatever you’ve got to do to keep strong.’”After her beloved grandmother passed away in 2013, Foster had the words of the famous Liverpool anthem You’ll Never Walk Alone tattooed on one of her biceps in memoriam. It was, she says, a reminder that her grandmother would always be with her.“But it also rooted me into my culture. I just wanted to have that reminder to keep going forward and keep representing my family, but also the Liverpool crest with as much pride as I could.“To be the first one to be able to return back to Liverpool and to have roots here to start something new and carry on the Foster name in the city is an honour.”Foster’s family is clearly as integral to her football journey as much as the physical one she has taken to be here, acting as her cheerleaders and support network.She started playing football around the age of five, when her father took her and her sisters to the local park. These are, she says, some of her fondest memories. But as well as starting her on her journey, her family gave so much and put everything else aside to make sure she was able to fulfil her potential.Not living close to a competitive training ground, her entire family would follow her for the hour-and-a-half journey to practice and back.“My dad would leave early to come and pick me up, my mum would take my sisters and they would miss time with their friends and do their homework in the car.”Given how close they are, and how meaningful her career move is to the entire family, it’s not ideal, says Foster, that they can’t be with her at the moment. Her sisters were able to visit during the year she has been in Liverpool, and her mother also came with her when she first signed with the club. Next, she really hopes her dad will be able to visit.“It’s been a dream for me to make that happen,” she says. “Just be at a match together, for him to see the Kop and be in that experience, that environment, would mean the world to me.”Although Foster hasn’t had much time with the club under Covid-free circumstances, having joined in January 2020, she’s already had a taste of the incredible fanbase Liverpool are known for.“The football culture here is amazing. We talk about the fans, but it’s not even that it’s a thing that they love, it’s like a religion, which is how I’ve felt all my life – so to be immersed in a culture like that is so fun and so cool.”“When I walk on to the pitch and hear You’ll Never Walk Alone, it kind of hits home a little bit more. It actually brings a tear to my eye every time I hear it.”Since she’s been in Liverpool, she’s been impressed by the food culture and lists Bold Street as one of her must-visit places. She’s also enjoyed travelling by foot to take in the historic buildings, particularly around the docks, as well as getting to know her fellow scousers.“If I’m wearing the kit in town it’s an automatic conversation. Other cities I’ve been in, they don’t really care to have that conversation, they kind of look at you and walk by, but people here want to get to know you and know where you’re from. I think it’s so cool to be able to make those connections.”Finally, of course, there’s Anfield itself, which is, in her opinion, “breathtaking”.Though it may have been chaotic at times, Foster is proud to have travelled so much, and is grateful for the opportunities football has given her.“When you’re going there for football you get a different feel for these countries, you don’t get the resort style stuff you get to see the inner cities and what the people are like – you can talk to the people and relate to them. I’m pretty lucky to be able to learn while being able to experience some of the greatest places in the world.”But that doesn’t mean she’s not keen to enjoy some leisurely travel too. She’s looking forward to seeing the Blue Lagoon in Iceland and surfing in Hawaii when things get back to normal. “I don’t think I’d be very good at surfing,” she ponders, “but I’ll try it.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

Now, at only 19, she’s one of Liverpool FC Women’s brightest stars. Here, she talks about the people who have been with her all the wayFor homegrown talent Missy Bo Kearns, playing at Anfield is the dream. Though the 19-year-old’s career may have grown – like many others – from humble beginnings, she is well connected in the local football community, and counts Liverpool royalty Jamie Carragher as one of her confidants.“I think growing up Steven Gerrard was my idol and I always looked up to him,” she says. “But now, I speak to Jamie Carragher quite regularly – he’s my dad’s friend – and he gives me the best advice I’ve probably had in football. He’s always there if I need to ask him anything, and I know he’s been there himself.”If that wasn’t enough, Kearns also credits Lioness, Atlético Madrid forward and ex-Everton player Toni Duggan as having been instrumental in her career. Duggan was a huge source of inspiration to the young footballer, having attended the same youth club in Liverpool.Kearns started playing football at the age of four with her cousins in the garden, and joined a local team with her cousin. She trialled and signed for Liverpool at the age of eight, and worked her way through each of the age groups at the club before breaking through into the first team last year. Though, it could have been different for the midfielder.Female role models are important in this game, with the age-old adage: if you can’t see it, you can’t be it – and Kearns hopes to return the favour one day.“Knowing what Toni has done for me, if I can do that for other young girls, that’s amazing – it’s got me where I am today. So if I can help, I’d love to.”Another important female figure in her football journey is her grandmother, who she says she has successfully converted to the beautiful game.“Believe it or not, she never used to watch football,” Kearns says. “But now she’s starting to get into it more. She used to watch when it was just me, but now she’ll watch actual games on the TV.”Kearns’s grandma also fulfilled the role of backroom staff as well as fanbase, and would pick her up from school, get her ready and take her to training. Several times a week, whatever the weather, she was always ready to help.“If she’d not done that while my parents were at work, I wouldn’t be where I am today. I’m grateful for what she’s done for me.”Like many of her fellow Liverpudlians, Kearns is an avid football fan, as well as a player, and is part of what she thinks of as “one big family”.“I was watching football in the house before I even played it. I was going to Anfield, so I’ve been brought up into football and I think being a Liverpool fan, it makes you want to follow football more because of the passion and how big a club it is. It’s just unbelievable when you’re in the stadiums feeling it, home and away, how much it actually means to the fans watching the team.”In her free time, as well as hanging out with friends in the city, and particularly the Royal Albert Dock, Kearns is a regular in the stands at Anfield, and appreciates the role of fans both as a player and supporter.“I think for us, as the women’s team, when the fans are there you feel like you’ve got more players on the pitch. You feel privileged that they’ve come out to watch you and support you.”Kearns has big aspirations for her career, hoping to get Liverpool back into the Women’s Super League, and hopefully winning some trophies.When she’s on the road now, to the slightly less exotic locations of Charlton in south-east London, and Maiden Castle in Durham, you’ll most likely find her with best friend Jade Bailey on the team bus, and she takes her PlayStation 5 with her everywhere to “relax”, she says. She hopes there might be some longer journeys in the future, though.“There’s loads of places I’d like to play,” she says, quickly clarifying, “as an away team, though.”Anfield is the dream, she says, but she thinks Barcelona’s famous Nou Camp would be a “good experience”.

They were hospitalised and died 28 January 2021,” the National Health Institute said in a statement reported by Reuters.Colombia has banned flights to and from Brazil as part of efforts to stop the spread of the more transmissible variant.In the UK, more than a quarter of people who receive social care from the NHS have seen their health deteriorate during the coronavirus pandemic, according to research.The CSA reported that older and disabled people had been left struggling with daily activities and were missing medical appointments, and a quarter of those who said they had trouble carrying out daily activities reported that they were not given help by authorities when they asked for it.Italy will step up its Covid-19 vaccination programme to hit a target of administering 500,000 doses each day, the country’s coronavirus special commissioner said on Saturday.Artists in Athens held a protest for their rights to work, almost a year after the first lockdown with the closure of theatres, museums and cinemas.Football fans were offered a Covid-19 vaccine at the Russian Premier League match between Zenit and Akhmat Grozny in St Petersburg on Saturday.People were offered a free shot of the Sputnik V jab for two hours before and after the game in an effort to increase take-up. A Reuters reporter said that at least 20 of the several thousands attendees were vaccinated.Take-up of the vaccine in Russia has been slower than in other countries, with polls showing Russians are sceptical of the domestically produced jab. A total of five million people have received a first dose, out of a population of 144 million, the deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova said last week.Zenit said the vaccination programme at the stadium would continue until the end of the football season. The trauma of watching thousands of patients die during the Covid-19 pandemic will force many intensive care staff out of healthcare unless they get substantial mental health support, the charity that represents ICU workers has warned.The Intensive Care Society said half of ICU staff needed psychological support to help them deal with their experiences and added that some had already left their professions.“This pandemic is the greatest crisis we’ve seen in a century,” said Dr Stephen Webb, the ICS president. “There is a danger that we will lose further staff in the future. We know there’s a risk of people falling ill, wanting to leave – not just intensive care but healthcare completely.”A further 369,578 first vaccine doses have been administered in the UK, taking the total to 23,684,103. A total of 1,532,754 people have had both shots – a rise of 87,676 on the previous day, according to government figures.Italy reported 317 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday , the health ministry said. There were 307 last Saturday.The daily tally of new cases was 26,062, compared with 23,633 the Saturday before, according to Reuters.Italy has registered 101,881 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after the UK and the seventh-highest in the world. The country has reported 3.2 million cases to date.There have been a further 5,534 lab-confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK, according to government data – compared with 6,039 cases last Saturday.A total of 4,253,820 people have tested positive since the pandemic began.A further 121 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, bringing the total to 125,464. There were 158 deaths last Saturday.According to the government dashboard, a delay in receiving information on deaths in England from one of its data sources “might have a small impact on the total number of deaths reported” on Saturday. The delay will be reflected in the numbers published on Sunday.Headlines in today’s coronavirus-related news from around the world include:That’s it from me, Damien Gayle. Three health workers in Norway who recently received the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19 are being treated in hospital for blood clots, Reuters reports, citing the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Norway halted on Thursday the rollout of that vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit. Austria has also stopped using a batch of AstraZeneca shots while investigating a death from coagulation disorders and an illness from a pulmonary embolism. Earlier, it was reported that the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which recently received 1.7m doses of the Oxford University-developed jab, was postponing its vaccine programme. And in India health authorities are also conducting a review of potential side-effects.Sigurd Hortemo, a senior doctor at the Norwegian medicines agency, told a news conference held jointly with the Norwegian institute of public health that it was not known whether the latest cases, all in iniduals under the age of 50, were linked to the vaccine. The European medicine regulator EMA would investigate the three incidents, he added. According to Steinar Madsen, medical director at the Norwegian Medicines Agency, the three patients had “very unusual symptoms” including “bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets”. “They are quite sick ... We take this very seriously,” he told the broadcaster NRK, adding authorities had received notification of the cases on Saturday. More than 21m vaccination doses have now been administered in England, according to the latest official figures. Provisional NHS England data published on Saturday showed that a total of 21,187,615 Covid-19 vaccinations took place between 8 December and 12 March, a rise of 380,230 on the previous day. Of these, 20,111,189 were the first dose of a vaccine, a rise of 312,716 on the previous day, while 1,076,426 were a second dose, an increase of 67,514.Police in Austria having been blocking the exit of anyone from a city of 45,000 people who is not in possession of a negative coronavirus test result. A new rule that came into force on Saturday restricts people from leaving Wiener Neustadt without first being tested for the virus. Police officers and other officials were stationed on 26 roads leading out of the city south of Vienna, checking drivers’ papers. Rule breakers face fines of up to €1,450.The rule was imposed after the rate of infection in the city rose to more than 500 per 100,000 inhabitants over seven days, compared with a national average of 198 per 100,000. Klaus Schneeberger, the city’s mayor, said testing stations set up in recent days have a capacity to test 15,000 people per day. According to the Associated Press he said he didn’t understand why Austria’s health ministry “doesn’t use this occasion to start a vaccination campaign here so we get this under control.” A targeted campaign to vaccinate the entire adult population is underway in the Schwaz district in western Austria, which has seen a significant number of cases of the more contagious virus variant first detected in South Africa.Coronavirus infections in Germany could again reach peaks seen around Christmas by mid-April, public health officials have said.The Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases predicted that the number of daily reported cases could exceed 30,000 in the 14th week of the year starting 12 April.  “An extrapolation of the trends shows that case numbers can be expected above the Christmas level from week 14 onwards,” the RKI said in its current situation report. Authorities in Hong Kong are to impose compulsory coronavirus testing for staff of a cluster of law firms and banks after most of the 47 new cases recorded on Saturday were linked to a gym used by the financial and expatriate communities. Thirty-five of the new cases were linked to an outbreak at Ursus Fitness, a gym in the city’s Sai Ying Pun district, the city government said, according to Reuters. So far 99 cases have been confirmed as related to the centre, which is popular with expatriate lawyers, bankers and hedge fund executives, the health department said in a briefing.  The government published a compulsory testing notice on Friday covering 80 residential premises and workplaces, many in central financial and business district. Among the workplaces affected were offices for Shearman \u0026amp Sterling, Allen \u0026amp Overy, Herbert Smith Freehills, HSBC, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon. Hong Kong has recorded around 11,200 total coronavirus cases, far lower than other developed cities. The city of 7.5 million people launched its vaccination programme in February, with 162,100 people receiving their first shot so far.

It was co-ordinated by Nottingham Women for Change and Nottingham People’s Assembly, who said “extensive preparations” were made to ensure the event was safe, socially distanced, and effectively managed.Two police officers were spotted among the crowd as they watched proceedings unfold but did not intervene while Nottinghamshire Live was at the vigil.My colleague Libby Brooks has been at the vigil in Glasgow, talking to women about what brought them out to George Square this evening. She writes:Melanie McKinley, 28, a student paramedic said Sarah’s death struck a chord with most of the women she knows.I don’t know why. When we got here, you just felt the emotion. There’s been an online outcry, but here you can see it on a local scale and it feels more real. You can’t ignore it.Standing with McKinley in front of the tributes is her friend Lauren Orsi, also 28 and a retail manager, who said: Even though I know this doesn’t actually change the situation, it feels like something you can do to support your fellow women. It’s been a rough week for women and you realise we have so, so far to come. Sometimes you can sit back and think women have come a long way, but there’s so far to go.Misara and her friend Rana, both 19, were passing the square when they realised that tributes were being left for Everard. Misara said:I wanted to come and pay my respects. I know what it’s like to feel unsafe with male attention.“For me it’s frustration,” says Rana. This has been happening for a long time. Why are we talking about it now, why not 10 or 15 years ago, why not when it happened to other women? It’s not acceptable.Here is the clip of the Duchess of Cambridge as she visited Clapham Common earlier, looking at notes and flowers left in tribute to Sarah Everard at the bandstand.The home secretary Priti Patel said that almost 20,000 people have responded in just 24 hours to a consultation on how the government could tackle violence against women and girls.Patel added that she will also be lighting a candle tonight in memory of Sarah Everard.The call for evidence was reopened on 12 March to reflect the conversation about women’s safety in light of Everard’s death. Its aim is to further collect views from those with lived experience of, or views on, crimes considered as violence against women and girls. You can make a submission here.Sandi Toksvig opened the online vigil for Sarah Everard, expressing her “profound sorrow and rage”.Speaking at Feminists of London’s virtual event, which is being live-streamed on YouTube, the television presenter said: The truth is of course I don’t want to be here at all, I do not want to attend a vigil for a bright young woman in her early 30s, a woman with her life before her.I do not want to be here talking about the memory of Sarah. I have two daughters about the same age as Sarah. Tomorrow is Mother’s Day. Never have I felt more passionately concerned about my kids.It surely cannot be asking too much to want them simply to be free, to walk where they like, when they like.I am filled in equal measure with profound sorrow and rage, and I know there are many who share this rage and I think it is entirely justifiable. But I also know that it will harm rather than help us if we don’t try and direct that anger to good purpose.Tonight we reflect that when the vigil is over, the work begins.This is from Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem MP for St AlbansHow are you marking the vigil this evening?

They met together in person for the first time at George Square on Saturday evening.Nimmo-Smith said that collecting and reading the messages left by women around Glasgow, many of them describing their own experiences of harassment and assault and the fears that accompanied them, had been “very emotional”. She said that the first ribbon had been left at 8am this morning and that many women had taken the opportunity to attend the four sites as part of their daily walk.She added that the messages would be collected together and exhibited online “to show what women go through on a daily basis”. Speaking to male friends over the past few days it has been clear they’ve had no idea what women go through. Reliving these experiences has been traumatic and triggering but we hope that by bringing together women’s voices there can be change.At three other sites across Glasgow in Queens Park on the city’s south side, Kelvingrove Park in the west end and at the Mary Barbour statue in Govan, there were similar scenes. After the Reclaim the Streets vigil was officially cancelled, hundreds of people have visited Clapham Common to lay flowers, adding to the growing floral tribute at the bandstand, and pay their respects to Sarah Everard. Sisters united will never be defeated.” Some held placards reading “we will not be silenced”, and “she was just walking home”.With police urging people to stay home and commemorate the life and death of Sarah Everard remotely, organisers have taken their vigils online. Here’s how to remember her from home:A number of groups are hosting virtual vigils, the largest of which appears to be a collaboration between Reclaim These Streets and Feminists of London. They have organised an event from 6pm, with speakers Sandi Toksvig, the Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the Guilty Feminist podcast host Deborah Frances-White, the Women’s Equality party leader Mandu Reid, and Reclaim These Streets organiser Jamie Klingler. Starting at 6pm, it will be live-streamed on Reclaim These Streets’ YouTube channel, and will feature “readings and contributions from the community.”The Belfast branch of the campaign group Reclaim The Night, which has protested against street violence against women and girls in the UK for more than 40 years, has also organised an online vigil. Attenders are advised to email RTNBelfast@gmail for the link to join the event, which also began at 6pm. Edinburgh organisers are also hosting an online vigil.Flowers and ribbonsAcross the UK, mourners have been leaving flowers in memory of Sarah Everard. In London, they have centred on the bandstand at Clapham Common, close to where Everard was last seen, but flowers are also being left at other sites, including at the steps of the old palace site in Crystal Palace.In Glasgow, organisers have encouraged people to tie ribbons to railings and lamp-posts to remember Everard and protest against violence against women, centring on four designated areas: George Square, the Mary Barbour statue in Govan, Kelvingrove park and Queens park.Good evening. Welcome to the live blog, where we’ll be bringing you all the latest updates from the Reclaim These Streets vigils aimed at calling attention to women’s safety issues that are taking place across the UK this evening.While the London vigil, which had been planned for 6pm on Clapham Common bandstand, near where Sarah Everard was last seen, was cancelled, mourners have still visited and left flowers, including the Duchess of Cambridge, who was seen paying her respects earlier.Reclaim These Streets hopes that virtual gatherings and at-home vigils will have an even wider impact. It has joined forces with Feminists of London to host a virtual event from 6pm, live-streamed online to the Reclaim These Streets YouTube channel.The group is also calling on people across the UK to stand on their doorstep holding a candle or light on Saturday night at 9.30pm, the time when Everard is thought to have gone missing.A vigil planned in Edinburgh has also been switched to an online event, with organisers hosting a stream of online speakers and “doorstep vigil” activities.In Glasgow, organisers have decided to hold vigils in four locations : George Square, the Mary Barbour statue in Govan, Kelvingrove park and Queens park.In order to keep in line with current restrictions, they are asking women to tie ribbons or leave messages of solidarity throughout the day and volunteers will be present between 6pm and 8pm to collect them.In Belfast, Reclaim The Night are hosting an online vigil at 6pm to “remember Sarah and all victims of gender-based violence” and are asking those who cannot attend to light a candle at the same time.Here is the full story from my colleagues Molly Blackall and Libby Brooks."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoWe are at the dawn of a new industrial revolution\u0026rsquo, says Eamon RyanChange in Bord Bia programme will compel members with \u0026euro50m turnover to set goalsHow car batteries are made and charged revealed as problematic in US studies"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: \u0026lsquoWithin hours it had grown another 8cm or so, curving to tighten its grip\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 160,729 had received their second dose.Some 173,435 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 278,326 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 117,815 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp627 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 300 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19.

It also urged the British government to set the date for a Border poll.“With your support we can be the first generation of Americans to visit a free and united Ireland,” it stated in bold print.As Taoiseach Micheál Martin prepares to hold his first meeting, albeit virtually, on Wednesday with President Joe Biden to mark St Patrick’s Day, the ads were a reminder of the outsized influence Sinn Féin continues to exert in Irish-America.That influence has grown in recent years, as Brexit and the 20th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement has renewed focus on Irish-American affairs. For Sinn Féin and many Irish Republicans, the fallout from Brexit has thrown up a once-in-a-generation opportunity to push for a united Ireland.“Irish unity is the one thing that unites Irish America,” says Ciarán Quinn, Sinn Féin’s representative for North America. “Irish-America sees the changes that are happening in Ireland, and they believe that there is an opportunity here to achieve Irish unity through peaceful and democratic means, something that generations of Irish-Americans have worked towards.”The ads are the latest manifestation of a new engagement by Sinn Féin in America. They have also brought fresh scrutiny about the party’s fund-raising in the United States.The small print at the bottom of the ad states that it was paid by “Friends of Sinn Féin Inc, which is registered with the Department of Justice, Washington DC, under the Foreign Agents Registration Act as an agent of Sinn Féin.”US fundraisingFriends of Sinn Féin – the US fundraising arm of the party – is one of a handful of “Friends of Sinn Féin” groups scattered around the world, including in Canada. It is registered with the US department of justice and is required to file accounts each year. Latest filings showed that the organisation raised $295,000 (€262,000) in the six-month period to April last year – the vast majority of which came from its annual fundraising dinner in New York.Friends of Sinn Féin have declined to disclose the cost of the ads, which are thought to run to tens of thousands. In addition to the two half-page ads, they also ran full-page ads in the Irish Echo and the Irish Voice. The bulk of the funds for the ad campaign was generated by a recent online funding drive.The campaign is the latest effort by Sinn Féin to up its engagement with Irish-America ahead of next week’s St Patrick’s Day celebrations.Yesterday Sinn Féin representatives held a virtual briefing with members of the Massachusetts state legislators. A meeting with the bipartisan Friends of Ireland group of congress members on Capitol Hill is scheduled for next week.In recent days, Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, and Sinn Féin MP John Finucane, son of murdered Belfast solicitor John Finucane, briefed the ad-hoc committee on the Belfast Agreement. The group, which was established in 2019, includes more than two dozen prominent Irish-Americans, including former members of congress and ambassadors.According to people on the call, O’Neill made the point that Sinn Féin was now the largest party on the island of Ireland, and that Mary Lou McDonald, the first female leader of the Opposition, is likely to be the next taoiseach. The Sinn Féin briefing was one of several the committee has held with political groups and stakeholders involved in Northern Irish issues.Online presenceAs well as engagement with decision-makers in Washington, Sinn Féin’s US arm has also increased its online presence since the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Earlier this month, it hosted a conversation with former IRA leader Bik Mac Farlane, billed as “The Inside Story of the 1981 Hunger Strike”. Mark Guilfoyle, president of Friends of Ireland USA, said the group has beefed up its social media presence over the last year. “That’s really where we’ve seen the uptick in interest. When it comes to Irish unity in particular, the engagement is off the charts,” he told The .How to respond to the pervasive presence of Sinn Féin has been a consistent challenge for Irish governments. During the Troubles when the IRA-aligned NorAid was openly fundraising in Irish communities in America, Irish diplomats and officials skilfully worked behind the scenes to channel Irish-American concerns about Northern Ireland away from Republican violence and towards a peaceful solution.While times are now very different, successive Irish governments since the peace process have not always been on the same page as Sinn Féin. A measure of the continued allure of Sinn Féin, and Gerry Adams in particular, was in evidence at an event in October 2019 to honour Congressman Richard Neal.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced the event, which was organised by Irish-American Democrats. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe was also present as he was in town for the World Bank-IMF meetings. But it was the presence of Gerry Adams, who had flown to Washington for the event, that elicited the biggest cheer of the night as he was feted by most of the audience of Washington insiders.But senior US political figures dispute the idea that Irish-America is somehow in thrall to one political party, pointing to the work that goes on behind the scenes by the Irish Embassy in Washington, which has strong relationships with senior figures in Washington.‘Caricature’Bruce Morrison, the former congressman behind the Morrison visas, questions what he calls the “caricature” of Irish-America, and the notion that America is somehow orced from Irish political realities. Members of the Ad-Hoc Committee on the Good Friday Agreement, which he co-chairs, “have spent years learning, observing and being involved in issues in Ireland North and South,” he says. While they represent a spectrum of views, he says “all have always been concerned about the wellbeing of the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland”, adding: “These Americans are the reason there is a Good Friday agreement.”Congressman Neal, who co-chairs the Friends of Ireland group and chairs the Ways and Means Committee, which ultimately have a say over a US-UK trade deal, agrees. As a seasoned observer of Irish affairs – he was centrally involved in the US-brokered peace process during the Clinton administration – he says that he and colleagues in the caucus have always spoken to all sides in the Northern Ireland issue. “I was on first-name basis with leaders of all the political parties, and on the British and the Irish side. Everyone gets a full hearing.”Ireland’s Ambassador in Washington, Dan Mulhall, who is in constant contact with senior political figures in the US capital, similarly points to the fact that there has always been a range of views in Irish-America. “What has struck me is that everyone I have spoken to is strongly supportive of the Good Friday agreement. On the issues that matter, there is strong consensus across the board.”Like the Irish Embassy, the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington – which unlike the Welsh and Scottish bureaus is located in its own office rather than in the British embassy – also has strong relations with political figures in Washington.Both First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill are scheduled to attend their annual St Patrick’s Day breakfast, which is taking place virtually on Wednesday. A recent memorial service for their former director, Norman Houston – a hugely respected figure in DC – featured a tribute by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, an indication of the links between the bureau and the Biden administration.Key opportunityAs for President Biden himself, Irish officials in Washington see the Biden presidency as a key opportunity to advance Irish interests, given the president’s Irish-American heritage. The former vice-president has been a visitor at the Irish Ambassador’s residence in Washington, most recently in September 2018 when he launched the four-volume Cambridge History of Ireland.“He’s someone who has identified strongly as an Irish-American throughout his political career,” says Mulhall. “He was one of the founding members of the Congressional Friends of Ireland in 1981 and is deeply knowledgeable about Ireland, which is certainly a positive.” As Mulhall notes, Biden’s interest in Irish political affairs stretch back to his time in Congress. Recently unsealed state papers show that, as a senator, Biden proposed a resolution in 1990 calling for the Birmingham Six case to be reopened. He also urged then president George HW Bush to raise the issue with Margaret Thatcher.As for his views on the current situation in Northern Ireland, Biden warned Britain last year that any trade deal between the US and the UK “must be contingent upon respect” for the Belfast Agreement. His comments – which followed a similar warning from Pelosi – came at a delicate political moment in UK-EU relations.Now Biden is meeting Martin at a time when there is renewed concern about Britain’s commitment to the Northern Ireland protocol. The prospect of the White House weighing-in on Brexit is a concern in London. In particular, it is understood that Brexit negotiator David Frost was unnerved by the inclusion of his EU counterpart, Marco Sefcovic, in the Friends of Ireland briefing with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney on Wednesday.Biden is likely to be briefed ahead of Wednesday’s bilateral meeting by officials who have a long-standing interest in Irish issues. Jake Sullivan and deputy chief of staff Jen O’Malley Dillon have strong links with the Washington Ireland Program. Amanda Sloat, senior director of European Affairs at the NSC, studied in Belfast and is an expert on Brexit.Whether Biden uses his meeting next Wednesday with the Taoiseach to publicly comment on the latest Brexit developments on the Northern Irish Protocol remains to be seen.Dublin, London, Belfast and Brussels will be watching closely.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4509037.1615581196!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state no longer asks passengers if their travel is essential","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Róisín Shortall  says the Government should be trying to increase transparency and public access to data, ‘whether that is in relation to travel, vaccines or case numbers – not reduce it’. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe State has stopped collecting data on whether people are travelling into the State for an essential reason since early February, it has emerged, including seeking such information from those travelling from high-risk countries.According to figures collected for the first week in February, the last week when such information was sought from incoming passengers, 46.3 per cent of 12,659 people claimed they were travelling for essential reasons.Ms Shortall, the Social Democrats’ co-leader, said there was no apparent reason why passengers were no longer being asked to state whether they were travelling for essential reasons. “It seems to be a move which will only serve to obfuscate the facts on international travel. Why was this decision taken and are there any grounds for it?” she asked.She said the Government should “be making every effort to increase transparency and public access to data, whether that is in relation to travel, vaccines or case numbers – not reduce it”.Asked why the essential travel data was no longer gathered, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health said it was “removed from the form in February with the introduction of new regulations on mandatory quarantine”. Restrictions on arrivals from Brazil and South Africa were imposed on January 26th, but plans to introduce mandatory hotel quarantine quickly have so far stalled.Separate figures released to the Dublin North-West TD show that almost 10 per cent of people arriving into the State in February – after the Government announced its intention to clamp down on travel – are coming from or recently travelled through countries where “variants of concern” are prevalent, while new statistics show more than 4,000 people arrived from countries where there is heightened concern over coronavirus variants. Category two countriesIn all, 4,172 people arrived into the Republic from one of the 33 category two countries, or whose recent travel history included one. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is one of only two schedule two countries with direct links to Ireland, accounted for almost half of the arrivals, with 1,828. Some 1,465 people were associated with recent travel from Brazil, while 313 reported South Africa on their forms. Austria, the only European country on the list, accounted for 149 arrivals, with 96 linked to Argentina, and 321 passengers disclosed recent travel to another of the 28 countries on the list. The arrivals account for 8.6 per cent of passenger locator forms completed between February 8th and March 7th. The Department of Health has said it is in advanced discussions with an operator for the mandatory hotel quarantine service, but an anticipated announcement of the counterparty to the deal and when the service would begin did not materialise this week. Ms Shortall said the figures “underline how vulnerable we are to the importation of the virus from overseas”.“It goes to show the important role for mandatory hotel quarantine, which needs to be implemented very quickly and be applied to passengers from all countries if we are in any way serious about protecting our public from further spread of the virus and these variants.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4509819.1615624947!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"italy goes back into lockdown as covid 19 cases rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople crowd Piazza San Callisto, in Rome, Italy, as the region of Lazio enters lockdown due to soaring numbers of coronavirus infections. Photograph: Fabio FrustaciEPAMost of Italy, including its capital Rome and its financial centre Milan, will have curbs on business and movement intensified from Monday as the government ramps up its efforts to stem a steady rise in coronavirus cases.The country will also be placed under a nationwide lockdown over the Easter weekend for the second year running, the government said on Friday.Italy, the first Western country hit hard by the pandemic, saw infections rise by 10 per cent this week compared with the week before, and officials have warned that the situation is deteriorating as new, highly contagious variants gain ground.In recent months the country has calibrated restrictions in its 20 regions according to a four-tier, colour-coded system (white, yellow, orange and red) based on local infection levels which are revised every week.Under an order approved on Friday by health minister Roberto Speranza seven regions have been shifted into the toughest red zones, including Lombardy around Milan, and Lazio around Rome.Three other regions were already red, meaning half the country’s regions and most of its population will be under the most severe restrictions from Monday.In these areas schools and non-essential shops will be closed and Italians will only be allowed to leave their homes for work, health or emergency reasons.“I hope that this will be the last sacrifice asked of our citizens,” said Lombardy President Attilio Fontana. Italy has reported more than 100,000 deaths from the disease since discovering its first cases 13 months ago, the seventh highest toll worldwide.Friday saw another 380 deaths and almost 27,000 new cases.Easter clampdownThe whole country will become a red zone over Easter, from April 3rd-5th, Mario Draghi’s one-month old government ruled.It was not immediately clear how the new decree would affect churchgoers in the Catholic country. However, it was expected to be similar to provisions last Christmas when people were allowed to go to churches in their neighbourhoods.A Vatican source said Pope Francis’ Easter Eve Mass likely would be held a few hours earlier so that faithful could get home in time for Italy’s 10 pm curfew and that the pontiff’s Holy Week activities before Easter would be held in the Vatican with a limited number of participants.Unlike last year, Friday’s decree allows for limited visits to friends and relatives over the Easter holiday - for example to see elderly parents.Apart from Lazio and Lombardy, after the latest shifts in the colour-coded restrictions, the red regions will be Emilia Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Veneto and Piedmont in the north, Marche in the centre and Campania, Puglia and Molise in the south.All the other regions except the island of Sardinia will be orange, limiting movement between towns and restricting bars and restaurants to take-away service only.Sardinia, where infection rates are low, remains a white region with relatively modest curbs on daily life.As Italy tries to accelerate its anti-covid vaccination drive, Draghi said on Friday some 170,000 people per day are currently being inoculated and he aimed to “quickly” triple this number.These efforts got a boost later on Friday when the Italian medicines agency approved the use of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson’s single-dose vaccine, paving the way for the first shots to be delivered in a month.

Photograph: Martin BureauAFP via Getty ImagesThe World Health Organisation called on all countries to drop restrictions on the export of vaccines and vital components, as a rush for Covid-19 jabs puts pressure on global supply and a fresh wave of infections threatens Europe.Several countries around the world have imposed bans or restrictions on exports of doses and key vaccine ingredients amid a scramble for stock, causing logjams in complex international pharmaceutical supply chains that could slow progress to end the pandemic, the global health body warned.“Some countries have imposed legal restrictions on the export of critical supplies. This is putting lives at risk around the world. We call on all countries not to stockpile supplies that are needed urgently to ramp up production of vaccines,” WHO chief\u0026nbspTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press conference.“In a global pandemic no country can go it alone, we are all interdependent,” he added. “We cannot end the pandemic anywhere unless we end it everywhere.”US stockpileA ban on vaccine exports by the United States has led to 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine accumulating in an Ohio facility, and tens of millions more in a separate facility in Baltimore, the New York Times reported. The AstraZeneca vaccine is not yet approved for use in the United States, so cannot be used domestically.“We understand other governments may have reached out to the US government about donation of AstraZeneca doses, and we’ve asked the US government to give thoughtful consideration to these requests,” a spokesman for AstraZeneca said.The European Union is in talks with Washington in a bid to ease supply bottlenecks, a European Commission spokesman said on Friday, after US president Joe Biden said his country would only be prepared to share doses once his own population was served.The EU has exported a million doses to the US and more than 8 million to Britain since February, but has extended until June a requirement for permits for some vaccine exports that saw Italy block a shipment due to Australia last week.Glass vials, plastic components and raw materials used in vaccines are among the components in short supply due to the sudden surge in demand, according to the WHO.\u0026nbspPlanned vaccination campaigns across the EU have been hampered by steep cuts in expected deliveries from AstraZeneca, which is on course to supply only 30 million doses by the end of March rather than the more than 100 million that were initially expected.“I see efforts, but not ‘best efforts’,” European commissioner\u0026nbspThierry Breton wrote on social media, calling on the board of AstraZeneca “to exercise its fiduciary responsibility” to meet the company’s commitments.Third wavesThe shortfalls and uneven vaccination campaigns have piled public pressure on national governments across the bloc, amid concerns a third wave of infections is building in Germany and Italy, which is preparing a strict lockdown that will confine Italians to their homes for the Easter weekend to counter the surge in infections.There were concerns that the speed of vaccine rollout could be slowed as several European countries temporarily paused the use of two batches of AstraZeneca vaccines pending a review of reports of blood clots in patients.The WHO said there is no indication that vaccines caused such conditions, and that a certain number of cases would be expected when the jabs are given to so many people, because such conditions occur in the population.\u0026nbsp“More than 335 million doses have been administered globally so far, and no deaths have have been found to be caused by Covid-19 vaccines,” said Dr\u0026nbspAdhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief. “But at least 2.6 million people have been killed by the virus, and more will continue to die the longer it takes to distribute vaccines as rapidly and as equitably as possible.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4509821.1615646858!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit and covid to feature in st patrick s day biden martin talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Joe Biden will hold a virtual meeting on March 17th to mark St Patrick’s Day with  Taoiseach Micheál Martin.

Both will then engage with the inaugural class of Frederick Douglass Global Fellows, 20 American students from minority backgrounds who have been selected to visit Ireland later this year, following in Douglass’s footsteps 175 years ago.Mr Martin will meet with speaker Nancy Pelosi, and with members of the US Congress Friends of Ireland Caucus, who mark their 40th anniversary on St Patrick’s Day.The Taoiseach’s programme commences on Monday, 15 March with a policy address to the Washington DC-based Brookings Institution in which he will set out his thinking on managing relations on and off the island in the post-Brexit context.Other events include speaking at a public event hosted by the Congressional Friends of Ireland Caucus in association with the Pat \u0026amp John Hume Foundation, and the Embassy of Ireland commemorating John Hume and the pivotal role he played in garnering US support for the peace process.The Taoiseach will participate in all events from Government Buildings.Speaking in advance, Mr Martin said: “My visit is an opportunity to highlight how our mutually beneficial trade and investment relationship leaves both our economies well-positioned to bounce back quickly.“I look forward greatly to meeting President Biden, who has a very special connection with Ireland, and to bring him greetings from Ireland on this his first St Patrick’s Day in office as President. I will thank him personally for his unstinting support for Ireland over many years, including in recent times for his support in helping to secure a positive outcome in the Brexit negotiations, as we face into the task now of making those new arrangements work well.”Britain’s decision to postpone the implementation of a key part of the Brexit agreement is set to feature in discussions.Ahead of St Patrick’s Day, the US Senate is preparing to unveil a new resolution in support of the Belfast Agreement to the floor early next week.Commenting on London’s decision to extend the grace period for custom checks between Northern Ireland and Britain, US congressman Richard Neal said the move was “arbitrary and capricious”.“There seems to be a pattern that is developing in the aftermath of Brexit,” he said, referring to Britain’s unilateral decision to delay the introduction of checks by six months, in breach of the agreement.“It was the arbitrary nature of how the UK challenged what they had previously agreed to…the sort of camouflaging it by suggesting that it is only about a temporary postponement,” added Mr Neal, who chairs the powerful ways and means committee.Britain has argued that the move to delay the introduction of checks was needed to keep goods on shelves in Northern Ireland. However, the EU is now preparing legal action against the UK for breaking the terms of the Brexit agreement, which required the checks to be introduced by April 1st.Britain is dispatching an official from the Northern Ireland Office to Washington in a bid to counter Irish influence in the US capital as criticism grows at the highest levels in the US about Britain’s decision to breach the terms of the Brexit agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view how andrew cuomo went from covid hero to pariah","story":"Suzanne Lynch on the fall from grace of New York State governor Andrew Cuomo, whose early handling of the pandemic won him praise but is now subject to increasing scrutiny, and whose declining fortunes have been worsened by accusations of sexual harassment.The \u0027 unrivalled foreign affairs coverage, now brought to you in weekly podcast form.

When he isn’t prophesying eco-doom he can be found urging on the downfall of capitalism – which would, of course, bring about a not much better variety of doom. Yet even a radical Leftist like Monbiot can sometimes be onto something. This week’s stopped clock award goes to him because on Thursday he took to social media to show that he had been thinking about the EU a bit. As ever he was confused. But within the confusion lay something important.Monbiot started by saying that we must try to separate out the questions of whether Britain should be in the EU and whether the EU itself is a good thing. Rather bravely (given his tribe), he stated that he had come to the conclusion that the EU is not a good thing, indeed it is a bad thing. Rather illogically, perhaps because he wishes to retain his position as the Cassandra of the hard-Left, he never the less still managed to maintain that Britain should remain within it.Other than pausing to laugh for a moment, I do not want to get stuck on the inconsistencies of the eco-Left, but the first part of this breakthrough still struck me as significant. For Monbiot said that the realisation that the EU is not a good thing had come to him “gradually” and I wonder whether this isn’t something that a large number of people are feeling at the moment. Recent polls suggest so.The areas that Monbiot listed as contributing to his awakening included the EU’s environmental, agricultural and biofuels policies among others. These all happen to be among his personal hang-ups, but the conclusion he came to could have applied to the hang-ups any of us might have. He concluded: “The problem seems to be that governments can hide behind the European Council and European Commission.” And indeed, that is one of the arguments that Eurosceptics have made for decades. It may be that Monbiot is especially irate about the ability of governments to hide behind the European Commission to push through environmental policies they would be unable to defend at home. But the same critique has for years been applied from every other political direction in different policy areas.For example, over the course of decades people mainly on the Right have pointed out that governments hid behind the European infrastructure to avoid having sensible migration policies. They said that their hands were tied – that nothing could be done – because of decisions that had been made at the Brussels level.Similar critiques came on trade policy, tariffs and a whole range of other issues. The point is that few if any of these things could be addressed so long as a national government could claim – rightly or otherwise – that it was Brussels who had the power. The realisation that Brussels had a democratic deficit and that this in turn made national governments as well as the supranational government in Brussels unaccountable should never been a concern solely of the political Left or the political Right. It should have been seen all along as a pan-political problem.Mr Monbiot’s concerns are his usual ones, around the ability of corporate lobbyists and other to quietly push through policies at the EU level that they could not get away with at home. But everybody else could perfectly happily apply the same critique to whatever their particular bugbear is.For instance, if you are especially concerned about the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to get away with genocides, pandemics and much more, you might be concerned at the EU’s ability to be silent on Chinese atrocities while acting beseechingly towards it at a trade level. If you are concerned about Russia policy you may be dismayed at the EU saying one thing about Vladimir Putin while nodding through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline on the other. Closer to home, you might worry about the security of Northern Ireland, but you have to face an EU which simultaneously professes to worry about the issue and violates the sovereignty of the province without democratic recourse or accountability.These things and much more rankle with people depending on their own particular interests. But they are all related in the central issue of a dreadful lack of democratic accountability. A deficit which can be seen at any moment, on any issue.Over recent months, European publics have been treated to the sight of the EU’s vaccine development and procurement policies. It has been a test which the EU has failed appallingly. Franco-German protectionism delayed both the development and purchases of vaccines. Sheer incompetence at the Commission level exacerbated these and many other issues. And now we see an EU where the best-performing members in vaccine rollouts are those – notably Hungary – who have broken away from the EU scheme.People in Brussels should be held to account, but as ever they will not be. Ursula von der Leyen may preside over another tragic farce, but still there will be no alteration in the personnel and no accountability. Because that is how the EU rolls, and it is how it always will roll.Europhiles will say that all that is needed is reform at the EU level. But the people who say this cannot have spent any time studying the EU’s form. If the EU were capable of learning lessons it would learn them. But it hasn’t. It never does.What lessons has it learnt from Brexit – from losing one of the largest contributors to its budget? Nothing. Guy Verhofstadt and the rest of them have spent five years threatening Britain and insulting British voters. But not once have they bothered to wonder what it was that the British public saw that they did not like. Or whether the British public might have been onto something.For their part, the British public have noticed this and much more. One poll this week showed that only 39 per cent of the British public now have any interest in rejoining the EU. That is a decline of 8 per cent in the past few months alone. Perhaps the public can see what Monbiot and others are quietly conceding. Which is that, whatever the EU’s fate, it was never the great moral cause célèbre it was made out to be.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"seven 10 positive covid cases school children likely wrong","story":"Seven in 10 positive coronavirus tests in school children are likely to be wrong, experts have warned, as they called on the Government to bring back confirmatory PCR testing. Biostaticians are concerned that infections in the community are now so low, that false positives and negatives are vastly outnumbering true cases, leading to real cases being missed and families needlessly being asked to isolate.Pupils are currently being tested twice a week for coronavirus using lateral flow devices, but real-world data has shown they miss positive cases around 50 per cent of the time.Similarly, although they pick up 99.9 per cent of negative cases, meaning fewer than 0.1 per cent will be false positives, the prevalence rate is now low enough that false positives will be making a significant contribution to the overall figure.Previously, positive tests were confirmed using a more accurate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) lab test, but this week the Government admitted it had quietly scrapped the process at the end of January.It means that thousands of pupils and their families are having to isolate needlessly, and missing more school after months away from classrooms.Latest figures from NHS Test \u0026amp Trace show that in secondary schools there were 328 positive cases found in 663,332 tests between February 25 and March 5.It means that just one in 2,000 pupils are testing positive for the virus. Experts warn that is far lower than the 1 in 270 that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) believes to be the current community prevalence, suggesting large numbers of cases are being missed.In primary schools 613 positives found from 721,546 tests in primary schools giving an overall school prevalence rate of 0.067 per cent or roughly 1 in 1,500.With that prevalence rate, if a million tests were conducted 670 should come back positive.With current testing accuracy, half positive cases (335) would be missed and 1,000 would be false positives. It would mean that out of a total of 1,335 positives, just 25 per cent would be accurate.Professor Jon Deeks, a biostatistician from the University of Birmingham, said: “We would expect far more false positives than true positives amongst those testing positives in schools.“There are many uncertainties but given the DHSC data it seems likely that over 70 per cent of positive test results are false positives, potentially many more.  Addition of a confirmatory PCR would add little cost and would most likely reduce false positives to 1 in 1,000,000.    “The refusal to confirm lateral flow results with PCR is at best perplexing, will make testing less attractive, and create harm by wrongly isolating iniduals, families and other close contacts.”Last night, the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) wrote to the Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) warning of the ‘potential harm’ of failing to re-test children.The RSS warned that there could be ‘legal implications’ for curtailing the freedom of children, classmates and family members on such a flimsy scientific basis and asked for the MHRA to insist on a confirmatory PCR test.In a report to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) last year, Dr Carl Mayer and Dr Kate Baker, from the Government Office for Science, warned that Britain would face a problem with false positives once the infection rate became very low. “When only a small proportion of people being tested have the virus, the operational false positive rate becomes very important,” they wrote in their report.They warned that there was risk of overestimating the Covid-19 incidence, and the demand on test and trace.Profesor Carl Henegehan, director of the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine at Oxford University said: “This becomes a huge problem when you have low prevalence. We have been working for years to try and minimise this problem of false positives in mass testing programmes. “Once you’re doing the levels of testing we’re doing, you’re false positive threshold will exceed the test positivity threshold and so testing becomes of limited value.”This week, the Department of Health said the accuracy of lateral flow tests was 99.9 per cent and could be as high as 99.97 per cent. But even at the upper end, the chance of a test being correct with the current school prevalence rate would only be around 50 per cent.Prof Sheila Bird, formerly programme leader of the MRC Biostatistics Unit at University of Cambridge, said: “NHS Test \u0026amp Trace and Public Health England have attempted to justify not offering PCR during school-monitored use of lateral flow devices for asymptomatic screening of secondary pupils on their return to school in England. “More than 600 positives can be expected this week when over 1.5 million asymptomatic secondary pupils have been screened. “Half may be PCR-negative. By withholding data and denying PCR-confirmations, the half who are PCR-negative will never know – unless families and schools demand fairness for our children.”Independent Sage has voiced concerns that data from voluntary Covid testing for pupils may not reveal the full extent of transmission rates.  Sir David King, chair of the Independent Sage Committee, and the former government Chief Scientific Advisor, said: “We know Covid-19 is not simply going to vanish and I’m afraid without a fully functioning system in place we will once again be forced into using the blunt instrument of lockdowns in the future.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"amid wreckage snp last glimmer hope union","story":"Spring is not the only thing in the air as Scotland’s Tories prepare for their “virtual” conference this weekend. Although they have become used to being told repeatedly by pollsters that their prime concern – the maintenance of the UK – is under threat from a soaraway SNP, there are signs that things might be changing.The most significant of these is the quite astonishing malaise that is engulfing Nicola Sturgeon’s government and which now suggests that there’s much more than a glimmer of hope that the apparently relentless march towards another independence referendum and the break-up of Britain can be stopped in its tracks.The massive personal support Sturgeon had built up through her handling of the Covid pandemic – aided and abetted by daily televised appearances – seamlessly transferred to what looked like unassailable leads in public backing for her party’s chances of a huge victory in the May 6 Holyrood elections, and also in a second referendum.However, that backing may now be trickling away in a dramatic change of fortune, as voters increasingly look at her major domestic policy failures, the truly astonishing public battle she is fighting against her former mentor Alex Salmond, and an overwhelming feeling that all is far from well inside the Nat tent. And just as those who lived through them remember the sex and sleaze scandals that blighted John Major’s administration after 13 years of Tory rule, so after the SNP’s 14 years in power, La Sturgeon’s critics now claim her government has become “mired in sleaze”.The SNP has so dominated almost every aspect of national life since 2007 that Scotland has often taken on the appearance of a one-party state. One result of this unbroken “reign” has been that Sturgeon’s government, by concentrating exclusively on independence, has failed spectacularly to meet its policy commitments, such as improving education attainment for the poorest children or ending its appalling drug death record. Meanwhile, it has persisted with a “hate crime” bill, which critics say severely restricts free speech.Easily the most spectacular downside for the SNP has been the Sturgeon-Salmond battle, fought with scarcely an iota of regard for each other, in marathon televised evidence sessions. They concerned when she knew of allegations of sexual misconduct against him, which he denied, and what part she played in a botched inquiry into the claims and which saw him awarded over £500,000 in legal costs. He was subsequently acquitted of 13 charges of sexual assault in the High Court.Claims that Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code by misleading the Scottish Parliament are due to be adjudicated on shortly after an independent inquiry by an Irish barrister. Critics insist she should resign if found “guilty” but she says she will put it to a parliamentary vote.Another shock came this week when the SNP’s chief whip at Westminster stood down after a formal complaint alleged that he had touched a party worker inappropriately.Given the SNP’s troubles and the near disappearance of Labour, a great deal has been expected of the Tories north of the border, who have been the main opposition at Holyrood now for four years.But that was before the emergence of the perceived “double whammy” of Boris Johnson and Brexit, neither of which was reckoned to be of much appeal to Scots voters. And the Tories’ relative electoral success was achieved under their former leader, Ruth Davidson, who has decided to sample the red benches of the House of Lords instead of taking to the hustings once more. However, she remains a key asset alongside her successor Douglas Ross, who is planning to switch from being an MP at Westminster to becoming an MSP at Holyrood in the May elections.He has had a chequered relationship with the Prime Minister, resigning from his Government over the Dominic Cummings affair, and insisting that he – and not Boris – runs the Tory brand in Scotland. However, the two have apparently kissed and made up thanks to the runaway success of the PM’s vaccine programme, as well as the Chancellor’s estimated £20  billion largesse in helping to save jobs in Scotland and prop up its economy.We Scots are not exactly known for our expressions of gratitude, but there is little doubt that what is called “the Boris factor” over vaccines and Treasury loot is making a significant difference to voters’ perceptions. The message that an independent Scotland could not have afforded anything like the support organised from Downing Street seems to have got through. And as a member of the EU, which is what Ms Sturgeon wanted, Scotland’s vaccine rollout would have been as patchy as that in much of Europe.According to a senior Tory election strategist, the success of these policies has been “the tipping point” for many wavering Unionist voters who had been attracted to the SNP by the Sturgeon PR successes over Covid but were now returning to the fold. If he’s right, the battle to save the Union through “jabs and jobs” starts with the speeches from the PM and Chancellor tomorrow.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela merkels party set heavy defeat bellwether german regional","story":"Germany is set to get its first glimpse of life after Angela Merkel this weekend, and the signs are that it will not be comfortable viewing for her Christian Democrat party (CDU).Growing discontent over the country’s shambolic vaccine roll-out looks set to hit the party hard in key regional elections, and could leave the race to succeed Mrs Merkel as chancellor wide open.Two states are set to elect new regional governments on Sunday and the results will be seen as a bellwether for September’s general election, when Mrs Merkel will step down after 15 years as chancellor.Just a month ago, the CDU appeared to be on a triumphant procession to yet another term in power. It was far ahead of its rivals in the polls and Mrs Merkel, widely praised for her handling of the pandemic, looked set to hand the keys of the chancellery safely to Armin Laschet, the newly elected party leader.All that has unravelled in a matter of weeks, as it became clear Mrs Merkel’s decision to hand control of Germany’s vaccine orders to the European Union has left it lagging far behind the UK and US, with no prospect of catching up before summer.When she told Germans they had another two or three hard months ahead of them this week, it did little to improve the national mood.The CDU has seen its lead in the polls plummet by 6.5 points in just five weeks, and it looks set to suffer salutary defeats at the hands of its two main rivals this weekend.In the crucial southern state of Baden-Württemberg, a historic CDU stronghold, the Green Party has opened up a seemingly unassailable 10-point lead.The western state of Rhineland-Palatinate is closer, but most polls put the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD) two to three points ahead.There was an air of panic at Adenauer House, the CDU headquarters in Berlin, this week as the party realised it could be about to start a defining election year with two significant defeats.“This general election is wide open. Possibly more so than any previous election. Because the corona crisis is tearing up all political certainties,” Spiegel magazine said this week, before going on to enumerate the government blunders that have thrown it into disarray.“The vaccine was developed in Germany, but not enough doses were ordered. The coronavirus app protects data rather than people.The government reacted too late to the second wave, imposed a month-long half-shutdown without consequence or goal, did nothing to prevent the start of the third wave, ordered rapid tests too late and made unfulfillable promises of reopening.”Last week Spiegel said the only reason it was not calling for Mrs Merkel’s resignation was because “it would plunge Germany into a political crisis in the middle of the pandemic”.The CDU has yet to agree its candidate for chancellor in September. Mr Laschet should be a shoo-in but many in the party are having second thoughts.The trouble is there aren’t many alternatives. Jens Spahn, the health minister, is only just clinging onto his job. The only other contender, Markus Söder, isn’t even a party member — he’s the leader of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the CSU.To cap off a terrible month, the past week has seen three MPs from the CDU and CSU forced to resign over corruption allegations — two of them over accusations they took backhanders for brokering government contacts for facemasks.CDU grandees fear they are facing a repeat of the corruption scandal that brought down Helmut Kohl and ushered in seven years out of power — so much so all the party’s MPs were ordered to sign a declaration they have not taken any backhanders this week.It is against this backdrop that Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate will vote this Sunday. It is hard to overstate the importance of Baden-Württemberg.The home of Mercedes and Porsche, the state is an economic powerhouse. It is also one of the three big states that between them account for more than half of Germany’s population, and a traditional vote bank for the CDU.Sunday’s vote in the state will pit the CDU against its closest rival in September’s elections, the Green Party. The Greens have made dramatic advances in Germany in recent years and at one point appeared to have usurped the SPD as the second major party — and nowhere is as central to that success as Baden-Württemberg.The CDU ruled the state uninterrupted for 58 years until the Greens and the SPD joined forces to oust it in 2011. The ensuing coalition proved so popular the Greens won convincingly in 2016, and they look set to extend their lead on Sunday.The regional Green Party, and in particular its leader, Winfried Kretschmann, have blazed a trail for the idea the Greens can be a responsible party of government, and the party’s success in the state has served as a blueprint for its reinvention on the national stage.Under Mr Kretchsmann the Greens dropped many of their more hardline stances and adopted a pragmatic approach — recent years have seen Mr Kretschmann’s government defending the state’s car industry from attempts by more radical environmentalists to ban older cars from city centres.Meanwhile in the smaller Rhineland-Palatinate the SPD looks to be cementing a recent comeback in the national polls that has seen it neck-and-neck with the Greens.The party saw its vote share drop to a historic low in 2017’s national elections and has been struggling to recover while serving in coalition under Mrs Merkel.But the pandemic has allowed the party to differentiate itself from the CDU. Olaf Scholz, the finance minister and SPD candidate for chancellor in September, has won praise for his economic rescue programme and is widely considered to have had a good pandemic.All the signs are that Mrs Merkel\u0027s fateful decision to hand control of vaccine orders to Brussels may have left her fighting not only for her legacy, but also for her party\u0027s grip on power.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc proms accused embarrassed classical music heritage new job","story":"The BBC has been forced to deny it finds classical music “dull, embarrassing or only for old people” after sending out an advert for the Proms that referenced only house music, sci-fi film scores and breakdancing.The video, shared on the BBC Proms Twitter account as a job advert, opened with the words: “One thing about the Proms that people don’t know is that it’s not all just about classical music like Mozart and Beethoven.”It appealed for people without a background in classical music to apply.The video prompted an immediate backlash from within the classical community. Martin Fitzpatrick, head of music at English National Opera, compared it to the satirical BBC show W1A.“Come on, BBC Proms, what is this? A trailer for a new series of W1A? Classical music isn’t something to be embarrassed about. There is much about the Proms that is wonderful but you wouldn’t guess it from this advert,” Fitzpatrick tweeted.Aleksandra Myslek, a classically trained pianist and junior fellow at the Trinity Laban conservatoire, wrote: “Awful. Dear BBC, classical music is wonderful, inspiring, life saving, peace calling, educational, hypnotic, irreplaceable. Stop being embarrassed. Lots of young people share this view (while being well versed in other types of music).”Oliver Webber, professor at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, said: “Surely it’s possible to embrace variety and ersity without apologising for the core repertoire of the festival?”The advert is for two six-month placements, one as an event coordinator and another as an assistant publicist. It features a young BBC employee explaining: “The Proms showcases so many different music genres and styles, from House, Ibiza music, to sci-fi film music, to breakdancing music. So there really is something for everyone and you don’t necessarily have to have a background in classical music to work at the Proms.”She explains that she began her career at the Proms and progressed to a job working on the BBC Three show RuPaul’s Drag Race UK.Sarah Minns, the opera singer, wrote on Twitter: “This made me angry. It’s as if classical music is a dirty secret. BBC Proms, surround yourself with people who love the Proms for exactly what they were supposed to be. There are so many people passionate about classical music and not just wanting a step up at the BBC.”A second BBC employee in the video recalls that the “standout moment” of working on the Proms was dressing as an astronaut and jumping around on stage during a concert by Public Service Broadcasting, the indie rock band.Alan Davey, controller of Radio 3, defended the advert. Speaking at a conference for the Association of British Orchestras, Davey said: “This advert was about appealing to a wider range of people who might normally think about applying for jobs at the Proms. There are seasonal jobs there and every year we want to put a plea to as wide an audience as possible.“The advert is not saying classical music is dull, embarrassing or only for old people. What it says is that the BBC Proms is more than you think.“When we do things like the Ibiza evening, you get an audience who’ve never heard an orchestra before. Then they want to hear an orchestra again.”The Ibiza Prom took place in 2015 and was hosted by Pete Tong, the BBC DJ, featuring the Heritage Orchestra.Its inclusion in the season raised eyebrows, prompting Suzy Klein, the Radio 3 presenter, to attack the “self-elected snobs and scaremongers” who “want to ‘protect’ classical music, and high culture at large, from the onslaught of mass entertainment”.The Ibiza Prom became the most downloaded concert of the season.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"conservative russia balks tajik refugee raps way eurovision","story":"Nearly a decade after President Vladimir Putin embarked on a crusade to bolster conservative values, Russia has banked on an unlikely candidate to lead them into the Eurovision song contest: a Tajik refugee on a mission to smash female stereotypes.Manizha, a domestic abuse activist born in a peasant hut, has upset the establishment and delighted the country’s increasingly progressive youth as she rapped her way to victory with a song that lampooned traditional attitudes to women.Watching Eurovision may be treated as guilty pleasure in many parts of Europe but the kitschy song competition enjoys a cult status in Russia where getting the right artist and the right song for it is considered a matter of national pride as important as the performance of the national football squad in the World Cup.In recent years, Russia has chosen the safe option of typically vacuous bubblegum pop boy bands carrying simple love ballads without a political or social message.But Manizha, a sassy and candid 29-year-old, who grew up in Moscow after fleeing a civil war in her native Tajikistan in the early 1990s, says that her mission at Eurovision would be to present Russia as a “big, multicultural and strong country that gave me shelter.”In her Eurovision entry titled “Russian Woman” Manizha appears on stage wearing a traditional Russian sheepskin coat and a headscarf, singing wistfully about waiting for a distant male figure only to kick off the coat a moment later to appear in scarlet overalls, rapping in English: “Every Russian woman needs to know: You’re strong enough to bounce against the wall.”The idea behind the song, according to Manizha, was to show “what a stunning journey the Russian woman has made from a peasant’s hunt to having the right to vote and run for office, from the factory floor to space travel.”In a country where discrimination against Central Asian migrant workers is common, Manizha has been open about grappling with her own dual identity, singing in one of her songs about being “not quite a Slav, not quite a Tajik” and making fun of both the stereotypical Tajik and Russian woman.She has also lent her voice to activists fighting domestic violence and has been involved in local charities, helping refugees and migrants in the Russian capital where Tajiks are often considered one of the biggest but also one of the most marginalised minorities.The daughter of secular parents from predominantly Muslim Tajikistan, Manizha openly supports LGBT rights, which is largely a taboo subject on state-owned television.Her win in the national competition for Eurovision has delighted music critics and liberal intelligentsia but it also shed light on the ugliest forms of xenophobia and racism in Russia’s conservative circles.“The song’s lyrics is classic Russophobic abomination which is insulting for Russian women,” Yegor Kholmogorov, a well-known right-wing publicist, wrote earlier this week. “For the first time in a very long time millions of people in Russia will consciously wish for Russia to lose.”Russia’s best-selling tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda went as far as to run a piece by one of its columnists, known for uncomfortably close links to right-wing extremists, who suggested that Manizha has no right to represent Russia simply because she was born in Tajikistan.In the whirlwind of comment, the same newspaper on Wednesday ran a reconciatory piece headlined: “Is Manizha going to destroy Russia? Or have we all gone crazy?”Oksana Pushkina, the sole lawmaker in Russian parliament consistently pushing for women’s rights, earlier this week condemned several other lawmakers for dismissing Manizha’s song as distorting the image of the Russian woman.“My esteemed colleagues keep forgetting about the real and not imaginary problems: The law on preventing domestic violence still hasn’t been adopted, shelters for victims are few and the NGOs that are working on this problem are blacklisted by the government as foreign agents.”Younger Russians would probably have no recollections that two decades earlier their country was represented at Eurovision by faux lesbian duo t.A.T.u, and the Russian public did not even blink.But Vladimir Putin upon his return to presidency in 2012 after a stint as a prime minister heralded a new era of conservatism, promoting what he called traditional Russian values and attacking the LGBT community.The turn towards social conservatism, originally aimed at consolidating his support base, may have worked on older generations but Manizha’s win in a popular vote on state television came on the heels of recent sociological research pointing to a growing chasm between older Russians and the post-Soviet generation.Opinion polls show that Russians under 30 are more likely to support gender equality and be tolerant or supportive of the LGBT community. In politics, a similar ide is seen in terms of endorsement of President Putin as only half as many younger Russians are willing to vote for the incumbent president compared to people over 30.While older generations appear to be firm in their conservative views, younger Russians have become visibly more tolerant in recent years, especially on social media platforms, according to popular feminist blogger Zalina Marshenkulova.“The online landscape has changed dramatically: the feminist agenda has definetly won on Twitter. These days, you wouldn’t find a tweet with homophobic or misogyinist views that would get 1,000 likes,” she told the .The Kremlin’s propaganda of conservative values is not really working on a younger generation whose values are increasingly shaped by the internet, Ms Marshenkulova added.“There is nothing they can do with my generation of 30-year-olds in terms getting us to believe in those rotten and outdated values, and they totally can’t convince 20 year olds who grew up on the Internet, speak English and have a good idea what’s happening in the world, she said.In another sign of changing times, Russians’ perceptions of International Women’s Day have been changing radically in recent years.The holiday known in Russia as March 8 morphed by the final decades of the Soviet Union into a day-off when male citizens give flowers and chocolate to women and sing praise to their beauty and femininity.Russia, however, recently saw a noticeable pushback against the old notion of the holiday as women and men alike are trying to re-invent it as an occasion to talk about misogyny, equal rights and female empowerment.On Monday, many Russians including prominent opposition politicians, both male and female, took it to social media to write about gender equality under the hashtag translated as “March 8th is not about flowers.”Ms Marshenkulova, too, points to fewer misogynist ads and more conscious holiday messages on March 8 as a hint to a change in public mood but she believes that it mostly affects the educated classes and not larger swathes of society.Manizha’s win may not necessarily mean that Russia has defeated centuries of ingrained stereotypes about gender, family and sexuality but the fact that a singer like her has gained a platform on state TV shows that Russian society is evolving faster than the conservative politicians would notice.“These days, our country is being shaped by people like her - a woman born in the Central Asian who grew up in Moscow and who is fighting for her own rights as well as the rights of her friends in the LGBT community and women who face domestic violence,” Renat Davletgildeyev, a Russian journalist, wrote earlier this week in a column responding to xenophobic vitriol from the nationalist circles.“This is the future of Russia, dear racists.

The costumes totally informed the way I moved.”Recalling other Dalmations costume designs, she singles out the shoes worn by Cruella when audiences first see her: “When she steps out of the car, you see her foot sheathed in these challenging, high-heeled shoes.Literally, each heel is made out of a single nail. On a movie set, you… have to command your brain to not pay attention to the pain… You would never know, when you see me… that my feet were on fire.”Ms Close is among the industry’s most-nominated actresses never to have received an actual Oscar statuette. She is in good company. Peter O’Toole earned eight nominations without ever winning.Her best-known roles include Alex Forrest, the bunny-boiling lover of Michael Douglas in the chilling thriller Fatal Attraction, which was said to have made married men think twice about having an affair.But she lost out on the Oscar to Cher for Moonstruck. She says: “Designers, throughout my career, have been as important as directors, because I do not necessarily have an image of what a character should look like.I could never have shopped for Alex Forrest in Fatal Attraction… I would not know where to start. But what the designer, Ellen Mirojnick, brought to that role - the black leather coat, the seductive dress at the cocktail party, the white dress in the final fight - was an enormous inspiration.”In 2017, Close donated more than 800 costumes and other items to a major collection at Indiana University. Now a forthcoming book, The Art of the Character: Highlights from the Glenn Close Costume Collection, offers unprecedented insights into costumes that helped her create some of her most memorable roles.

At one stage someone can be heard asking: Are you OK there?Here\u0027s a take from reporter Izzy Lyons at Clapham Common.A police helicopter circled above the bandstand on Clapham Common yesterday evening, where hundreds of people came out to pay their respects for Ms Everard. Lily Stone, 26, from south east London, said: For all women in London, it could have be us. I walk home at night all the time. I do the longer, well-lit route. I’ve run home from friends homes. Sarah did everything right and it still happened. It’s scary.The Duchess’s unannounced appearance had echoes of those made by the Duke of Cambridge’s mother Diana, Princess of Wales, whose surprise visits, including to see Aids patients, were credited with changing public perception of difficult subjects, reports Senior Reporter Patrick Sawer.The Princess also made a surprise visit to Bosnian family in the small village of Dobrnja near Tuzla in 1997 to highlight the plight of landmine victims.Such surprise royal visits have also been used to signal support for those on the front line of Britain’s public services, such as the unannounced visit of Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital last June to meet NHS healthworkers on the pandemic front line and the Prince’s visits to MI5 headquarters in 2018 at a time of rising tension with Russia, following the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury.Labour MP for Streatham Bell Ribeiro-Addy tweeted: On today\u0027s walk, I laid flowers at Clapham Common bandstand in memory of Sarah Everard and all the women lost to violence.Hundreds of people came to show their solidarity and I can see hundreds more on my way home. The Police\u0027s decision to cancel the vigil makes no sense.The official vigil would have started now. Instead, people have been leaving their own private tributes throughout the day.Here is the latest from Buckingham Palace from our Senior Reporter Patrick Sawer.The Duchess of Cambridge paid her respects to Sarah Everard on Saturday, remembering “what it felt like to walk around London at night“, sources revealed.The Duchess paid a private visit to Clapham Common, close to the spot where the 33-year-old marketing executive was last seen alive on March 3.Sources close to the Palace said: “The Duchess wanted to pay her respects to Sarah and her family.“She remembers what it felt like to walk around London at night before she got married.”The visit came as thousands of women around the country have been sharing their own anxiety about being followed and attacked while out at night, in the wake of Ms Everard’s death.A vigil by Reclaim These Streets campaigners had been due to take place at Clapham Common before being banned by police and the Duchess’s visit is thought to have been carefully timed to avoid any large numbers who might have still turned out.Palace sources added: The timing wasn’t specifically planned – she did it privately.Here is the latest from our reporter at Clapham Common Eleanor Steafel.Kate.

This is a moment of reflection, but also one of action.On Friday, Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman suggested women should find another way to pay tribute to the 33-year-old, warning any vigil in a public place would go against coronavirus restrictions.Greater Manchester Police reminded people that congregating in large groups remained illegal due to current coronavirus restrictions but said it absolutely supports the doorstep vigils and encourages our communities to join them.Merseyside Police thanked organisers for postponing a vigil due to be held in Liverpool city centre on Saturday evening.In a tweet, the force said: We would like to thank the organisers of the Reclaim These Streets vigil for postponing their event until a time when it is safe and legal to do so without fear of attributing to potential spread of the coronavirus.West Midlands Police said events in Coventry and Birmingham had been cancelled after discussions with the organisers.Womens Safety Campaigners stand looking at the flowers and tributes for Miss Everard at the bandstand on Clapham Common where they were planning to stage a vigil tonightRead more from our  columnist...A crowdfunding campaign launched on Saturday morning by Reclaim These Streets has now passed £100,000 in donations. Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted her support: Reclaim These Streets has encouraged people to join a doorstep vigil instead at 9.30pm on Saturday at approximately the same time Sarah Everard was last seen alive. Several independent events have been planned around the country, mostly at 6pm. Some have already been cancelled and it is not yet clear how many will go ahead.A representative of Reclaim These Streets say they still plan to hold a virtual event earlier in the evening, at a time when it was dark in all parts of the country.In a statement posted on Twitter, the campaign group said it would be joining people across the country and shining a light - a candle, a torch, a phone - to remember Sarah Everard and all the women affected by and lost to violence.We continue to strongly encourage people not to attend any gatherings on Clapham Common this evening. Safety, both from Covid-19 and legal consequences, has always been our top priority for the women of south London.It added: We aren\u0027t just lighting a candle for the women we\u0027ve lost: we have been inspired by the women who have reached out and hope this is just the start of a movement that will light a fire for change.When Maria Lally and a friend were watched by a man as they swam, they didn’t think much more of it – but then the tragic case of Sarah Everard unfolded.Caitlin Prowle, one of the Reclaim These Streets organisers, said they did not want to end up in a situation they were having to raise funds to pay fines.She told the PA news agency: The police\u0027s lack of co-operation and unwillingness to engage with us to find a compromise means that we can\u0027t go forward in good faith.We can\u0027t put our supporters at risk, quite frankly we can\u0027t put ourselves at risk in that way, and so really they\u0027ve left us with no other option.She added: We are not willing to go to this amazing community and say we need you to help us with our hundreds of thousands of pounds in fines.She said the money will just go straight back into a system that continues to fail women.People are paying their respects at the bandstand in the middle of Clapham Common near to where Sarah wne missing.   Senior Conservative Caroline Nokes, the MP for Romsey and Southampton North who had previously said she asked Home Secretary Priti Patel to step in and allow the vigil to go ahead, said she hoped people would now take the advice of organisers to gather virtually instead.She told BBC Breakfast: It is important that women come together. We can do that virtually and recognise the ongoing issue there is with violence against women and girls, perpetrated by men, but do it in a Covid-safe way.Ms Nokes, who chairs the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, said she has told Government it must do something meaningful when it comes to tackling violence against women and girls.She said: The message I am giving back to Government is \u0027do something, do something meaningful, or my committee will be holding your feet to the fire over why not\u0027.I think that\u0027s the crucial thing. I want to see positive, determined action from the Government.Anna Birley, one of the organisers of the cancelled vigil on Clapham Common, said they did not want to be putting women at risk of fixed-penalty notices.She told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme this morning that sadly the vigil will not go ahead because we don\u0027t in good faith think that we can.In part because of the massive inidual risk that gives us as organisers and that we don\u0027t want to be putting women at risk of fixed-penalty notices.All the women across the country who are seeking to organise their own events too are at risk of criminal prosecutions from the Serious Crimes Act, which is what we\u0027ve been threatened with.Organisers released this earlier this morningThe serving politan Police officer accused of murdering Sarah Everard has been remanded in custody after his first court appearance.Police constable Wayne Couzens, 48, is charged with kidnapping and killing the 33-year-old marketing executive, who went missing while walking home from a friend\u0027s flat in south London on March 3.Her body was found hidden in an area of woodland in Ashford, Kent, on Wednesday. Couzens appeared at Westminster Magistrates\u0027 Court on Saturday morning for his first appearance following his arrest on Tuesday.Couzens arrived at the central London court at 10am in a large blue police van, stepping into the dock around 10:30am.Couzens spoke only to confirm his name and personal details, sitting between two plain clothes officers in the dock.  He wore a grey tracksuit and appeared to have a red wound on the top of his forehead.Artist\u0026#39s drawing of Wayne Couzens (middle) appearing at Westminster Magistrates CourtThe court heard the officer is accused of kidnapping Ms Everard in the Poynders Road area of Clapham.Ms Everard\u0027s body, found inside a builder\u0027s bag in Kent, was identified through the use of dental records, the court also heard. Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring remanded Couzens in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on March 16.On Friday, a High Court judge refused to intervene on behalf of the group in a legal challenge over the right to gather for a protest during coronavirus restrictions.People had vowed to attend the London event, despite the politan Police warning the public they should stay at home or find a lawful and safer way to express your views.Organisers said they had made many suggestions to police, including splitting the event into different time slots.But they said they were told that going ahead with a vigil could risk a £10,000 fine each for each woman organising, and that they thought meeting those costs would be a poor use of our and your money.They are now aiming to raise £320,000 - £10,000 for each of the 32 vigils which they said had been scheduled across the UK - for women\u0027s charitable causes.Tens of thousands of pounds had already been raised on Saturday morning.Sarah Everard\u0026#39s vigil was cancelled – but that didn\u0026#39t stop women paying their respectsComment: Even in the UK I don’t feel safe from the pernicious reach of the Chinese stateFarmers bitter at Tate \u0026amp Lyle sugars\u0026#39  Made in Britain packaging Exclusive: Uighurs harassed and abused by Beijing in UK, minister admitsWatch: Live footage from Sarah Everard tribute at Clapham CommonBBC Proms accused of being \u0026#39embarrassed\u0026#39 about its classical music heritage in new job advertCaptive wildcats sent to \u0026#39training camp\u0026#39 to equip them for life after release Former court martial judge \u0026#39could not convict despite believing rape accusers\u0026#39 The Weeknd joins top black artists hitting out at Grammys over snubPensioners to get third \u0026#39booster\u0026#39 jab in August, JCVI chief suggestsOld Etonian friend of David Cameron forced to scrap plan to build fancy seaside restaurant in DevonAu revoir to au pairs: middle class families told to hire someone who lost their job in pandemicComment: Unionists should leave the SNP to fall apart and concentrate on promoting BritishnessCoronavirus vaccine may help long Covid sufferers, patient groups and scientists suggestAs Britain’s Covid vaccinations gather pace, questions loom large over jabs for pregnant womenWilliam and Harry Act II: How they\u0026#39ve been shaped by the women they marriedThird jab for elderly would protect against winter waveIranian government orders teachers to identify children of persecuted Baha\u0026#39i minorityBiden\u0026#39s trans agenda met with growing backlash in US as Republican governors block reformsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"university feminist society disciplined excluding trans women","story":"A university feminist society has been disciplined for excluding trans women from talks and debates about rape and sexual assault.Women Talk Back hosted women-only meetings at Bristol University to discuss male violence against females, and argued the presence of men could make attendees fearful to speak out.The students refused entry to male-born transgender people who self-identify as women, classed as men under equality laws unless they have changed their legal sex.Now Bristol Students’ Union has ordered the society’s president, Raquel Rosario-Sanchez, to stand down and banned her from union leadership posts for two years.And committee members must complete an “equality, ersity and inclusion” course.The society\u0027s 73 members have written to Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, urging him to take action under new free speech powers to combat “unacceptable silencing and censoring” on campuses.A student filed a formal complaint against the society last year after a trans woman was shut out from a campus meeting on “women’s boundaries” in law, culture and society.Ms Rosario-Sanchez had cited the Equality Act 2010 which lists biological sex as a protected characteristic, meriting single-sex spaces.But students’ union officials ruled in February that the student was discriminated against and the incident was “extremely harmful” to them.The society was  told that Bristol SU defines women as all who self-define as women, including (if they wish) those with complex gender identities that include ‘woman’, and those who experience oppression as women.Ms Rosario-Sanchez, 30, a PhD student, said: “Women have a right to single-sex spaces when we are talking about sensitive matters. We want to use that law so any woman can have a space to talk and be respected and believed.“There is this climate where people think they have a right to censor and silence the free speech of others. It’s happening to us and so many students, but universities are becoming weaker and weaker.”Peter Daly, a discrimination lawyer at Slater and Gordon, warned sex and gender identity have been “conflated and confused”, with the latter not a protected characteristic under equality laws.“Institutions that misunderstand or misapply these concepts risk implementing policies that are at variance with the law,” he said.Two in five LGBT students have hidden their identity at university for fear of discrimination, according to the charity Stonewall. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"harry meghan prove royal story","story":"NewsopinionHarry and Meghan prove Royal story is childish fiction – but Brits dont want it to endThis is an infantilised nation obsessed with the Queen the same way Jacob Rees-Mogg is with his nanny.

YouTuber pranksters fed them a couple of snippets and off they went, dissing Meghan and defending the Palace, one saying “this was an actress giving one of her great performances, from start to finish”, despite not having seen that performance. But amid all the other outrage no one had time to be outraged. I wasn’t surprised, having worked alongside the late James Whitaker, who, whenever a royal story broke, would be inundated with media ­interview requests. They guessed he had nothing new to tell them, but didn’t care, so long as he said nothing in a posh voice. And he was so posh he drank vending machine coffee from a champagne flute. The Royal Family is a fiction, you see. For the majority of Britons it’s their favourite children’s book. A sort of Alice in Windsorland. And for those who hug its battered cover nostalgically to their bosom, it doesn’t have to be true, or real, just reassuring.As in all fiction this story throws up regular baddies – Wallis Simpson, James Hewitt, Paul Burrell and now Meghan Markle. But no royal is allowed to be seen as a baddy. Not eventhey ­associate with paedophiles. A mass grave could be found in Balmoral containing the corpses of babies murdered by a senior royal, who coughed to being an infant serial killer because he was bored with his ­pointless existence. And the majority of Brits would say “yes, but who’ll be head of statewe abolish them  Diane Abbott  No thanks”. The plot twists are a brilliant ­distraction from reality. Right now we’re hearing that post-Brexit trade with the EU is down by a third, low-paid workers who saw us through the pandemic face wage cuts, and the poorest schoolkids will fall a year behind in their education. But what’s that compared to wetting our knickers over a pair of spoiled rich kids pleading they’ve been left destitute in a Calornian mansion with only a multimillion pound inheritance and an in tray full of lucrative media deals to live on  Who cares about record use of foodbanks when they can listen to true patriots like Nigel Farage tell Americans there’s not a scintilla of racism at the top of the British state. That’s despite the current Prime Minister once writing that the Queen “has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies”.

It will allow hard-up parents to choose where they buy pupils’ kit instead of ­having to use monopoly suppliers tied to ­specic schools.The law, championed by Labour MP Mike Amesbury, follows a six-year campaign supported by the Sunday People.Parents currently cannot shop around because schools stipulate which stores must be used for the purchase of approved kit. Low-income families are forced to pay up to £ a year for a secondary school pupil and £ for primary school kids.

The EducationBill passed its final Commons stages on Friday in spite of calls by Conservative MPs for it to be delayed two years before coming into force. Mr Amesbury, MP for Weaver Vale in Cheshire, said: “This is a milestone. Parents, carers and children have waited far too long to be able to buy school ­unorms at a price they can afford. “Any further delay, particularly in the Covid economic crisis, would hit parents when they can least afford it. We want to see this implemented in time for the new school year. “I am absolutely pro-school unorms but the current policy fails young people who can face isolation and even exclusion through not being able to afford the right clothes. This law will put affordability centre-place.” The new law will apply to , schools with . million pupils in England. Manufacturers and shop owners want its introduction staggered over two years so existing stock can be sold.

But each nation in the United Kingdom has a dferent timescale - with phased plans based on dferent criteria. Here’s a round up of how lockdown rules will be relaxed in each part of the UK. Scotland  Scotlandaposs stay-at-home order is expected to be lted from April  under a phased plan to lt lockdown, with the country moving back to a levels system of restrictions from April .

Andthese results were repeated at a General Election the Tories would be ed with a  overall majority and  more MPs than Labour.Survation’s Carl Shoben said: “After perceived failures over PPE and test  trace the Government appears to be receiving a bounce related to the success of the vaccine rollout. “Labour has bet the house on challenging the Government’s competency on Covid. “The vaccine programme has left that strategy looking tired. Labour needs to focus on showing its dferent vision for the country.“ Sir Keir sought to exploit fury over the PM’s paltry one per cent pay offer to NHS staff tor the launch of his local election campaign last week. But Tory strategist Claire Pearsall said: “Kicking off a local campaign on a national issue is a mistake. “At local level people care about the three Ps - parking, planning and potholes.” Only  per cent of voters now think Sir Keir would make the best PM compared to Boris Johnson ’s  per cent while the PM’s favourability rating has gone up two points and the Labour leader down one.Four in ten voters approve of the Government’s performance, a rise of three points, but  per cent still give it the thumbs down. On May  there are  county councils up for grabs,  metropolitan boroughs,  unitary authorities,  district councils and  police commissioners because of postponed elections.On top of that London’s Sadiq Khan, Manchester’s Andy Burnham, Liverpool’s Steve Rotherham, West Midlands Andy Street and Bristol’s Marvin Rees are up for re-election in mayor ballots cancelled in March . ANALYSIS by Nigel Nelson Decency oozes out of Keir Starmer’s every pore. He’s also great company. And there is no doubt he would be a safer pair of hands than the butter-fingered Boris Johnson. But he is also naturally cautious at a time when the nation cries out for a bold and radical vision of a post-Covid future.  And Labour MPs privately complain that Starmer is yet to reveal the magic touch needed in a successful political leader - the ability to inspire. Tony Blair had it and won three General Elections.Jeremy Corbyn lost two but still drew adoring crowds wherever he went.Starmer’s job now is not just to talk about how he would make the lives of British people better. But to show them exactly how he would do it.

Royston Smith, the MP for Southampton Itchen, registered a claim to pay for car parking during a food bank visit in November last year, according to official records. The same month local media reported he had visited Southampton’s Kingsland Community Centre food bank. He later said he had thoroughly enjoyed the visit, saying he had been able to watch first-hand how the excellent volunteers are looking after those less fortunate. Labour ’s Andrew Gwynne said: “Food banks are one of the ultimate symbols of a decade of Tory failure.“But it takes a special sort of callousness to visit one then charge taxpayers for your parking. And Dr Alan Whitehead, the Labour MP for neighbouring Southampton Test, said: Whilst itaposs up to MPs what they claim for within the rules, car travel and parking around the constituency isnapost something I currently claim for. And doing so isnapost usually at the forefront of my mind after getting to see the great work that local foodbanks and charities are doing to support residents. Mr Smith told the Mirror: The visit was excellent, and I am very supportive of all those who are stepping up to help.I keep in regular contact with the volunteers and helpers in the constituency and I have nothing but admiration and gratitude for everything they are doing. Food banks in Southampton reported “unprecedented” demand in the run up to Christmas, as the Covid- led to more hardship than ever. In the South East alone, the Trussell Trust handed out , food parcels between April and September. Kingsland Community Centre, the ‘pop up’ food bank visited by Mr Smith said they had helped  families across four sessions in October. And as many as  new people were queuing up every time they opened their doors. A month before his visit, Mr Smith opposed a bid to force the Government to extend free school meals to be extended until Easter. He said a vote on the issue was a “politically motivated stunt.” On top of his £, salary as an MP, Mr Smith is paid £, a year for  hours work a month of consultancy services for Barker-Mill Estates, a property firm in Southampton. He spent £,. on expenses during the - financial year, including £,. on office running costs in -, £,. on staff wages and £,. on other office expenditures. He spent £,. of his accommodation budget of £,, and a further £,. on travel and subsistence. Yet his total claims were slightly below the national average for MPs expenses of £,. A former Southampton councillor, Mr Smith was elected to the Itchen constituency in . Kim Rose, his Ukip rival in that election, claimed Mr Smith had handed him an envelope marked “confidential” ahead of the election, which contained data to help him target Labour voters. Mr Smith denied passing on private details of voters - and Mr Rose’s claim that he had handed him a “racist leaflet” to use in the campaign. But he admitted giving him information on wards and votes at previous elections that was accessible to any candidate. Police investigated the claims, but no charges were brought. Mr Rose secured more than , votes in the  election, , more than Ukip got in . Mr Smith won by , votes. In , he held on to the seat by just  votes, making his the narrowest Tory marginal in the country.But in  he increased his majority to , after the Brexit Party stood down plans to stand against him.During the campaign, Mr Smith said he was “content” to hear Nigel Farage’s former party weren’t standing against him."},{"url":null,"title":"gp mum didnt enjoy single","story":"NewsGP mum didnt enjoy single day of pregnancy after suffering three miscarriagesEXCLUSIVE: GP Anita Raja worked on the NHS frontline until four days before her due date.

In August, Rumi was born after seven years of heartache and miscarriages. Having lost three babies, the pregnancy was especially agonising for Anita, who worked on the NHS frontline until four days before her due date, unsure whether she was putting her unborn baby in danger each time she walked into the surgery. With husband Nadir, a gastroenterologist, reassigned to work in intensive care during the pandemic, putting him face to face with Covid patients each day, the risk of exposure didn’t end when Anita came home. “Looking back, I don’t know how I did it,” says Anita, . “I lost lots of sleep over it and was very anxious. I didn’t enjoy a single day of the pregnancy because I felt so vulnerable.” Despite the risk, she felt obliged to keep turning up for work. “I had to do it for the NHS,” she says. “It’s not like other jobs – you can’t just walk away from your patients.” Anita was especially nervous as the impact of Covid- on unborn babies was unknown so the couple developed an elaborate routine to keep them all safe. “There was lots of news about NHS workers who were pregnant and lost their lives. It felt like World War Three,” she says. “When he came home from work my husband would go into the basement, take off his clothes, take a shower and keep his washing separate from ours. We were very aware of the risks of catching Covid. “The car steering wheel and gear stick needed to be wiped down after every use and we’d wear gloves when we were going shopping to prevent us catching it.” Anita had always known it might be tricky for her to conceive, after having a fibroid removed from her uterus aged  and being diagnosed with endometriosis at . Shortly after she got married in , she had her first miscarriage. “It was a missed miscarriage, so it was very early on and I never knew I was pregnant until it was over,” says Anita. Two years later she fell pregnant and in October , Nirvan was born. “I named him Nirvan because nirvana is a state of liberation and eternal bliss.”  But although Anita loved being a mum, she craved another baby. “I didn’t want my son to be an only child – I wanted him to have a friend, and someone to have after we’re gone, a family to leave behind,” she says. Anita and Nadir, who live in Birmingham, tried for two years to have another baby, but could not conceive. Then, in , they were thrilled to discover that Anita was pregnant. Sadly, at  weeks she miscarried. “I was devastated,” she says. “Although it wasn’t my fault, I felt a lot of guilt. “When you have a child and you want them to have a sibling, it’s dficult. “It’s so hard when they start asking for a baby brother or sister and you can’t give them one.” It was another two years before Anita became pregnant again. At  weeks, she had a scan to find out the baby’s gender but instead received the news there was no heartbeat. “While the sonographer was doing the ultrasound, she asked whether I’d had my  week scan,” she recalls. “I just knew it was going to be bad news.” “It’s a memory that will never leave me – it was so traumatic that I simply can’t get it out of my head.” Anita was devastated. “My world fell apart. My first thought was: ‘How am I going to tell my son ’ “He was waiting for a baby brother or sister, and now the baby wasn’t going to come.” Because she was  weeks pregnant, Anita had to give birth to the baby. “I was beside myself. I can’t tell you the pain I was in,” she says. After that crushing loss, Anita became depressed. “I was very unwell but I knew I had to pull myself together for my husband and son,” she says. “But the pain is always there somewhere.

Michael Rainsford, , was shot twice through the kitchen window of his family home in a revenge attack that targeted the wrong man.Two brothers, Michael and James Foy, were yesterday handed le sentences for murdering the young man, the Liverpool Echo reported.A poignant statement penned by Michaelaposs dad, Michael Rainsford senior, revealed in harrowing detail the anguish caused by the killing of the talented skateboarder. It was read to a courtroom sat in heartbroken silence before the judge, Justice Dove, said he had no doubt Michaelaposs death was a loss to the community. Mr Rainsfordaposs words, read by prosecutor Henry Riding, highlighted his sonaposs love for his mum and the steps taken to protect her from the agony of seeing the murder scene. This included leading her from the family home blindfolded so she did not have to witness the destruction caused by Michael and James Foy. Michael, like his siblings, was nicknamed a miracle baby by nurses after he was born despite fears health issues suffered by mum, Joanne, would leave her unable to give birth. His dad recalled his sonaposs smile that would light up a room and his caring nature, which attracted lelong friendships and developed further when he started to care for Mrs Rainsford as a teenager. Mr Rainsford wrote: My heart swells when I think of the love, care and devotion Michael showed to his mum. Shy in his early years, Michaelaposs le changed when he picked up a skateboard at the age of seven. His talent was a constant source of pride for his family. Mr Rainsfordaposs statement said: When Michael picked up a skateboard he changed his le.  Michael’s shyness and anxiety slowly ebbed away. Michael became confident and just kept improving his skill every time he went skateboarding. Our holidays were now geared around the skateboard parks all around the UK and any events or skateboard competitions. My shy little boy had grown with his ability and skills, Michael would always be the last person out of the skate park, such was his enthusiasm. I would watch my son on his skateboard and be so proud of how talented he had become. Other skaters would stop and watch him and bang their boards in appreciation of his skills. As he became older, Michaelaposs artistic talent came to the fore in his photography, his dad recalling: I always wondered what had caught his eye. Michael had an eye for capturing the beauty in landscapes, scenery, buildings and people.  But a letime of milestones and pride was ripped from the Rainsford family last year, when he was struck by two bullets fired through his kitchen window. The Foys were convicted of murder over the attack, with James today admitting he was the gunman - having denied involvement in the shooting and putting the victimaposs family through the agony of a trial. Mr Rainsford was with his son at the time. He detailed the horric scenes that followed: Time has stood still for me, my family and Michael’s friends since .pm on Tuesday, April  when evil visited our family home. I was standing right next to my son Michael in our family kitchen. In a split second our family le was broken and changed forever. I witnessed it. The night-time silence was broken by the violence of the two bullets ripping through our kitchen window in our family home and I witnessed my son being shot and murdered. The first bullet hit Michael, the second bullet also hit Michael as he tried to run past where I was standing. The second bullet was either meant for the moving Michael or possibly me as I was standing right where Michael was hit for the second time.  The last time Mrs Rainsford saw Michael alive was when he was being placed in an ambulance outside their Harrington Road home. While he was being taken to hospital, Mr Rainsford said: The last task Josh [Michaelaposs brother] and myself undertook was to guide Michael’s mum and sister down the stairs blindfolded. This was so they did not witness the trauma of seeing Michael’s blood on our family hall floor.The funeral took place at the height of the first coronavirus lockdown, forcing the family to grieve amid stringent restrictions that meant Michaelaposs le could not be celebrated in the manner he deserved.Yet his community still rallied in support, friends, neighbours, fellow skateboarders and Litherland High School teachers lining the route taken by the hearse and applauding in tribute. Of the ongoing impact of his sonaposs death, Mr Rainsford said: “Our family have an ongoing le full of fears, torments and regrets. And magical future family milestones that will never be archived… so many milestones have been stolen, ripped away from Michael in the cruellest, most violent way.  Whatever lay in our family’s collective future or over the horizon will never be ours as all our memories that were yet to be made have been destroyed forever by the senseless, barbaric murder of my son.” The final words read by Mr Riding came from Mrs Rainsford, who touchingly said: “My heart aches every single day for my son. I want him back. I do not understand why he was murdered and taken away from me. “We limp on as a forever broken family, bereft of the warmth, love, care and support Michael gave us, which is now forever gone.” The Foy brothers were found guilty of a murder described by prosecutors as an act of supposed retribution. Just under an hour before the shooting their home on Rossini Street, Seaforth, was bricked.

After speaking to Craig, Kerry and Leee, the -year-old, who lived in Shortferry Caravan Park in Fiskerton, Sheffield, was placed into a coma and died on March .Her daughter Kerry told Yorkshire Live : Sadly today we had to say goodbye to our beautul mum. The immediate family have been preparing for this overnight so had time to grieve privately.“This morning we had the call for her three children to go to the hospital. Unfortunately, her lungs were just too damaged and her body was giving up. “We spent a couple of hours with her telling her how amazing and strong she is. How much she is loved by all her family and friends. “She looked comfortable and beautul, full of colour and just like she was sleeping at home. “We need to focus on the  amazing years mum had, and all the happy times we all shared with her. Keep your family close and cherish every moment.” The devoted mum had been cautious throughout the year-long pandemic, making it harder for her devastated children to comprehend how the virus could take her so cruelly. Susan first started to struggle with her breathing and developed headaches but when she could no longer eat or drink Craig was advised to take her to Northern General Hospital.The -year-old said: “My mum has been so careful throughout the entire pandemic which is why it is so sad for her to get the virus at this point in the pandemic. “I think for many of our friends and family, we had not known of anybody who had become seriously ill through Covid until now, so this has really brought it home for everyone. “When we said goodbye, we were all trying to stay positive and told her it is what her body needs and how much we love her, but we were all devastated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"here 15 examples royal family","story":"NewsopinionHere are my  examples of where the Royal Family was racist as hellPrince William defended the royal family yesterday in an unprecedented outburst saying \"Were very much not a racist family\".

Centuries ago we elevated those humans who were good at war, and today their descendants still rule over us although we now handle the battles ourselves. Andthey want to stay on that blood-stained pedestal, they need to deserve it.  So when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said a member of the Royal Family inquired after their sonaposs skin colour, during debates about whether to give him a title or security, we wonderedthese higher-than-thous were pretty low. When Buckingham Palace didnapost comment for  hours, we became restless. And when a stf-backed Prince William declared we are very much not a racist family yesterday, there was relief he had deigned to mention it, although, to be fair, he didnapost really sell it.Which family was he talking about  His closest living relatives, the Windsors in general, or everyone going back to William the Conqueror, whose DNA is probably, by this point, distributed equally around the British Isles. The trouble with Williamaposs claim is that, whichever family heaposs talking about, there is racism. Quite a lot of it, in fact. And itaposs not out-of-context, reasonable-for-the-time racism. Itaposs eye-poppingly-bad-even-then-racism. Here are just a few examples.  . The time someone senior in Williamaposs immediate family repeatedly asked what colour his nephewaposs skin would be while discussing his security needs, and which he has yet to deny.. The time Prince William allegedly went to a party dressed as a gorilla, but couldnapost be clearly identied behind the mask, so pictures of Harry at the same party dressed as a Nazi caused a scandal instead.. The time his uncle Andrew left then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith slack-jawed at a dinner for the Saudi royals by making racist comments about Arabs that were unbelievable... it involved a comment about camels. . The time that same uncle referred to the n***** in the woodpile to one of David Cameronaposs advisers, who was of Sri Lankan descent.. The time his grannyaposs uncle said Adolf Hitler was not a bad chap and taught three princesses to throw a Nazi salute, in the same year the Reichstag burned down, Hitler had seized power, the Gestapo was created, Dachau was built, and thousands of Britons protested against rabid anti-Semitism and persecution of Jews.. The time that same grannyaposs uncle ignored government advice to visit Nazi Germany, dined with Goering, Goebbels and Hess, take tea with Hitler, and gave a speech saying that what he had seen is a miracle one can only begin to understand it when one realizes that behind it all is one man and one will. - . The time the Queen Mother told a diarist during a drunken lunch beware the Blackamoors, the time she told a journalist she “had some reservations about Jews,” and the time she told a lady-in-waiting that the Africans just don’t know how to govern themselves…what a pity we’re not still looking after them.. The time Princess Michael of Kent wore priceless jewellery depicting an African slave kept as a domestic pet to the wider familyaposs first meeting with Meghan Markle.. The time the same princess told black New Yorkers to go back to the colonies and named two black sheep on her farm Venus and Serena. . The time Queen Victoria became close friends with an Indian Muslim, and her son Edward VII sacked him within hours of her funeral, had him deported, then ordered every record of their relationship to be destroyed.. The time the Royal Family set up the Royal African Company, of which Edward Colston was merely a shareholder and employee, and shipped more African slaves across the Atlantic than anyone .. The time that wealthy slave-owner, banker and MP George Smith became enormously wealthy, his granddaughter married the Earl of Strathmore, and her granddaughter Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon married a prince, became Queen, and on her death left most of her £m estate and fine art to the Royal Family. . The time she also left about £m each to Princes William and Harry, who have, presumably, happily lived off the profits of slavery ever since.Some of these have roots deep in the mists of time. Others are bang-up-to-date. And itaposs worth pointing out that Britain ended the slave trade, too, and freed those brought to its shores by Americans who held on to the nasty habit for decades longer. In  Prince Charles condemned the atrocity of slavery. Prince William has spoken about the horrors of racism in football. Princess Michael of Kent, Prince Harry, even Prince Philip, have apologised for what have become known as gaffes.And at the end of last year, the Historic Royal Palaces announced a review of their buildingsapos and contentsapos links to slavery, which will probably see a lot of heavy annotation in souvenir handbooks rather than having to lose, er, pretty much every palace and private home.

It was just something for me because normally when you finish chemo you ring a bell and there was no bell at Stafford County Hospital because some people are on it for le so they wouldnapost have the opportunity to do it. “Doing this silly dance was my version of ringing the bell. I didn’t expect it would make people as happy as it has done. We had a lot of comments saying people felt really uplted by it, it’s been really nice.” The video has now had over , views. Lisa discovered she had breast cancer when she was initially diagnosed with tennis elbow last May. She then found a lump under her armpit. An MRI scan found cancer had spread from her breast to the lymph node under her arm. Lisa said: “I was on maternity at the time and that was all adding to my anxiety. “My cancer had got quite bizarre features so they werenapost sure how I was going to respond to the chemo at first but luckily the cancer in the breast has responded really well.I’ve done six months of chemotherapy every three weeks. I’ve got to have surgery to have the lymph nodes removed because there is still cancer in the lymph nodes so I will have those removed and have a mastectomy. “I’ve got to have the other breast removed as a preventative measure because of the high risk of it coming back and going to my oies. It’s a bit of a long road ahead.” Lisa has thanked her friends and family for their support, saying she could not have copedit hadnapost been for them. She added: “It’s been an absolute whirlwind of a year but I’ve been really lucky because my husband has been amazing and my mum as well. I’ve got some brilliant friends who have dragged me through kicking and screaming. “That support meant everything to me. I could not have got through the last six monthsI hadn’t had my immediate family, my support bubble and childcare bubble. “It was impossible to get out of bed some days let alone look after two small children and run a house and cook and do whatever . My support system is the only reason that I am here today in a good mental frame of mind.“Cancer and chemo infiltrates every layer of your le, it’s like a venom and it’s so dficult to try to hold onto yourself after the diagnoses and hold onto the person you were before. “Trying to keep hold of the positive mindset and do that is enabling me to carry on this journey. I have such a long road ahead but I am taking it one stage at a time. “I think a message I would give to people who are worried about their health and havenapost had a diagnosis isyou know there is something wrong go and get it checked out, that’s what the GPs are there for.” Lisa is scheduled to have a mastectomy next month.

The mum-of-one has shared her top tips on how she saves the huge sum on food every year by scouring Marks and Spencer for yellow sticker items. Kay So, , who lives in London but is originally from the US, was blown away by British food standards when she moved to the UK. In her home country, discounted items translate to damaged or defective products were packing has been dented or broken, and she claims the produce is sometimes even mouldy. Comparatively, the mum says that she was stunned to find heavily discounted food in near perfect condition in Britain – and she now uses a special yellow sticker system to save thousands of pounds on her weekly shop. What do you make of this method  Let us know in the comments section “I was always looking for ways to save and this practice of buying yellow-stickers on perfectly good items was a perfect fit,” Kay, a project manager, said. “It was pure joy to discover that yellow sticker discounts are common practice even in the most elite posh UK grocery stores, like MS and Waitrose. “I purposefully shop at MS for yellow sticker deals because their food is of the highest quality and tends to be way more expensive than other high-street brands like Tesco, Morrisonaposs, or Sainsburyaposs. “Finding and buying a yellow sticker item at MS is even more special because of this. “Itaposs five-star fine-dining on a budget. With Covid- lockdown limiting our choices to hit or miss takeaway, why even bother paying full price for posh groceries to get a five-star foodie experience at-home ”  Kay spends between £ and £ a week on food weekly, which covers all of the meals she, partner Roy , and daughter KP, eight, will consume during that time. She said: “I can get top quality groceries discounted for -% off retail price – especially with posh meats, fresh fish, produce and other food items that can be easily frozen for future use. “I would spend £ a week before but at a lower quality grade grocery store like Tesco or Sainsburyaposs.  “I save about over £+ quid a year buying MS groceries at discount . “In addition, yellow stickers are always a fun surprise. “You never know what you are going to get as a yellow-sticker deal that day you shop.  “It opens your eyes to dferent food and meals to try out or plan throughout the week, solely because the food is discounted.” Some of her greatest bargains to date include a Pork Crackling Leg Joint: Before , Halibut Filletand Frites . Kay recommends shopping at set times during the week when supermarkets often begin slashing prices.  She said: “It depends on the MS location. “The Oxford Street MS Food hall is a goldmine on Saturday afternoons and Monday mornings. “While the Greenwich location is prime for yellow deals at .pm on weekdays.  “Sometimes youaposll see MS employees going yellow sticker shopping themselves or putting items aside for their own shop too.” Since becoming a savvy shopper eight years ago, Kay has even encouraged her husband and family members to get involved. She said: My friends and family love it – especially in the US where this is totally unheard of.  “Often, my husband and I will grab separate trolleys and grab as many yellow sticker items as we can. “At the end of our shop, we compare our finds and see who got the best deals. It becomes a mini supermarket sweep for us.” Kay has been placing the money she saves on her weekly shop into an ISA account.

Nichola Ferron said she knew she wanted to settle in Neath in South Wales, where her partner is from, as far back as  when she first visited with him and was taken aback by its beauty. The -year-old chef grew up in Jamaica before being sent to live with her aunt in New York at the age of . Then, in , Nichola moved to London, where she found a job in banking.But when Nichola made the move to the unassuming Welsh town in summer , she said she found herself the most unhappy she had ever been, reports Wales Online.Nichola said: I didnapost really know I was black until I moved to Neath. Since I have moved here, I have experienced % more racism than when I lived in America or London. I experience racism in one form or another most days. Nicholaaposs first impressions, from visiting the area, were that it seemed a lot friendlier than London and she thought it would be a perfect place to raise her daughter. In , the family made the move and Nichola started her award-winning cake school business Cake Academy Wales, formerly in Angel Street in Neath town centre. But that was when the dream turned into a nightmare. One of the most shocking examples  was a racist letter sent to her cake shop with an abusive joke in. She added: I thoughtmy daughter could read she would be very angry and worried about herself. She shouldnapost have to grow up worrying about the colour of her skin.  My husband gave me something I never had before, he gave me security and happiness and let me do what I loved so I wanted to give something back to his community and then this happened. Nichola reported the incident to South Wales Police. A spokeswoman for the force said officers investigated reports of racially aggravated malicious communications at the time, adding: A suspect was identied and spoken to re his behaviour and referred to partner agencies for support. Nichola added: One of the first incidents I documented was when a man told me to aposeff off back to where I came fromapos in front of my shop. That was in January, . People had even been overtly racist to her in front of her daughter, who is now seven-years-old. Recalling one instance, she said: I was in my garden one day and saw someone throw dog poo in a bush [nearby] and I asked hershe would mind putting it in the bin as my daughter likes to play over there and I got from her aposgo back to where you came fromapos. Nichola said the person then went on a rant and started swearing at her, leading to an argument in front of Ocean. I apologised to my daughter because she hadnapost seen me angry like that before. I said to [the woman], aposexcuse me, youaposve just taught my daughter her very first lesson of racismapos. Ocean was also pulled out of school by her family because of racism she endured from other children. Nichola remembered how children told her daughter she could not be Cinderella because she was mixed race and did not have blonde hair with blue eyes. Despite everything, Nichola does not believe she should have to move because others are racist.

After one of the most tumultuous weeks of recent royal history, the Queen showed it was business as usual following the fallout from the Oprah Winfrey interview with her grandson Harry and his we Meghan.In a video call with scientists, teachers and schoolchildren to mark British Science Week, the monarch spoke of the importance of technology in keeping people together as well as protecting us from coronavirus.The Queen showed events of the last week - where her family was accused of racism and abandoning Meghan while she was pregnant -  had not knocked her off her stride by cracking a joke when reminiscing about the time she met Yuri Gagarin, the first human to travel out into space. Asked by top British scientist Dr Aderin-Pocock: “Yuri Gagarin, the first human to travel out into space was also born on th March, and I believe ma’am that you met him - What was he like ” What is your view  Have your say in the comments section Her Majesty drew huge laughs from her virtual crowd when she abruptly replied: “Russian!”. The Queen quickly added: “He didn’t speak English. But no no, he was fascinating. “And I suppose, being the first one, it was particularly fascinating.” Prince William on Thursday became the first royal to tackle head on allegations of racism within his family, after his brother claimed a senior royal had questioned how “dark” his further children with Meghan may be, told reporters during a school visit: “We’re very much not a racist family.” The Queen has said they will privately deal with the raft of accusations by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex about their unhappiness during their time in The Firm and is expected to call Harry personally in the coming weeks. In her discussion with teachers and schoolchildren to mark British Science Week, to celebrate the role played in UK society by science, technology, engineering and maths , has highlighted probably the most essential fact when planning a trip into outer space - the importance of ing home. Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a scientist and co-presenter on the BBC’s The Sky At Night programme, said of Gagarin: “It must have been very terrying to be the first one, and not really knowing what was going to happen.”  The Queen quipped: “Well, yes - andyou could come back again. That’s very important.” The -year-old monarch added: “This past year has really driven home the importance of science and technology in all of our lives, from the search for the vaccine, the rollout to the public, to the technology that enables all of us in dferent locations across the UK to gather and speak. STEM is very much a part of our lives.”  During the showcase, Her Majesty was also shown the latest updates from NASA’s Mars Perseverance mission, commenting how Red Planet looked “very rock strewn”.

Reclaim These Streets decided to raise the cash for womenaposs charities on Saturday morning after they announced their planned event in Clapham, south London, near where the -year-old disappeared, had to be axed following police objections. Instead they will switch to an online event where everyone is urged to stand on their doorstep with a candle. Grace Jessup, one of the eventaposs organisers, told the Mirror she was delighted by the generosity shown. She said: This movement has been born out of collective grief for Sarah. This is just not just about fundraising itaposs about changing peopleaposs minds and making them realise itaposs not easy for women. We think the level of donations really affirms the importance of the issue surrounding womenaposs safety and we are so grateful for everyone who has come out to support us, Sarah and other women who donapost feel safe walking home. We are hoping this marks a change. Reclaim These Streets had organised the vigil in memory of the marketing executive whose body was found in Kent and to highlight the dangeraposs women face in their everyday le.  However when their bid to overturn a police decision to ban it failed in court and after they were unable to persuade the Met Police to let the vigil go ahead they were force to cancel it. Grace said Reclaim These Streets are now urging everyone to stand on their doorstep with a candle at .pm instead. We want all women and everyone  to come together in memory of Sarah, she said. Some female MPs called on authorities to ensure women could safely protest in Sarahaposs memory and questioned the Governmentaposs proposed Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which campaigners fear will stle peaceful protest.  Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who represents Streatham in south-east London, tweeted: The police decision to shut down tonightaposs vigil  refuse to constructively engage with @ReclaimTS is deeply wrong. Women should not face arrest for showing solidarity. On Monday, the Govt will put down a Bill to further restrict the right to protest. Liberal Democrats deputy leader Daisy Cooper tweeted: It is the Govtaposs responsibility to ensure people can protest safely. Women around the UK wanted to stand in silence, m apart, w masks.

"},{"url":null,"title":"remembering mum how one mothers","story":"AdvertorialRemembering mum: how one mothers final wishes helped her daughter cope with griefMany bereaved families are preparing for a dficult first milestone after losing their loved onemirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAR AdvertorialClaire keeps a special photo on her phone of her as a child with her parentsLosing a parent is often one of the most dficult things people have to deal with in le. Along with many practical considerations, the emotional toll it takes can be overwhelming, creating a sense of grief that can be painful to confront. “Your parents are the people who knew you first, they know your history, they know all the stories about you,” says Claire Hewson. “They love you unconditionally. “When they’re gone, when that’s gone, and they’re not around, it’s a struggle.” Coping can depend on many things. The support you have from those around you, and the plans already laid in place. “I was lucky. My mother was a fantastic organiser,” says Claire, , a call centre manager from London. “She organised her funeral with the local Co-op Funeralcare – her coffin, the car she wanted, and even the flowers she wanted. “All I had to do was the music. Everything  was arranged and paid for. I will always be grateful to my mum for doing that. I wouldn’t have known what to choose.” Coping with loss The last couple of years have been ‘challenging and horrible’ for Claire, who lost her father, Bob, to cancer in May , and her mum, Eileen, who died suddenly in June , whilst in hospital being treated for an ongoing liver issue. “It just felt like the rug had been pulled from underneath me. No-one tells you about death or what it feels like to lose someone. There’s still a stigma when it comes to talking about it.” And yet, while she lost them both within a short period, her experience with each was quite dferent. “Dad was in a hospice so we were going in every day, and the nurses were amazing, telling us what to look out for,” says Claire. “Every day we went in, not knowing ‘will it be today’ ” Claire was still coming to terms with losing her father when her mum died.  “It was dferent dealing with each death. With dad, it’s like I knew he was gone, I saw his body. Mum’s death was sudden, so I never got to say goodbye, and that really does mess with your brain, there’s no finality. Planning ahead The fact that her mum had sorted out her funeral was a blessing. “When my mum’s sister died it was traumatic for everyone trying to arrange the funeral and sort the money out. Mum saw this unfolding and didn’t want that for me. “She said she didn’t want me to have to worry about anything with her funeral. She went to Co-op Funeralcare and had a chat and chose what she wanted. She said they were very pleasant, and it was easy to do. “I will always be grateful to mum for that because I wasn’t in my right mind and I’d urge anybody to do that. It makes that part so much easier for those left behind. All I had to do was phone them up and give them her details and that was it.

Since the -year-old marketing executive went missing on March , while walking home from a friendaposs house in Clapham, south London, women have been sharing their experiences of harassment and abuse. And thousands have taken to social media to share ways that victims can safely access help and support. One way is a secret hand signal, originally developed at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic by the Canadian Womenaposs Foundation, which said social isolation made it more dficult for those who are at risk of abuse or violence to reach out. The hand gesture provides a way for a person to silently show they are in distress and would like someone to check in with them in a safe way.  The hand is held up with the palm facing the camera, before the thumb is tucked into the palm and the fingers close over the top. It can be used on video calls, as a way of asking for help without leaving a digital trace. It could also be useful to women when answering a door,they donapost want to attract any attention. The hand signal and its meaning has gained new prominence after the country followed the shocking story of Ms Everard.  Sadly, police confirmed on Friday that human remains found during a search of woodland in Kent were identied as Sarah. Police officer Wayne Couzens, , was charged with kidnap and murder hours later. Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave acknowledged the public outrage around the case and the discussion about violence against women and personal safety. Speaking outside Scotland Yard headquarters on Friday, he said: “I know that the public feel hurt and angry about what has happened, and those are sentiments that I share personally. I also recognise the wider concerns that are being raised quite rightly about the safety of women in public spaces in London and also where in the country. Other code words and phrases have also been shared, in the hope they will help women in dficult situations.  In January, pharmacies announced they were launching a codeword scheme for domestic abuse victims. Men, women and children can now ‘Ask for Ani’at the counter, so that a trained member of staff will know to take them discreetly to one side and find outthey need help. It will be available initially in all , Boots stores across the UK, as well as  independent pharmacies. Reports suggest more than a hundred businesses including Superdrug and Morrisons have also joined in. iPhone users also shared a little-known tip - an Emergency SOS setting - that can alert the emergency services alongside your own contactsyou are in danger. It means you donapost need to unlock your phone, instead, you can simply tap the lock button five times. Search aposEmergency SOSapos on your phone or scroll through apossettingsapos to find it. There is a similar feature on Android phones, but how they work ies between manufacturers. Find out more about the emergency iPhone features here.

As I’ve argued before, we must keep the monarchy, but the Royal Family should change every week and be chosen by a National Lottery. With my system, instead of awkward battles and secret arguments, Nicholas Witchell would come on the  o’clock news to say: “Queen Eileen has issued a strongly worded statement, saying, ‘Prince Terry was out of order – it weren’t his place to remove security from our Kevin but you can’t tell him. He’s always been the bleedin’ same, the muppet.’” And that would be the end of it. Because all their dficulties come from the fact that the royals have no idea about normal le. In her interview, Meghan Markle said she couldn’t follow the strict palace rules, but no one normal could understand them. To the Palace, it makes sense that, “If one is a Duchess in the third drawing room, and the second son to the reigning monarch should enter, one’s valet must place a porcupine within one’s corset, and cry, ‘May I humbly prickle within, your highness and custodian of the holy ginger beer.’” But the lottery method would make the royals accessible. One week, an old family from East London would be royal, so the National Anthem would be a pub singalong, and go, “It’s a giggle being Queen, Though the palace needs a clean, And I’ve chucked out all the corgis ’cos I don’t know where they’ve been.”  The next week, a -year-old from South London would be king, so the anthem would be a rap that went: “God save the king, for I ain’t seen anyting’, like them crown jewels, dat is massive bling, big up myself, ’cos I is ruler of the Commonwealth.” The monarch is head of the Church of England, so the church would be the religion of that week’s lottery winner.  Some weeks it would be a Christian, but the next week it might be a pagan who lives in a wigwam in Devon. So that week, vicars across England would have to change their name to something like Spirit of the Wind, who would say: “Now let us chant our first hymn, number , Um Oo Oo Aaa, bring me peace and a box of chickpeas.”  Instead of shooting parties, each week at Sandringham there would be a Call of Duty computer game party. Servants would prepare the grounds, saying: “The controls are ready Your Highness.” Every time the Prince of Wales blew up a zombie, the gamekeeper would say: “Excellent shot, sir, shall I digitally bag your kill for you ” Under my system, none of the Royal Family’s current problems would have happened.

Rather than flagging down a member of staff or writing a strongly-worded letter to the supermarket, they instead decided to handle it with a good old-fashioned passive aggressive note. The cans of paprika crisps, which are shaped perfectly to create a convincing duck mouth, came with a price tag of £, leaving one shopper fuming in the knowledge you can often pick them up for half the price. Using a blank tag just under the display of Pringles, they wrote:  quid - youaposre having a bleedinapos laugh ainapost yer! and simply carrying on with their day. It was spotted by a fellow customer and a picture was shared to Reddit with the caption: The proper British response to Pringles being raised to £ in Sainsburyaposs. People left comments with their own theories, as one said: Pringles must be one of those things that no one ever buys on full price, just like those fancy Naked or Innocent juice drinks outside of meal deals.

The woman said she began filming after noticing the piece of aposwoodapos had opened its eyes. The clip then shows the bird becoming more wary as she approaches. Feathers on its back appear to stand up on end. But itaposs only when the bird opens its gigantic mouth that you see how truly bizarre it looks. Itaposs at this point that the woman jumps back in shock. The bird is actually a great potoo, a nocturnal species which preys on large insects and small vertebrates. Its most well known characteristic is the growling, moaning cry it makes throughout the night. The great potoo is usually found in a forest habitat in South America.  In this case, the woman filmed it sitting on top of a fence post at a farm in Chibolo, Colombia.According to the Mail, the woman said: The first time I saw him I thought it was a stick but he moved and I approached him.The bird opened its eyes and mouth and scared me a lot but being so strange I decided to take pictures and record videos. When I got closer I raised my hand, and he opened his mouth in reply.

It found that the pandemic has increased the value of cleanliness and hygiene for homebuyers with dirt, clutter and bad smells now collectively knocking almost £, off a property’s value. Three in five prospective buyers,  per cent, say they’d put in a lower offera property wasn’t clean when they viewed it, and more than  per cent say they wouldn’t even arrange a viewing for a propertyit looked unclean in photos.

Hopefully I can stay there now.“It was a bit of a strange time as obviously I thought I was going out on loan.“My confidence had fallen and I wasn’t playing as well as I should have been.I wasn’t hitting the standards I set myself.“I was just wanting games and there were a few teams interested in me, including Thistle.“I just wanted to play and get back to where I should have been which I feel I have ed to now. I am feeling good and I just want to keep it going.“I just worked hard in training and ended up getting back in the squad at Morton.“Football is mad sometimes how it works.”McDaid admits the delay in restarting Leagues One and Two worked out well for him and he hopes to continue his good form against Arbroath today at Dens Park.He said: “It worked out well for me.“If it had been a short time before they restarted, I would have been away. Instead, I stayed here training.“The date was pushed back and I continued training with Dundee and eventually got myself back in the squad. I still have another year at the club so I always wanted to stay.“I just wanted to get games but when I started training better, I regained a bit of confidence and I was training really well.“I started thinking: ‘Maybe I can stay and help the team here instead of having to go where#.“Maybe I just had a dip in form # nothing really changed # but it has obviously turned for me and I am doing what I am capable of.”McDaid had a successful time under current Partick boss Ian McCall while at Ayr United, winning League One and reaching the Premiership play-offs.However, the winger says there has been no contact from his former boss over the cancelled loan move.“No, as he understands that I am a Dundee player and I will be here next year,” said McDaid.“Obviously I want to stay here and play # which I am doing now # rather than go out.”Now back in contention for a starting spot at Dundee, McDaid is keen to help the side pick up points in a “massive week” for their season.He has good memories of facing today’s opponents Arbroath at Dens last season from grabbing both goals in a - win in October .He’d like to repeat that feat but also has an eye on Tuesday’s clash with Ayr and a trip to Alloa coming on Friday night.McDaid added: “It is a massive week for the club.“We got a point at Morton with a much better second half and then I came in against Inverness and we picked up a good win.“Saturdaywasn’t a great game from both teams but in the second half we played really well and had enough chances to win the game.“We are playing well so we have to try to get maximum points out of these gameswe can.”On his double against the Red Lichties last season, he added: “That’s always in the back of my mind when we play Arbroath.“Even when I was at Ayr, we won a few times against them.“So hopefully I can do the same today, win the game and get three points.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – The revenge of Tutties Neuk as Arbroath head for Dundee and how good is Benjamin Siegrist \" title\"#PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – The revenge of Tutties Neuk as Arbroath head for Dundee and how good is Benjamin Siegrist # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street--dundee-fc-arbroath-dundee-united embed # secretEfCTDySbd\" data-secret\"EfCTDySbd\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/HEALTH-Coronavirus-09074353_38161852-e1615311800566-300x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/HEALTH-Coronavirus-09074353_38161852-e1615311800566-620x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/HEALTH-Coronavirus-09074353_38161852-e1615311800566-940x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/HEALTH-Coronavirus-09074353_38161852-e1615311800566-300x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"home school survey parents give us their verdict on remote learning","story":"Home learning will be over today for most children, with all primary school pupils back in class from Monday.

It is incredible.“They seem to get there an awful lot and to get there again is brilliant.“I am really pleased for the fans, the owners and everybody connected to the club.“I will be supporting them with my Dundee United tracksuit on. I hope they get a positive result, I really do.“There are still a lot of my players there and I know Keith Hill the manager and all the staff he has got there.“They were all my staff. I know everybody from the chef to the groundsman.“Most of them were there when I was a player and some I played with.“They are a unique club and people just seem to work for them and show great loyalty to the club. I hope they go and do it.”If the relative size of each club in a final had anything to do with the result, Sunderland would stroll Sunday’s match.Mellon accepts that.But the United boss doesn’t believe there will be much between the teams on the pitch, despite a huge resource gap.“When you see the Stadium of Light and their fan base then Sunderland are massive,” he said.“I would say though when I was at Tranmere we didn’t half have our days in the sunshine against Sunderland.“We always gave them tough games but they are a massive club with a great tradition. They are right up there with the biggest clubs, in terms of fan base and grounds, etc.“It will be a good game and I don’t think there will be much between the teams.

sufferers to be prioritised for the Covid vaccine.Aberdeen-based Asthma and Allergy Foundation#s chief executive, Martina Chukwuma-Ezike, who is an asthma sufferer herself, hopes the government will allow all people who live with the lung condition to receive a Covid vaccination earlier.The Scottish Government bases vaccine priority on advice from the JCVI . Currently, only people aged - with underlying health conditions # including chronic respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cystic fibrosis and severe asthma # are prioritised.Martina argues that a condition such as asthma cannot be measured and someone#s mild asthma one day can be severe the following day.She said: #The government categories people with asthma and it shouldn#t be the case.#They are saying only people with severe asthma # people who have been in the hospital in the past  months and those on very high doses of steroid tablets # should be eligible to be prioritised.#As a charity, we think this is very wrong because asthma can never be quantied as a condition.#Someone who has very mild symptoms today can wake up with an asthma attack tomorrow # so how can you define #severe# #That#s why we#re calling on the government to vaccinate all asthmatics as a priority # we#re all at risk.#Martina says that since all asthma suffers were asked to shield during the pandemic, they should also all be prioritised and vaccinated early.She said: #People lost their jobs because they were shielding.#And now that there is a vaccine for them to have and they would be able to go out, get some fresh air and do the things they love, they cannot.#As a charity, we#re trying to echo asthma sufferers# voices.#The outcry has been huge, our phones have been busy and our pages have been filled with messages # people are desperate for help.#Martina said she has been very careful during the ongoing pandemic and has been #following all the advice and doing all the right things#.She said: #I#m very anxious # I thought that since I#m struggling to breathe, I should be able to get the support that I need and I#m not getting it.#I don#t know where  I should go for help.#Martina also thinks that since the government encourages every asthma sufferer to get a flu jab every winter, they should also enable all of them to have the Covid vaccination ASAP.According to the current advice published on the NHS website, %C%including%emphysema%and%bronchitis\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener noreferrer\"the flu vaccine is offered free on the NHS to anyone with a serious long-term health condition, including respiratory conditions, such as asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , including emphysema and bronchitis.The severity of asthma # apart from needing a steroid inhaler or tablets # isn#t specied.Martina said: #The Scottish Government encourages asthmatics to get the flu jab.#Why do they say asthmatics need to take the flu vaccine because they#re at risk but the Covid vaccine isn#t for them #It just doesn#t make sense.#There are medical reports saying people with asthma are more likely to be critical when they have Covid and they can even die from it.#Health Secretary Jeane Freeman commented on the issue during yesterday#s coronavirus update.She said: #As an asthma sufferer myself, I understand very well some of the anxieties that fellow sufferers have around this.#But, as a health secretary, it#s my job to pay really close attention to what clinical experts and vaccination experts tell me, which is where the JCVI advice comes from, but also, the advice in addition to that from our clinical advisors # people like Jason , like DCMOdoctors Dr Steedman and Dr Caesar.#So I understand the anxieties, but it is right that as a politician I don#t override clinical advice.#What I do know is that our clinicians and JCVI are constantly looking at the data and the evidence and other evidence that comes out the way that it is presented to them # not only from the vaccination companies themselves, but other data that comes forward to review whether or not they believe at any point that they should change their guidance or amend it in any way.#Restrictions easing this week mean people are now able to gather in larger groups when meeting outdoors in Scotland.Up to four adults from two households will be able to meet outside after new rules came into force across mainland Scotland and some islands.Previously, two adults from two households were able to meet outdoors.Further changes now in force include allowing people aged  to  to meet in groups of up to four from up to four households.Outdoor, non-contact sports for adults in groups of up to  are able to restart.Some areas in Scotland: Orkney, Shetland, Skye and much of the Inner Hebrides, remain under Level  restrictions.There, up to six adults from two households, and six people aged - from six households, can meet outdoors.Ms Freeman said: “All of these changes are focussed on enhancing people’s wellbeing and together they represent gradual but important steps towards greater normality.”Ms Freeman also confirmed that a national minute’s silence will be held on March , the anniversary of lockdown.The latest figures show  deaths from coronavirus and  positive tests were recorded in the past  hours.It brings the death toll under this measure – of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous  days – to ,.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland’s progress in vaccinations, falling coronavirus cases and a reduction in deaths and hospital admissions from the virus, had enabled the “modest…but important” changes.Ms Sturgeon said: “They will, I hope, help people’s health and wellbeing, by enabling group exercise, and allowing for a bit more social interaction.“They will also, I hope, let children see more of their friends, and exercise and play a bit more normally.”She also warned of the need for caution in easing lockdown to avoid the virus running out of control.Further changes are planned for Scotland on Monday as more pupilsto school.All pupils will be back in primary schools full-time, with theof P-P with in-class learning restarting for more secondary school students.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.54730106-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.54730106-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.54730106-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.54730106-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"aberdeen couple to appear on bbc game show the wall","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remA couple from Aberdeen is set to appear on BBC One#s The Wall this weekend.Sam and Louise, who have been together for  years and married for five, put their knowledge to the test after taking part in the popular game show, with their episode due to air tonight.Hosted by EastEnders star Danny Dyer, the show is the ultimate game of strategy, knowledge and luck.Sam and Louise were required to take on three rounds that test their general knowledge and trust in each other.Sam, a practice manager for a local optician, is originally from India but has been living in Scotland for  years.

In contrast, roads in other parts of Scotland have detailed works planned and money set aside to pay for them. After  years of failed attempts at a solution and six months after a major landslide, Argyll deserves better than a vague election promise to #enhance# the road.The only new ferries mentioned are two -metre ferries. These are the same two ferries that were promised in the  infrastructure plan, but still lie in a yard, years late and well over budget. Neither of these ferries is for Argyll and Bute. All we get is vague promises of a #long term plan and investment programme#.This so-called plan is a shocking neglect of Argyll and Bute.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,The start of  is proving to be an acutely challenging time for people with cancer, the NHS and for cancer care. Indeed, it’s clear that this is the most worrying time in recent history to get a cancer diagnosis.At Macmillan, people are calling our support line every day to tell us about the heightened anxiety, loneliness and distress that they are feeling.On our support line – open seven days a week on     – specially trained nurses, counsellors and financial support advisors are available to help anyone affected by, or worried about, cancer. They can provide comprehensive information and advice, as well as emotional support, to help people with cancer cope with the additional strain of the coronavirus pandemic.We know doctors and nurses are working in unspeakably dficult conditions and are having to make tough decisions every day. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to keep cancer care on track, but we also know that some treatment – operations, for example – are being cancelled or postponed because essential services such as ITU are full of seriously ill people with Covid-.What is absolutely vital is thatthere are changes to treatment plans, these must involve the person living with cancer and be communicated clearly.Although some changes may be needed for treatment plans, this is not the case everywhere or for all treatments or tests. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to make hospitals a safe environment so it’s really important that people with cancer who have been invited for tests or treatment do attend.GPs are openyou are worried about possible cancer symptoms, and screening and other vital tests have resumed in a Covid-safe way. The NHS is still here for you.As well as our support line, comprehensive cancer information and support is also available on www.macmillan.org.uk and our online community is there to provide invaluable emotional and peer support.Gordon McLean, strategic partnership manager in Scotland for Macmillan Cancer SupportSir,Inclusion Scotland, the leading Scottish disabled people’s organisation, believes that planning for the post Covid- Scotland must be about building towards a more inclusive future for disabled people, not back to an old #normal# that excluded a lot of us.As we launch our manesto for the  Scottish Parliament elections, disabled people have told us about the problems they face daily, both before and as a result of Covid-, and what needs to change.Before Covid-, disabled people were already some of the most marginalised and excluded in society.We were more likely to live in poverty, be unemployed or earn less than non-disabled people, and less likely to leave school with qualications, because of the barriers and exclusion we face in our day-to-day lives.The Covid- crisis and responses to it highlighted this, aggravating existing inequalities and generating new ones, and putting the human rights of disabled people at further risk.Going back to the way things were before is not the answer. We don’t want to go back. We want to go forward to a more inclusive future.The manesto # Rights and Renewal # sets out what disabled people told Inclusion Scotland are the most important issues they face and what needs to be done to make a post-pandemic Scotland a better place for disabled people. It has five key asks:I call on all political parties fighting the Scottish Parliament elections and their candidates to pledge their support for disabled people’s Five Asks.Dr Sally Witcher, Inclusion Scotland chief executive officerSir,Our dilapidated roads continue to be raised as an issue by many constituents.While I understand that our roads department is struggling due to local authority budgets being cut, much more still needs to be done.It has been said to me time and time again that we are fast approaching the point of noand when it comes to our roads and that neglecting day-to-day maintenance will end up costing us more in the long run.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case. All the SNP MSPs on the committee, however, voted against its publication, meaning it will not be released.The Scottish public deserves to know the truth of what happened and why £, of public money had to be paid to Salmond.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,The personal testimony of the men and boys in the final independent report into non-recent sexual abuse in Scottish football # who have shown incredible courage # demonstrates how needed this independent review has been.The abuse young players have suffered in football is inexcusable and heart-breaking. By bravely speaking up, they provided the catalyst for the review and the changes that will come from it are thanks to them.We welcome the ongoing work the Scottish Football Associationhas carried out in light of the report’s recommendations and encourage them to continue their progress.The SFA is showing it is willing to listen and implement changes that ensure no more children suffer the experiences described in the report.We are pleased to see children and young people’s involvement in the process, including the consultation with the Scottish Children’s Parliament. The voices of children and young people are crucial to developing improvements for their own wellbeing and safety and to change a culture where children can be frightened to speak up.Safeguarding in Sport, a partnership between Children st and sportscotland, has developed the Standards for Child Wellbeing and Protection in Sport, which state children have a right to express their views and have their voice taken into account. We are keen to support the SFA in its continued implementation of the recommendations to create a culture in football where we can be sure that every child is safe to enjoy the huge benefits of participating in sport.Any volunteer or official looking for advice or support about a child can contact safeguardinginsport@childrenst.org.uk or contact the Children st Parentline service on   or online at www.childrenst.org.uk parentline.Mary Glasgow, chief executive, Children st.Sir,Zero Waste Scotland’s Energy Efficiency Business Support Service provides free, independent advice to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprisesto introduce more energy efficient technology.Businesses can apply for an interest-free Scottish Government SME loan of £, to £,, with a maximum cashback grant of £, for those eligible.Many businesses in Argyll and Bute have decided to take action to reduce their energy use, adding profit directly to the bottom line while helping Scotland meet its target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by .Since , the impartial advice given to companies in the region has identied almost £m of potential energy savings through heating, lighting and building upgrades.To find out more or to apply, visit www.energy.zerowastescotland.org.uk.

Well done to everyone involved for getting the project to this stage.A broken record we might be, but we make no apology for it.As we have said before, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland have never taken seriously, really seriously, the issue of the Rest and wider Argyll connectivity. If they had, we wouldn#t be talking about it today.Yes, a lot of work has gone into mitigation. But that is all it has ever been # mitigation and nothing like a solution. And a constant drain on public money.We need new, fresh thinking on keeping Argyll connected. Perhaps the new business campaign group, with enterprising people involved, will pursue this notion as they apply pressure for action.In the past, this newspaper has mooted the idea of a competition involving young, forward-thinking engineers free from the baggage of history.Perhaps now is the time."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor february 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks.

Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin.

I wish Jimmy a really happy retirement, and would like to thank him for all he has done over the years.I went back to work at MAKI Pups, the new outdoor nursery based in Lochgilphead, last week but I intend to continue with my litter-picking at weekends when I can. I won#t stop now I#ve started.If anyone wishes to help in any way, please phone me on  .There was an interesting letter from Ron Wilson in the February  edition of the Courier which, as with any politician#s pronouncements, was laced with spin, hyperbole or half truths and consequently tells only half the story.Regarding vaccines, nobody, except the SNP, talks about Westminster#s charity. It is my understanding that Great Britain and Northern Ireland are part of the UK and independently opted not to use the EU system and purchased vaccines for itself.This elicited the usual howls of derision by SNP politicians along the lines of: #This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic and will cost lives,# and others of a similar vein.The inept EU vaccine-purchasing system has been and still is chaotic. France, at the time of writing, with a population of  million, has vaccinated . million. Pro rata, under the EU system, Scotland would probably have received , as opposed to the . million currently vaccinated.The electorate keep hearing: #As an independent member of the EU#. This is possibly an SNP aspiration but I think there are several hurdles to an independent Scotland joining the EU.What currency would be used, what proposals are there to meet the EU fiscal rules for membership in respect of the annual GDP deficit which is currently running at . per cent, well above the three per cent required The last figures available for government debt to GDP of  per cent is well above the  per cent required. Then there is the strong possibility of a Spanish veto or perhaps they are proposing throwing Clara Ponsatí to the wolves and saying: #We are sorry we backed the Catalans in order to curry favour with Madrid.#Regarding the EU solidarity stimulus plan, I would hope that it was considerably greater than the UK there are  member countries. I understand that it is € billion, spread over three years, and the grants and loans are subject to strict requirements. I notice that you do not mention £. billion to date allocated through the Barnett formula which is separate from the money. I do not know how much, currently paid to Kate Forbes MSP, cabinet secretary for finance#s department in the furlough scheme.Regarding the comments relating to Brexiteers and leaving the EU as #Johnson#s folly#, it has obviously escaped Mr Wilson#s notice that leaving the EU, liking the decision or not, was a democratic one by the UK electorate and, unlike the EU or the SNP, in our constitution we do not send the electorate back to vote again until such time that they #vote correctly#.Banking crash  May I remind Mr Wilson that it was the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland which were the main protagonists in the UK which had a serious impact on our economy. Mr Wilson#s rather emotive #gimcrack imperial fantasies# could well have applied to the antics of the two Scottish banks# boards of directors.I am not particularly an avid supporter of politicians per se but the current SNP government by any yardstick is a really appalling administration with a record of declining education, health care and financial mismanagement, just to mention three areas.Leaving aside the first two, what should cause concern is the eye-watering amounts of taxpayers# money wasted. The new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh is at least £ million over budget and still not fully operative Ferguson Shipyard ferry project, currently £ million and no ferries, projected final cost an additional £ million and no firm delivery date other assorted projects like the BiFab yards, £ million, two of which have been bought by a UK company for £, Prestwick Airport, there is a bit of #smoke and mirrors# but somewhere around £ million is close.A bit closer to home, the Glen Croe problem up to the Rest and Be Thankful, which has been ongoing since  and is regularly subject to closure, has had at least £ million spent on it to date. It is of no surprise that Jim McColl said that #everything the SNP touch is a mess#. Added to that, we have the current internecine Salmond Sturgeon Murrell case ongoing currently swallowed up in excess of £, of taxpayers# money and rising.Mr Wilson is perfectly entitled to his point of view, as I am to mine, but as I said in my opening paragraph, and this applies to politicians of all political persuasions, please present the full narrative not some unsubstantiated wish list.The neglect of the A is a disgrace. It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago, we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said it would solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.  We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions."},{"url":null,"title":"postponed new year competition played in brutal conditions","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth.#Timothy was to be a model of the Lord Jesus, the most loving man who ever lived and yet the one who disagrees with everyone. Disagrees  Really  Yes, Jesus# first word to the world in the gospel of Matthew is, #repent#, that is, #you are heading the wrong way, turn from sin to God.#Jesus isn’t addressing a particular section of society, or a particular behaviour, he is not directing his gaze at #everyone except me#. This is the most loving call in the world to everyone everywhere.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns colin joins team scotland staff","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

If we want children and families to come to the area we need to keep the school open,# he said.Argyll and Bute Council met yesterdaywhen members were asked to agree to hold informal pre-consultation meetings with representatives from  communities that may be affected by the school estate review.The council was also asked to agree to review the school estate #on an ongoing basis# and reducing the future scale of any changes which would be considered at any one time.Now the proposal is for Rhunahaorine to go into Glenbarr and Clachan and Skipness to go to Tarbert. Saint Kieran#s also goes into Castlehill in Campbeltown this is a paper exercise as Saint Kieran#s no longer has pupils and is mothballed.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGONew Post OfficeCampbeltown’s Meadows scheme is to get its own post office in the early summer.Post Office Counters plans to open a community post office in Ralston Road in late May or early June.Post Office Counters has already secured premises for the office which will be open for around  hours a week but the chairwoman of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancy Smith, said she would prefer a new post office in the town centre.Since the main post office moved from Longrow to the Co-op supermarket last summer, the town centre has not had a post office.Mrs Smith said: #I#m pleased that there is going to be another outlet for people, but unless people have got a car it#s only going to be suitable for people in the Meadows scheme.#She added: #The community council has always pushed for a post office in the centre of the town. Not only because it#s convenient, but also to help the commercial centre of the town.#FIFTY YEARS AGOLocal choir on radioCampbeltown Gaelic choir was taped at a concert in the Town Hall on Tuesday evening.The choir will be heard on BBC radio later this month.BBC men recorded a half-hour programme of all-Gaelic songs, which were introduced by Mr Hector McNeill.The choir was conducted by Mr Charles Bonar.

This is in contradiction to what is surely the council#s main aim when setting the budget # saving money where possible.Despite many of KRL#s staff having barriers to working, they do an exemplary job and are happy in their workplace # something which is evident from a visit to the recycling centre. The fact that some of them may lose the jobs they enjoy and do so well as a result of this decision is shocking and heart-breaking.Campbeltown has seen record levels of redundancies over the last couple of years, with more than  lay-offs at CS Wind and Campbeltown Creamery alone, never mind the many people who have since lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. To potentially add to this level of unemployment for no apparent good reason is baffling.KRL not only provides an efficient and cost effective service but worthwhile jobs to people who may otherwise struggle to find employment and are no doubt very concerned about their futures right now.This decision should be reconsidered."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I immediately hung up # wondering which of my frailties had been discovered # and phoned  which tells you the last number that called.I twice noted the number given by  and ventured to phone it. On dialling this number, the phone company advised me that there was #no such number#.Over a week, adopting identical procedures, five dferent #no such numbers# were found. The job of answering morning calls was then delegated to the message answering machine and only once did it receive a call which was terminated speedily by the caller without a message.Is there a flaw in our phone companies# systems with consequent loss of income  If this flaw could be eradicated, phone scammers might be less numerous and consequently afford a little more protection for the vulnerable.Going by theof John Newall#s reply to my letter on England#s disastrous Brexit, forced upon Scotland against our democratic wishes, I had expected better than the mishmash of worn out tropes and John Bull exceptionalism trotted out by Mr Newall.Mr Newall makes great play of the successful roll-out of the Covid vaccine in Scotland and the UK. He is absolutely right, it has been a fantastic achievement, but to then go on to use this success to denigrate the EU#s vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic.Our success is an illusion until both doses of vaccine are administered, crowing about vaccines when only . per cent of the UK population has had the vital second jag, compared, for example, to . per cent in Denmark, is both presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Newall goes on to assert that Scotland has a deficit that will prevent Scotland re-entering the EU, without of course mentioning the elephant in the room, the UK#s ruinous £ trillion # and increasing # debt. Unionists need to get their own house in order before lecturing anyone .Of course, legally, Scotland has no #deficit# or #debt#. How can a country with virtually no borrowing ability have a debt  What Scotland does have is a notional #debt#, the price of Westminster failure within the UK, where spending outwith Scotland#s control is assigned to Scotland, such as Trident, HS and London’s Crossrail. Spending that Scots taxpayers cough up for.Indeed,Courier readers start counting now at the rate of one a second, they#ll reach the number of pounds spent on Boris Johnson’s failed Track and Trace system at about .am on April  in the year . Readers may well wonder where the money went and why this is being loaded on to Scotland#s ledger.Straight from the #Better Together# playbook, Mr Newall brings up the hoary old #Spanish veto# myth. The truth is that Spain has no issue with an independent Scotland in the EU so long as this is within the framework of the UK constitution # which it is.Unlike Catalonia#s predicament, Scotland is not a #region# of the UK, there is no constitutional prohibition on independence votes or indeed of Scotland abrogating the  Treaty of Union with England.This is why successive prime ministers, from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron, have repeatedly recognised the right of the Scottish people to independence # and why Boris Johnson#s oafish #No# will run into the sand.Mr Newall and I will never agree but that is the essence of democracy, and the right to choose in a free country.Scotland can either remain, semi-detached and impotent, as part of an increasingly insular Little Englander Tory Britain, bringing in its wake further austerity and diminished le chances for our young people, or Scots can vote for independence, just like our neighbours.Yes, there will be dficult choices, yes, there will be mistakes, but they will be our decisions to get right as we work for the prosperous, open and internationalist country that is within our grasp.I am delighted that our council will be investing nearly £. million to help keep Argyll and Bute going and growing.After relentless campaigning from myself and others it#s great to see, at long last, some substantial investment in our crumbling infrastructure.Building on investments made in previous years, an additional £. million will be invested to drive forward improvements and repairs to Argyll and Bute#s network of roads in rural, remote, island and urban communities, bringing the overall roads reconstruction budget to £ million for  .We are also investing more in active travel, in line with the council#s agreed priorities. This includes a further £, in enhancing and improving footpaths. This investment complements the current allocation of £, in green transport and travel.This recent Covid pandemic has highlighted more than ever the need to tackle our urban-rural ide. Even now, many of my constituents are paying primum prices for snail#s pace broadband speeds.That#s why £, is being invested in a Tackling Digital Exclusion Top-Up Fund # to support people, businesses and communities to access improved digital connections for social and commercial opportunities supporting communities and in some cases iniduals that are missing out on national programmes due to logistics and economies of scale.While this budget is not perfect and there will be challenges ahead as we start to recover from the ongoing global pandemic this is a massive step in the correct direction.Now my constituents across the Kintyre and the Islands ward will quite rightly want to see action, not more talking.So that means more help for our small businesses, improving our digital connectivity and substantial improvements to our roads which in so many areas are sadly approaching the point of no .Six years ago, I had a sudden and le-changing stroke.

A final decision will be taken on Tuesday March , ahead of Passover, Easter, Ramadan and Vaisakhi.Ms Sturgeon said: #In recent weeks, we have seen a signicant fall in new cases, deaths and hospital admissions, and the vaccination programme is progressing beyond our initial expectations. All of this is excellent news, and provides strong grounds for hope, but that hope must also be balanced by caution.#The changes, while modest, are important, and are designed to help people#s health and well-being by enabling group exercise and allowing more social interaction. They will also let children see more of their friends, and exercise and play more normally.#With continued progress, we believe the reopening of places of worship can be achieved relatively safely, and will hopefully enable more people to draw strength, comfort and inspiration from acts of collective worship.#I expect that further, more substantial changes will be possible in the weeks ahead, and I will set out as much detail as I can about that in Parliament next week. If the data allows us to relax more restrictions more quickly than we have previously indicated, we will not hesitate to do so.#We all have a part to play in keeping case numbers down while the vaccinators do their work, children get back to school and we all take tentative but firm steps back to le as we once knew it, so please continue to stay within the rules and follow the FACTS advice.#"},{"url":null,"title":"district news march 12 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They are asking meit will take residents getting hurt before action is taken.#At the council budget we, as a council, put huge additional resources into infrastructure, in particular roads spending, so now there should be no more excuses and delays.#Skipness residents must be listened to and fit-for-purpose long-term work must be done.##The B is in dire condition and is causing increasing concern for residents and delivery services,# said Councillor Anne Horn.#I raised this issue again at MAKI area committee and the head of service advised the meeting that the repairs are prioritised for the next financial year. He also advised that residents will be notied of plans and progress for the roadworks.#This repair requires urgency and I will be urging officers to expedite the work without delay.#WEST KINTYRE:Applications for grants from this year#s first round of funding from the West Kintyre Community Council Wind Farm Trust are currently being accepted.Grants may be available for capital or revenue funding to support projects, groups, halls, charities and churches within the West Kintyre Community Council area, ranging from Whitehouse in the north to Kilkenzie in the south.Advice, details and application forms are available from convener Margaret Pratt via email at margaretpratt@btinternetThe closing date for receipt of applications is Wednesday March , and the disbursement meeting will take place virtually on Monday April .CARRADALE:Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis seeking Kintyre residents# views on the planned replacement of a submarine electricity cable between Carradale and Arran.The energy company is planning to install a  kilovoltcable which will run from Port na Cuile, Carradale to Balliekine on Arran.It comes after a routine inspection in August  of the two kV submarine cables providing electricity to Arran revealed the north cable, which runs from Port Crannaich in Carradale to Balliekine, was in poor condition with signicant damage to the protective armour # probably caused by contact with rocks.The armour of the cable to the south was intact so no further action was required.Following an assessment by engineers, SSEN decided to replace the north cable because a repair would be challenging and more costly due to its deep-water location and the extent of the damage observed.In order to gather opinions and answer any questions about its replacement plans, SSEN#s submarine cable team will be holding a pre-application consultation in the form of a series of four hourly online sessions between pm and pm on Thursday March .To register for the event, email submarinecables@sseAs well as seeking views on the project, SSEN is also looking for comments and opinions on its  #  investment programme."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 12 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Minutes later, the MFV steamed away from the village, minus the men.A Land Rover had earlier searched a wide area in vain for them.On Tuesday morning, three Marines called at the village bar and asked for sandwiches. An employee said they were obviously very tired and had just come from the hills.Contact was established with the missing men in the early hours of yesterday. They had been in the hills and were discovered by a Land Rover which had been searching for them.The men were yesterday trying to make their way back to the base at Plymouth. It is understood they have not been seen since the weekend.The men had, in fact, being separated for a time but had managed to meet up with each other, too late to catch the boat at a pre-arranged rendezvous.Council brevitiesThe cost of converting council-controlled coin-operated locks to take decimal currency was to be £.

Mr Wilson is trying to muddy the waters there.Whilst Mr Wilson is correct that Scotland cannot have debt , Scotland does have deficit, and the reason we know this is because the SNP-run Scottish Government tells us so in the annual Government Revenue and Expenditure, Scotlandbut Mr Wilson contradicts himself by going on to say that Scotland has a #notional debt# . Scotland has no debt. Scotland cannot have debt. Mr Wilson needs to realise that debt and deficit are two dferent things.With regard to HS, yes, Scotland pays a two per cent share of the total cost but will receive approximately . per cent back in Barnett consequentials. THAT is a very good deal for Scotland. London#s Crossrail  Not a single penny for that will be paid for by Scotland.Mr Wilson goes on to say that there is no #prohibition on independence votes#. Another error from him. Section  of The Scotland Act , the act which allowed us to have a devolved assembly and to which the then Scottish Office signed up, lays down the exact process required. We need permission from HMGov.Oh, and the notion that Scotland can abrogate the Treaty Of Union is also wrong. Whilst Westminster is a parliament of equals, it cannot of itself dissolve the Treaty of Union of which it was not itself a progenitor. That is the prerogative of the suspended national parliaments of England and Scotland, which will require to be recalled from suspension #in abeyance ad interim# where they legitimately reside at the present time. Only the recalled national parliaments of Scotland and England may re-negotiate the  Treaty of Union.I would take this opportunity to remind Mr Wilson of two things: we had a referendum in  and voted to stay in the UK, and he should really learn to live with that and in no election ever, General or Scottish, has the SNP garnered more than  per cent of the vote.The decision by Argyll and Bute Council to stop funding Kintyre Recycling Limited is perverse to say the least.No thought seems to have been given to the level and cost of the future support for the employees who will be thrown on the scrap-heap. Will that go to the social work department and will they get the same level of support as they do now No thought seems to have been given to the effect on the mental health of the employees # what support will be available and what budget will it come from How can the expenditure of a quarter of a million pounds be justied when the council is struggling for money and how long will it take to save this amount compared with the partial funding for Kintyre Recycling Limited It is shameful that only two of our local councillors are against vulnerable people being thrown on the scrap-heap when all three should be supporting their constituents.I am pleased to support the new business group set up to campaign for a quick and permanent solution for the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A.It’s now seven months since the landslide closed the A last summer. That should have been a wake-up call for the SNP Government, but all we#ve had since then is a failed attempt to protect the Old Military Road from landslides and talk of taking  years to solve the problem.This is just not good enough. We need urgent action now.Last week#s Courier letters page didn#t offer much hope. The SNP only wrote about independence, not the real issues facing us, such as the Rest and Be Thankful.The SNP Government should be concentrating on fixing the Rest and Be Thankful and recovering from the Covid pandemic, not spending its time plotting about independence.This Mother#s Day, school feeding charity Mary#s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary#s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world#s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary#s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That#s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary#s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother#s Day.

This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May#s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week march 12 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That is a tough place to be in.The first occasion, He told them to go out again into deeper water , on the second occasion,it was to cast the net on the right side of the boat. In both accounts, these fishermen caught so many fish the nets were at breaking point.Oh, that it could always be as straightforward as that!Right now, fishermen and their families are facing such a dficult time and feeling that their voices are not being heard. These Bible stories remind us that their need and cry is heard by Jesus, the one who chose fishermen as His companions whilst on earth.We too must not forget them and this important industry in our west coast communities. I hope you will join me in praying for them, not only for their daily safety but also for provision and wisdom.In these stories, there is a lesson for us all to think about. What obstacle do you face this week that could be overcome by changing our actions or by thinking dferently  We resist change particularly when something has worked for us in the past, but sometimes we need a dferent approach.Sometimes, like the disciples, we too can find that calling on Jesus gets us through."},{"url":null,"title":"woman tipped foul smelling water over man","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It was awful-smelling.#He added: #I got straight up, and saw a window open and there were drops of water coming down off the window.#He described the water as #vinegary smelling# and #rancid#. It was the man#s brother who called the police.The day this happened, July  last year, had been very hot and sunny.Stimson, who lived in a flat above, told the officers that it had been an accident she had opened the window and knocked over the glass. The window opened at an angle.Constable Alan Wallace said that the window had a sill and a lip which would have prevented the glass from tipping to the extent that a large amount of water would have been spilled.#You could see water residue on the window,# he said.In court, the -year-old woman said she had been warm, opened the window and the glass tipped, spilling some water and then she emptied the rest out. It had not occurred to her that someone might be sitting below.She panicked about telling the police she had done that, her defence agent Stephen MacSporran told the court.The glass contained a salt-water solution which had been there for two weeks.#I was lying on the bed. Listening to music, a meditation, it was very warm, I opened the windows,# Stimson said, #the glass tipped over.

On board, local villagers could see the shrouded figures of men taking cages filled with monkeys and guinea pigs to a pontoon a short distance away from their shoreline. A short time later, a veil of mist could be viewed upon the nearby stretch of ocean as poisoned gas was unleashed to test the effectiveness of a range of biological weapons ndash from bubonic to pneumonic plague ndash on the unfortunate animals. Their corpses would later be examined to determine the successof the experiment.The operation was shrouded in secrecy and at the time, the islanders knew only that local fishing boats were banned from sailing into a narrow stretch of waters and that youngsters from the village were discouraged from swimming nearby. Their confusion must have only increased when the fishing boat, the Carella from Fleetwood in Lancashire sailed into the area to be greeted by the flapping of red warning flags and the sounding of alarms. It would later emerge that scientists on board the Loch Lomond had feared the Carellarsquos fishermen might carry the plague back to their home fishing port in the north of England.It was a story I heard about in school. Raised in Ness, north Lewis, I stayed in Stornoway during the week while attending the local secondary and it would be whispered about in the school hostel and at the back of the bus as I ed home for the weekend.We knew little of what had actually happened aboard the Ben Lomond, other than it was one of two such experiments off the Western Isles. The first of these ndash in  ndash was named Operation Cauldron the second, which occurred the following year both off Tolsta Head and the Flannan Isles, was called Operation Hesperus, all part of a series of similar events known collectively as Pandora.The rest was a fog of half-truths and legends, tales that were as much guesswork as reality. There were some, for instance, who believed that the experiments involved a search for antidotes for chemical weapons rather than an investigation into how wellthey worked.A little light was shed on the exercise in the mid-s when some of the details involved in the Carella incident were discovered in a crumpled, highly classied file. Leaked to the Observer, the story appeared under the headline ldquoBritish Germ Bomb Sprayed Trawler in July . Questions were asked about the matter in the House of Commons by the Western Isles MP, Donald Stewart. Yet even after this and the subsequent questioning of Calum MacDonald, Stewartrsquos successor, much of the mystery remained. It is likely that Francis Pym, the Minister of Defence at this time, knew even less about the affair than the MP who was directing questions towards him.As a result of this vacuum, myths have grown. Among the tales I have heard is that the Carella was heading back to Fleetwood when the incident occurred.I have been told that cattle had to be slaughtered in Skye because of the effects of brucellosis and that the experiments caused a large cancer outbreak in Lewis the following year.I was also informed that a large number of dead monkeys and guinea pigs was washed up on Tragraveigh Mhor, one of Tolstarsquos beaches. Again, this hasnrsquot been veried.Together with a short account of one of the men aboard the Ben Lomond being arrested for causing a breach of the peace, it is these stories that helped me in the creation of my novel, In a Veil of Mist. While researching and writing the book, I have also come to know more of the truths that lie behind the tales. I am aware, for instance, that Operation Cauldron was not the work solely of the British government but also its United States and Canadian equivalents that other similar experiments occurred off the coastline of the Bahamas and less populated parts of the United States and Canada.I have learned that the civil servant Clive Ponting ndash the whistle-blower who leaked details of the sinking of the Argentinian light cruiser, General Belgrano during the  Falklands War ndash was also responsible for revealing what occurred in the Western Isles during Operation Cauldron. This was revealed when the Observer published his obituary following his death last year. Together with the release of a video in  that recorded the experiments taking place, this provided me and others with much more information about exactly what had occurred off Tolsta Head than wersquod possessed before.Despite the mysteries surrounding Operation Cauldron, it has, like the anthrax tests conducted in Gruinard Island, Wester Ross some  years previously, left a legacy among the local population. In the early months of the Covid- crisis, senior British politician Michael Govesuggested that the Scottish islands were perfect locations to develop strategies to end the lockdown, claiming there was ldquoscientic justication for piloting measures such as contact tracing and lting lockdown restrictions at a ldquoprogressively greater rate than on the UK mainland.The reaction towards his words was strong. Some pointed out that places like the Outer Hebrides had a larger percentage of older, vulnerable people among its population than most areas in the country, and that the islands had far too often been used for ldquoexperimentation. Its people were not to be employed as ldquoguinea pigs in any such scheme. The choice of this language is interesting in the context of both Operation Cauldron and Gruinard. It seems people have not quite forgotten what happened in this area seven decades ago.In a Veil of Mist by Donald S Murray is published on March  by Saraband, pound..

Her image is everything, a potent symbol of UK sovereignty abroad. Even the Scottish National Party buys into royal mystique and accords the monarch pride of place in its independence project. Not perhaps for much longer.This crisis is arguably worse than the Abdication in . Then, the monarchy was a robust and unchallengeable part of the British institutional landscape. Edward and his American orcee went into convenient exile and relative obscurity. Meghan isnt going quietly. She is a destroyer ndash a heat-seeking missile, and she was bang on target.Read more: Its time for the SNP to ditch its attachment to the Queen, that last remnant of empireShe accused the royal family of propagating hoods, failing in its duty of care, discriminating against her children, ignoring her suicidal tendencies and putting her familys le in danger by withdrawing protection. Her tale of victimhood has reverberated across the world and particularly in the Commonwealth of former British colonies. Nothing could be more damaging than the head of the Commonwealth being tainted with racism.Meghan has at her back an army of international celebrities led by Hillary Clinton, who accused the royals of ldquooutrageous cruelty astheyd held Meghan in a dungeon in the Tower. Brexit Britain was already being portrayed by the US media as a reactionary and xenophobic place. Now comes confirmation from within.It hardly matters that much of what the Duchess said was nonsense. She claimed that during her pregnancy she was not allowed to visit her friends and was only allowed out twice in four months. If thats true the royals were guilty of coercive control, a criminal offence. The isolation, she said, contributed to her mental health problems and resulted in ldquosuicidal thoughts for which she was given ldquono support.She said that she approached the human relations office and was told they couldnt help because she wasnt an employee. This is hardly surprising. The Sussexes had their own private office staffed by well-paid people whose job it was to look after her welfare. They could have bought the best psychiatric help on the planet. Her husband, Harry, even co-founded a charity for people with mental health issues, Heads Together. Did he ignore his own wes psychological deterioration Meghan complained that her son, Archie, had been blackballed by the Palace because of ldquoconcerns about his colour. She says she was told he would not automatically be a prince, which is true since the Queens great-grandchildren dont automatically take on the title. Archie could become a princeand when Charles, his grandfather, becomes king.But this was not about protocol, but race. She connected the unspecied ldquoconversations about his skin colour with the fact that Archie was being deprived of his royal title ndash at risk to his le. Its not clear which she thought was worse: the racism or the fact that she was told, again during her pregnancy, that her son would not have police protection.Was she suggesting here that her protection officers would have been withdrawn because Archie was not immediately to become a prince  That is plainly wrong. The royal protection squad would never have been taken from Prince Harry and his family while he remained an active royal. Security costs only became an issue when the couple said they wanted to leave, ldquostand back, from their royal roles and seek their fortunes in Canada and America. They couldnt have it both ways and continue to be funded by UK taxpayers after theyd departed for La La Land.Read more: Its time to abolish the monarchyIn one of many startling revelations Harry said: ldquoMy family literally cut me off financially.... His dad wouldnt answer his calls, either. Thats obviously an issue for the Prince of Wales, who holds the purse strings. But the Sussexes werent exactly left penniless. Harry had around pound million from investments left by his mother and Meghan had her own millions. They are getting poundm from Netflix and Spoty. Harry said that ldquogoing to the streamers was never part of the plan. Perhaps not, but since they intended to earn large sums of money to pay for their pound million Santa Barbara mansion, media work must have been in the back of their minds.There were predictable claims of racism in the British media. The press is disrespectful, sometimes cruelly so but, unlike social media, claims of actual racism against Meghan have never been substantiated. Yet the Duchess is now offering concrete proof that the royal family itself, the pinnacle of state privilege, is racist. Just how ldquodark would Archie be This was the cruellest cut of all, and one the Palace cannot allow to stand. The context of the remark, or remarks, was not made clear. It was Prince Harry who heard it and he was refusing to ldquoshare any more of the story. Yet hed already shared the greatest possible libel of his own family. There can be no charge more damaging to a institution today than that it harbours racists.Could it have been a misunderstanding  I was once accused of racism for saying that, when watching her legal drama Suits, it had never occurred to me that Meghan was black. It was only after she hooked up with Harry that I learned she was a Person of Colour. Butit was a similarly misconstrued remark, the Palace should make that clear. If it does not, the monarchy will be indelibly smeared.It is said, jokingly, that Meghans interview was a rehearsal for the next season of Neftlixs Crown.

This is because they can be passed on through droplets that we are more likely to come into contact with indoors from someone breathing or speaking close to us, or landing onto surfaces that we might touch. Indoor environments with poor air circulation means viruses stay in the air and can be recycled with poor ventilation, so we breathe them in more easily.There are examples from studies of Covid- transmission in restaurants, during choir practice, in work places, and in food factories. The most high risk area by a long shot is our own homes, where it is clear that sharing bedrooms, bathrooms or other living spaces provides multiple opportunities for infection to spread.Many months on from the start of the pandemic, researchers have been able to assess the risks of indoors vs outdoors. Late last year a review was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, suggest that the odds of indoor transmission are around  times higher than outdoors, based on research from Japan that analysed a series of cases and clusters of outbreaks. From all the published studies that the authors identied on Covid- from a number of countries, fewer than % of coronavirus infections happened outdoors.This type of evidence helps inform government guidelines in Scotland and where when deciding what changes can occur, and in what order, as stay at home restrictions are eased. The bottom line is that having a coffee on a park bench with a friend in the open air is much less risky in terms of Covid- transmission that popping into a friendrsquos house to do the same.It also contributes to why in Scotland children under  have been able to play outside in groups during lockdown, as policy makers have weighed up the risks of them losing out on exercise and social interaction with their peers vs infection risk to them . It explains why the easing of lockdown starts with small groups of adults and teenagers being able to meet outside in larger numbers than before ndash and why I expect hospitality venues to be able to serve customers outside rather than inside when lockdown eases this year, as was the case in .But going back to my point about how viruses evolve in nature, this doesnrsquot mean that we canrsquot lsquocatchrsquo Covid- outdoors. We can, but what determines risk outdoors is how close we are and how long we spend with others. You donrsquot need to be an expert in infectious diseases to understand that lots of people embracing, shouting or singing in close proximity outdoors means someone who is carrying the viruscan pass it onto someone .As we look ahead, there are some key measures that will allow larger outdoor gatherings in future. The first is that when people meet up outdoors, distancing still matters. If we are to get back to sporting events with punters in seats, then spacing will be key and will limit how many people can watch a match or attend an outdoor concert. Face coverings will help, particularly in communal areas outdoors, for example queuing to get in, or to access toilets.A further big question is how much vaccines will reduce transmission. Early findings are positive and may mean that, as in Israel, people who have been vaccinated can access indoor venues that others canrsquot. Israel is providing lsquogreen passesrsquo to people who have received both doses of a Covid- vaccine. These are shown on a mobile phone app to provide entry to indoor public venues such as gyms and hotels. This type of certication is controversial and could be a isive policy that will disadvantage those who donrsquot take up vaccines or are last in the queue for vaccination, like young adults and children. But it is actively being considered in a number of other countries.For now, we have spring and summer to look forward to in Scotland. We canrsquot rely on sunshine, but longer days mean we can do more outdoors. Many of us will be able to reconnect with family and friends while keeping the risk of infection low as vaccines continue to be rolled out.Linda Bauld is Chair of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

DAVID LEASK:Independence: Support for independence has changed the face of unionismThe channel  RT, the premier Western mouthpiece of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his authoritarian and kleptocratic regime. John Kerry, the former US secretary of state, summed up the station in two words: it is, he said, a ldquopropaganda bullhorn.George Galloway is a regular RT host. And so is Alex Salmond.I think it is worth pausing for a moment to think about this episode. Because this ndash however used to it we have become ndash is not OK.A Kremlin TV personality who is running for Holyrood on an ultra-unionist ticket is defending another Kremlin TV personality who is the darling of ultra-nationalists. And he is doing this on, yes, Kremlin TV.How did this happen The short answer: our polarised political eco-system makes us vulnerable to disinformation, and not just from Putin.RT and sister operation Sputnik ndash where another former radical, Tommy Sheridan, has been editorialising in favour of Salmond ndash are far from the only threats to reality-based political discourse in Scotland. But they are the easiest to spot.After almost a decade of endless constitutional politics, we now have tribalists ndash unionist and nationalist ndash who are prepared to give their heroes a pass on working for Putin media.What  are they ready to forgive  Do they care about what is true  Or just about winning  DAVID LEASK:Not being from Glasgow or Edinburgh gives me broader perspectiveThis is a huge red flag, and not the kind that once fluttered over the Kremlin.Putin TV has usually been seen ndash wrongly ndash as a Yes problem, not least after Salmond started a show on RT in .And a few ldquovery online Yessers have fallen for a core message that RT was no worse than the BBC they loathed.Nicola Sturgeonrsquos SNP has proved harder to dupe. Party insiders whisper their leader did not need to conspire against her predecessor, as his RT colleague Galloway claimed. Why  Because Salmondrsquos career was over the moment he signed up for the channel.There are still a few Yessers who shrug off worries about Kremlin outlets ndash despite them representing a regime which harasses supporters of independence movements.But with Galloway standing for Holyrood, for a list-only party called Alliance for Unity, some unionists are now sharing RT clips and links on social media.How has this come about ldquoThey fear that another referendum will bring a dferent result, explained David Clark, a former advisor to Labour Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and an expert in Kremlin influence campaigns. ldquoSo there is a sense that lsquoanything goesrsquo to try and prevent the outcome they fearhellip..This is an environment in which disinformation is able to flourish.There is a scent of desperation about unionism. I think propagandists, disinformation actors and plain grters of all kinds have snfed an opportunity. Just as they did when nationalism was struggling.ldquoUnionism is turning into a political wild west, explained Andy Maciver, a former Scottish Conservative strategist and Herald columnist.ldquoThey have become so emotional in their hatred of nationalism that they no longer seem capable of rational thought. So they are now content to jump into bed with someone who theyrsquove been calling a Communist for the last umpteen years, because at least hersquos a unionist Communist.Galloway is no Communist. He does, however, like his employer. Speaking to the Sunday Times last week, he rubbished concerns that the Russian president was an autocrat or that RT was propaganda.Why does he not criticise Putin, he was asked. ldquoBecause I like him, Galloway replied. ldquoI wouldnrsquot rant and rave about him because I agree with him. I agree with him on Syria. I agree with him on the geopolitical issues of the day.Galloway has been censured by the UKrsquos media watchdog because of his coverage of the  Salisbury attacks. He has cast doubts on whether the Putin regime attempted to assassinate anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny. And he has denied any suggestion of Kremlin interference in UK politics. He did all of this on RT, while preparing for an election campaign.I donrsquot believe many unionists will think these are credible positions. So why tolerate them just because they think ldquoanything goes to stop the SNP Disinformation watchers stress that there is nothing uniquely Scottish in any of this. Russian government media have been giving voice ndash and wages ndash to has-beens and isive fringe figures for years.Why does RT want both Salmond and Galloway ldquoTo fan flames,rsquo said Elisabeth Braw, a Swedish expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. ldquoThey are not trying to stir up a completely new feeling, they exploit whatever is already there.I doubt Putin media is backing a side. I think it is encouraging rancour ndash and looking for opportunities to tell its stories on topics it cares about, such as Salisbury, Ukraine, Navalny and Syria.Nina Jankowicz has long watched Kremlin outlets launder the reputations of old politicians. A fellow at Americarsquos Wilson Center, she wrote a book called How to Lose the Information War. DAVID LEASK:From Westminster With Love ndash are spies at work to stop independence Asked what she thought of those who back Putin over Navalny or Salisbury, she said: ldquoI hope we would never see Western politicians supporting a regime that used a military-grade chemical weapon to poison a dissident.ldquoThose who choose to appear on networks like RT should understand that their reputations are giving cover to a network that is the mouthpiece of such a regime.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

That problem continues to pose concerns, not least over whether the sizeable gatherings outside Ibrox and in Glasgowrsquos George Square might be repeated, perhaps at the upcoming Old Firm match.I watched Celtic draw with Dundee United last weekend, a result which guaranteed the Premiership for Rangers. Football fans will perhaps understand that my first thought was that my team, United, now had virtually no chance of securing a top six place in the league, and thus avoiding a possible relegation battle. BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralHowever, the wider consequences soon emerged as Rangers fans mustered to celebrate their teamrsquos success, in clear breach of rules prohibiting mass gatherings.Condemnation was swt from the First Minister, Opposition leaders and the police. While praising Rangersrsquo sporting achievement, they declared that the supportersrsquo actions were unacceptable and dangerous. They reminded us bluntly that closely packed crowds had the potential to spread disease and even death.Let us be clear. Parliament has the democratic power to prescribe rules. Within those rules, the police have a duty to proscribe behaviour which threatens the peace and, in this case, the health of citizens. Law and order must be maintained.The question is how. What is the truly effective way to prevent repetition  To do that, we need to understand the motivations underlying the behaviour we all witnessed.Otherwise, we risk making matters worse, we risk reinforcing a negative stereotype. To say this is in no way ndash I stress, in no way whatsoever ndash to condone the behaviour on display. It was dangerous and, potentially, deadly.Nicola Sturgeon has warned the Old FirmFirstly, I would broadly exculpate the police. You will hear it said either that they over-reacted or that they should have made far more arrests.The police did not create the situation. The fans gathered instinctively, emotively, no doubt prompted by social media. The police had to deal with events as they found them.An over-zealous response would have risked provoking the crowd, amplying the challenge to public order. Precisely the opposite of what the police were seeking to achieve.Secondly, consider the intrinsic nature of football support. We are dealing here with fans, or fanatics. For many, their le is defined by their vigorous adherence to their team. They exult in victory, they despair at defeat.This particular triumph for Rangers followed a decade without winning the league title a decade in which they had to rise from the lowest rank in Scottish football. In winning, they thwarted their greatest rivals.More generally, many fans regard their support for their team in an antithetical fashion to rival clubs, or even to society more generally. It is no accident that many supporters sing ldquonobody likes us, we donrsquot care. Their contrived self-image is as a beleaguered tribe, standing together against an external foe or an uncaring world.That is true of the most fervent of fans generally but it is particularly true of the Old Firm. Their adherents will often define themselves in contradistinction to the other side. Which can present a challenge for neutral observers or, indeed, for politicians seeking to intervene.Grimacing wryly, Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs this week that half of Glasgow presumed she was partisan for one side of the Old Firm while the other half presumed exactly the contrary. She was, she stressed, unconcerned about the colour of the shirt.It was also notable in Rangersrsquo official statement that they immediately drew attention to what they regarded as ldquoan unbalanced approach adopted towards their half of the Old Firm.In that same statement, Rangers insisted they had taken every step to pre-empt and deter such behaviour. It might be pertinent to note here that broader support for that analysis is distinctly limited. Further, eventhey were doing all they could, then those efforts demonstrably failed.Crucially, however, Rangers supporters will agree with their club. They will discern bias against them which others do not spot. Such a standpoint is not entirely unknown on the other side of the Glasgow sporting ide, nor indeed in football more generally. They are not known as fans for nothing. Once again, that does not remotely exonerate the behaviour we witnessed.However, it is also the case that there are many Rangers fans who will regret the scenes witnessed, who will seek to dispel any bad odour lingering around their clubrsquos remarkable success. As The Herald reported, supportersrsquo groups have raised thousands of pounds to repair damaged benches in George Square.Equally, though, those of us who are football fans need to reflect that many, perhaps most, people in Scotland are not. BRIAN TAYLOR:Sturgeonrsquos inquiry performance was thorough, respectful, controlled and capableRemember Brenda from Bristol  On being told that a further General Election was pending, she replied: ldquoYoursquore joking! What, another one !Translate that from Brendarsquos broad Bristol accent into Scots, and you have it pat. For many in Scotland, their reaction to another controversy in football is ennui. They find it weary, stale and flat full of sound and fury and signying nothing.In that light, we now need action which will be effective, rather than simply voluble. Perhaps a promise of substantial celebrations deferred, linked to the warning that the Old Firm game may have to be cancelled. Perhaps a reminder of possible sanctions by the European football authority.It will not be sufficient for that message to be delivered solely by politicians. Still less, by the police. That will not work with the truly zealous.Football leaders must douse their instinctive indignation and urge compliance. Consistently and without equivocation. In tandem with politicians and the police. It may be exasperating that such effort is required but anything  risks further failure.

Irsquom not even joking, I didnrsquot know I loved Irn Bru so much until I went away on tour and I couldnrsquot get it. I have one bottle chilling in the fridge ready to go.Egan added that one of the biggest changes since doing the show was her radio listening habits stating that she now automatically tunes into Capital, a nod to her skating partner, Capital FM DJ Sonny Jay saying: ldquoWhen I go into the car now I just tune into Capital automatically.She added: I didnrsquot know who he was when I was partnered with him because I didnrsquot listen to Capital Radio, and not being from London.ldquoI thinkyou werenrsquot from London he was a bit of an unknown, but he is such a good guy.

No positive impacts were noted.The report states that in Orkney, “the total impact is estimated as . FTE jobs and £, in gross salaries. These jobs and salaries will be lost in  under ATMS.”Mr McArthur has been calling on both HIAL and the Scottish Government to halt the centralisation plans for a number of years and has described the report’s findings as making this case ‘stronger than ever.’Commenting on the findings, Mr McArthur said: “We’ve known for months that HIAL’s plans are damaging for our islands, but the impact assessment has revealed the full scale of this decision for our community.“The report not only underlines what HIAL’s own advisers warned them at the very beginning, that this is the riskiest and costliest option, but also details in no uncertain terms that these proposals will have a detrimental long-term impact on our leline services and local economy.“Nobody has ever questioned the need to modernise air traffic control services but HIAL’s insistence that they do it by deploying ATMS is becoming less credible each day.#With costs for the project continuing to rise at a time when the aviation sector is facing considerable uncertainty, the case for halting the strategy is stronger than ever.“Ministers must also absorb responsibility for these damning findings and, along with HIAL, take heed of the warnings outlined in this reportwe are to safeguard air traffic services in the islands and uphold the credibility of island impact assessments.#Serious consideration must be given to calling time on these centralisation proposals.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This ensures that local authorities are fully funded to operate their internal ferry services.“This delivers a key ask from the Scottish Government#s local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Of course for Orkney it facilitates the introduction of Sunday services and Road Equivalent Tarfon inter-island ferries.“The Scottish Government has stated that it is well aware of the growing need for local authorities to replace ageing ferry fleets and infrastructure. While responsibility for funding replacement infrastructure remains with the councils, Scottish Ministers are committed to continuing engagement.“The passing of the budget also means £. million is coming Orkney Islands Council’s way, up £. million on last year — a . per cent hike.”Both Mr Leslie and Orkney#s MSP, Liam McArthur, welcomed increased spending in areas such as mental health services, education, green initiatives, business support and agri-environment.Mr Leslie added: “I am sure folk across Orkney will join me in welcoming this budget, there is plenty in it for islanders to be pleased about as we look to build a better, fairer and greener future for us all.”Meanwhile, Mr McArthur welcomed a number of concessions included in the budget, notably the additional funding for Orkney#s internal ferry services.But he says this now needs to be a long-term commitment from the Scottish Government and backed by support for new vessels.Commenting on the budget, Mr McArthur said: “Over the last year, along with my Scottish Liberal Democrat colleagues, I have sought to hold the government to account over its handling of this crisis. I have done so, however, constructively and with the interests of supporting constituents and our community at the forefront.“That approach has remained the same during this year’s budget negotiations and I’m pleased that we’ve secured funding for a number of areas that will be important for our country’s recovery. A signicant increase in investment for mental health services, for example, delivers on a key ask from the Scottish Liberal Democrats as we look to address our country’s mental health crisis.“The additional funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services is also very welcome after years of broken promises and Orkney being short changed.  It’s vital, though, that this is not just a one-off pre-election gesture but part of a long term commitment by government that also includes addressing the urgent need for new vessels.“Meantime, I’m glad that cross-party agreement could be reached on this budget at a time when politicians from all parties should be absolutely focused on putting the recovery first.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Carmichael said: “The DVSA appears to be taking a Central Belt approach to all corners of Scotland, whether or not that approach makes sense here — either that or they believe that all islanders get around by boat!“Driving is a necessity for many in the isles and we cannot afford to wait around for this backlog to be cleared — the DVSA needs to take specic measures to ensure that the isles are not left behind.”The joint letter sent to the DVSA head at one part states: “With relevant precautions and testing, some tests could take place in Orkney and Shetland, which would allow any backlog in the Northern Isles to be cleared.“We are therefore asking you to ensure that driving test examiners are posted to Orkney and Shetland whilst the Islands remain in Level Three to carry out the lawful execution of essential services.”Full story in this week#s The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was very tense in the last seven minutes, but a great relief that the precision and teamwork paid off.”Perseverance is an upgraded version of the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in . One of the engineers who worked on it was Alexander Nicolson – Mr MacRae’s neighbour in Budhmor.The former Portree High School pupil moved to Canada to work for Pratt  Whitney designing gas turbine engines. He moved to Calornia, where he still lives, in  to work in NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Regarding his work on Curiosity, Mr Nicolson said: “The amount of testing was incredible, we often even had to retest the equipment that was used to test components and assemblies of the rover.“The biggest challenge on something like this is working out what the worst conditions the rover might have to overcome will be, in terms of the temperatures and forces it is likely to meet.“They are such big projects though.

We’re not complaining about that — the ferry pays its dues — but we have to find a way of reconciling the effect that has on Ullapool#s tourist trade because the place where visitors congregate to admire the loch and the view is Shore Street.In addition, the -year-old sea wall will be replaced with a higher structure to protect the village from rising sea levels.As part of the pre-application consultation, an online Zoom meeting will be held tonight at pm when the proposals will be presented for the first time and as many people as possible are being urged to take part.To join the meeting people can visit the website: http:www.ullapool-harbour or phone    and enter meeting ID:  to listen in.Anyone who wishes to make representations can do so by contacting Fiona Henderson, Affric Limited, Lochview Office, Loch Duntelchaig, Farr, IV AW, or by email: consultation@affriclimited, by th March ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ARCHIVE-CENT-ANGUS-OG-6.jpg","title":"chust lovely angus og finds a new home in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe collection of the comic strips were handed over to the Skye and Lochalsh Archive Centre in Portree, in recognition of Angus Òg creator Ewen Bain and his family links to Skye.Ewen was brought up in Maryhill, Glasgow but his father John hailed from Waternish and his mother Flora from Staffin.

Larne RNLI’s all-weather leboat meanwhile, under Coxswain Frank Healy and with four crew members onboard, was erted from a training exercise and made its way to the scene.Red Bay RNLI began to work with the crew of the trawler to establish a towline while the all-weather leboat from Larne illuminated the scene in what were dark, wet and windy conditions.The leboat started a slow tow to bring the vessel back to Red Bay but the extreme weather forced the tow to part mid-way.Larne RNLI established a second tow and brought the trawler the remainder of the way into Red Bay where it was secured at pm.Both leboats were requested to launch once again this morning after the trawler began to drag its anchor out of Waterfoot. In much better conditions and daylight, Red Bay RNLI safely towed the vessel into the shelter of Red Bay.Speaking following the call out, Larne RNLI Coxswain Frank Healy said: ‘Weather conditions on scene last night were extremely challenging for all involved and I would like to commend our volunteers both here and in Red Bay for their teamwork over the three and half hours as they worked in darkness amid Force  winds gusting up to  knots and high seas.

Back on Main Street, tattered Slaughtneil flags hang outside the Dugout Bar, clinging on in defiance as it continues to wait for a reopening commitment. Two men in caps are chatting outside Kellys Eurospar. A woman opens the door of the pharmacy across the road and calls out.

The chapel and Fairhill Youth Centre are deserted, but at Crawfordsburn four children move in tandem on the swings. Two teenage girls walk down Glenview, eating from a bag of chips. Its a case of small mercies for the young amid the pandemic. An empty playground at Crawfordsburn. Children have been hit hard by the pandemic. A mounted sign at the entrance to Crawfordsburn Drive urges Solidarity with Palestine. Across the road, a more understated sign from Watty Grahams GAC urges people to take home their rubbish. On the way back in the road, the play park is once again deserted. Neither young nor old are hanging around too long these days. At the corner of Fairhill, McKennas Bar is operating their off licence, and doing a brisk Friday afternoon trade. A table cordoning off the entrance and a screen that drops down from the ceiling bring a sobering reality to the scene. Caitliacuten McKenna is actually reading the Derry Post as I arrive and says it might be the first time shes given us her real name. Shes referring to the Out and About pictures, smiling revellers appeasing the photographer for a two-page spread that is sadly no longer a possibility. For now. Caitliacuten, Caoimhe, and owner Sean McKenna, are all pining for those better days. “Last summer was good craic out in the beer garden,” says Caitliacuten. “Wed always had that space but we revamped it a good bit to make more use of it. Even people who knew it was there were surprised at how big it was when it was overhauled. “Its not too hard to get your , steps a day carrying pints out there.” “Its been a big change, serving people through the hatch and not letting anybody in. Youd have been used to people around the bar a lot of the time,” adds Sean. Sean, Caoimhe and Caitliacuten McKenna hard at work in McKennas Bar. “This is a social hub, youd have had people in and out all the time, whereas out there, though they may be some of the same people from the bar, theyre only staying for a minute and away they go again. “Another change is Im sitting at home on a Friday or Saturday night from  oclock thinking I should be doing something.” The flow of customers interrupts our chat. People finishing up work for the weekend, some calling in on a whim, others a more regular sight. Caoimhe tells me it has been hard on those regulars for whom the pub is very much an arena for conversation. “You do get some who will stand and have a wee chat, because its maybe their only social interaction,” she says. “Its been a while since theyve seen some people, so you get a wee bit of gossip out there that you miss out on having the bar closed. “Then when it gets to  oclock, its mad out there, just before closing. Everybody ends up having a chat with each other at the hatch. “Theyre more likely to meet someone they know then. You also get a lot of people waving in while they are out for their exercise as well.”  We mention the general dferences between the current period of restrictions and the previous lockdowns, but its interesting to view them through the lens of the pub owners. “People arent buying as much drink as they were the first time round,” says Caoimhe. “The weather isnt the same and people cant sit outside in their gardens at the minute. It was a novelty, and people were almost treating it like a holiday. “The town is busier than last time round. It was really, really quiet before, but there is definitely more traffic and more people about than the previous lockdown. “We have noticed a wee bit of a change with a lot more people buying craft beer that they might have had access tothey were out in bars further afield – Belfast or Derry maybe. “A lot of people were making cocktails the first time down. People were asking for all sorts of things at the start that wed never had before because they were making cocktails.” On the way out, Sean draws my attention to the crystal Kalashnikov hanging above the off licence tills. From Russia with love. Covid-, a less welcome import from the East, has brought down a muffled filter on the streets of our towns and villages. Conversation is terse, interaction limited. Hope might spring eternal but you cant gulp on it forever. Magheras Covid rate fell into double figures last week, and despite a slight increase this week, expectant eyes turn towards the decisions of the NI Executive. Heading home on the Coleraine Road, the site of the old police station is busy with construction, the new leisure facilities moving closer to completion. Maghera is poised and ready when normality gets the green light.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Mountain Between Us: Friday   RTEacute One @ .pm A man and a woman in a rush hire a private plane that crashes smack bang in the middle of the Rocky mountains when the pilot has an ill timed stroke. No one knows where they are and they havent a clue what to do.

Plus the scenery is absolutely magnicent. Maps To The Stars: Friday, BBC @ .pm A trip into the slimy and sleazy underbelly of the rich and famous of Hollywood courtesy of David Cronenberg.

The Job Retention Scheme was introduced last March to support businesses and organisations who had to temporarily lay off staff due to the pandemic. The government said it would pay up % of the salary of employees placed on furlough. At one stage, the local council had placed  employees on furlough. The council had agreed to pay the remaining % of the furloughed workers salaries during the lay-off period to ensure they received their full pay. Almost half of the council employees have ed to work but  remain on furlough. Details on the money saved by the council as a result of the furlough scheme were outlined on Tuesday at a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Committee. googletag.cmd.push A report shared with councillors at the meeting revealed that from March last year to January this year, the council had recouped a total of pound,, from the furlough scheme. The furlough scheme had been due to end on April  next. However, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, this week announced that the scheme would be extended to the end of September this year. The Job Retention Scheme has protected more than  million jobs since its inception last year and has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as businesses remain shut. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two years ago, the council commissioned Playboard NI to carry out a detailed audit of all the play facilities available in the local area. The findings of the audit were outlined yesterday at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. Alan Herron, Director of Service Delivery and Development with Playboard NI, told the meeting that they had inspected  play parks in the council area in November and December . They had also consulted with the local communities to find out their views on the play facilities. googletag.cmd.push Mr Herron said the parks had been awarded scores in relation to their standards. The audit report showed that in the council area, only six play parks secured enough points to be placed in the top band. These included Brooke Park, Pennyburn Play Trail, Ballyarnett Play Park and Strathfoyle Park. A total of  parks were assessed to be in the upper mid band category which means they offer a good level of play value but require ongoing maintenance. Some of the local parks in this bracket were St Columbs Park, Galliagh Park, Irish Street Park, Rose Court and Lapwing Way. googletag.cmd.push The next bracket was lower mid band and  parks in the Derry and Strabane council area were placed in this category. In Derry, these included Oakland Park, Shantallow Park, the Fountain Park, Bull Park and Primity Crescent. According to the Playboard NI report, these parks offer a low value of play value and will require upgrading to bring them up to an adequate standard. The final bracket was called the lowest. A total of  parks within the council area were placed in this category by Playboard NI, who said the facilities currently offer a minimal level of play value.     Among the local parks listed in this lowest bracket are Stevenson Park, Fountain Hill, Currynierin, Rossdowney Drive, Hazelbank and Ballynagard. The Playboard NI report put forward a number of recommendations on how the local play facilities can be improved. Karen McPhillips, the councils Director of Environment and Regeneration, said they have started to consider the high level costs needed to improve local play facilities and how the funding can be secured. She said the cost would run to tens of millions of pounds. “We do need to think about how we are actually able to do that and the number of funding sources and cocktail funding that we have in the past been very successful at using to refurbish and develop play facilities and can continue to do so, she said. “The better the funding strategy and the more finances as a council we are able to both lever in and create through our own capital plan, the quicker we will be able to get through all of these.” It was agreed at the meeting that a detailed plan should be put together on the costs involved in upgrading the play facilities and brought before councillors later this year for approval.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two years ago, Derry City and Strabane District Council commissioned Playboard NI to carry out a detailed audit of all the play facilities available in the local area. The findings of the audit were outlined yesterday at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. The report found that more than a third of the  parks in council area were of a poor standard. This included the Currynierin park. Speaking at the meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson said the details of the audit report highlighted the scale of the task that is in front of us all in relation to improving local play facilities. googletag.cmd.push He said he had a number of concerns, particularly in relation to areas of the Waterside. Cllr Jackson said many of the issues had been red-flagged for a considerableof time. He said a consultation had been carried out with the community in Currynierin and a new play facility had been designed for the area and taken through the planning process. He said the project has been spade-ready for a number of years but work has not started. “As a council we have built up expectation in the local community but we delivered absolutely nothing,” he said. “It is not good enough that we bring play facilities or schemes up to the stage where it is spade-ready and then it sits on a shelf.” googletag.cmd.push Cllr Jackson asked for a report to be prepared by council officers specically on the Currynierin park plans to show what funding opportunities have been explored and what barriers have been put in place in relation to the delay with the project. Cllr Jacksons comments were supported by Alliance councillor Philip McKinney who described the current play facilities in Currynierin as an absolute disgrace. Cllr McKinney said thatchildren from the area wanted to use good playing facilities they have to cross two busy roads to access a play park in Drumahoe. In response, Colin Kennedy, the councils Parks Development Manager, said that a funding application for the Currynierin park had been submitted to the Department of Justice but it had been unsuccessful.     He said a further application had been made to the Department of Communities for the necessary funding but added that bid had been left undetermined. Mr Kennedy said they would bring back a comprehensive report on what has been done to date in relation to the proposed Currynierin park and what the next stages are. He added that there was a huge amount of work to be done on how the council is going to find the funding to deliver on all the proposed play schemes in the local area. DUP Alderman David Ramsey described the park at Rossdowney Drive in the Waterside as dangerous and said that what equipment remained needed to be removed and replaced. It was agreed at the meeting that a detailed plan should be put together on the costs involved in upgrading the play facilities and brought before councillors later this year for approval.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The call comes from Lilian Seenoi-Barr, from the North-West Migrants Forum, who was speaking after figures showed the Derry and Strabane district recorded the biggest increase in racist incidents in the North last year, as well as the second-largest increase in racist crimes. Speaking to the Derry News, Mrs Seenoi-Barr said: “Racism and hate crime instil fear into entire communities and undermine social cohesion. “We cannot allow such fundamental rights violations to persist at their current high levels. googletag.cmd.push “We need to have serious conversations about race and racism in Derry before it gets out of hand. “It is now time for Derry City and Strabane District Council to develop a local action plan to tackle racial inequalities and racism in Derry. “We also need political and religious leaders in the city to take a proactive approach to tackle racism and prejudice towards people of minority ethnic backgrounds. They cannot simply be bystanders. “Political will and leadership are vital to countering racism and hate crime. The opportunities enjoyed by both political and religious leaders to shape opinions and set agendas come with a responsibility to unequivocally denounce expressions of racism and related intolerance.” googletag.cmd.push Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has said the new figures were very concerning. “There is no place for racism in our community. “It’s imperative on us all to work together as a society to stamp out racism and a build a more equal society free from discrimination. “All incidents of racism should be reported to and dealt with by the police.” On Monday, Mrs Seenoi-Barr was among a number of anti-racism groups who met with local councillors to discuss racism, sectarianism and anti-semitism. During the meeting, she told councillors that the Derry City and Strabane area had seen the largest increase in racist incidents between January  and December , adding that in her view it was fair to say we are going backwards in relation to racist incidents in the city.     Foyle SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin described the reported rise in racists in- cidents in Derry and Stra- bane as deeply disturbing.  She said: “In Derry we are proud to call ourselves a welcoming city but these statistics expose how that welcome does not always extend to all. “It is also incredibly worrying that so few victims actually receive justice. Of the  racist hate crimes recorded in Derry and Strabane policing area last year, outcomes such as charges or cautions were recorded in just four cases from April to December. “I suspect that these statistics only just scratch the surface. The PSNI must work to build trust with black and minority ethnic communities and ensure victims are adequately supported. That must be an urgent priority. “Every single one of us has a role to play in actively challenging racism, in all its forms, within our communities. These conversations arent always going to be easy or comfortable, but they are absolutely vitalwe are to stamp out racism and build a society in which everyone feels safe and respected.” Meanwhile, a UUP councillor on the local authority has apologised after making insensitive comments in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement during Mondays meeting. Alderman Derek Hussey said the Black Lives Matter movement was not fully inclusive, and added that this weeks meeting was addressing issues which go beyond Black Lives Matter However, in a statement issued by his party the following day, he said: “I apologise for my comments which were insensitive. “I was grateful for the opportunity to hear from those who presented and to expand my own understanding of racism in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist Party opposes all forms of racism and we want to see hate crime legislation strengthened in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Completion of the work is subject to favourable weather conditions and the Department will keep the public informed of any change. All work will be carried out in line with current public health and health and safety advice, with safe systems of working in place for staff and contractors. googletag.cmd.push In the interests of public safety and the safety of the contractor’s workforce the public is asked to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with extra care when travelling in the vicinity of the works.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Irish football’s financial dependency on supporters was highlighted once again when respondents were asked why they wanted toto stadia as soon as possible. The most popular ‘Priority ’ was financial support for clubs and teams. The social and community element of football also shone through too, with the second and third most popular choices being: Football is my main pastime and It’s a social outlet for me.     On measures that would encourage supporters toto grounds once it’s safe to do so, masks were seen as an important consideration: -A requirement to wear a mask around the ground Phased exit -Being able to attend with the people I normally go with -Assigned seating  Just over a quarter of respondents had the opportunity to attend a League of Ireland fixture after grounds opened up again with limited capacity last summer. The vast majority that had this opportunity felt the guidance and instructions provided were ‘Very clear’ and, when asked to share additional feedback, comments strongly commended clubs for their work in ensuring games were safe and followed protocols.

The vast majority of supporters want toas soon as they possibly can and are hugely supportive of any public health guidance and the stadia protocols that will allow that to happen,” Niamh O’Mahony, Secretary of the Irish Supporters Network , said. “The reasons why are also important to highlight – fans think about their clubs’ finances, football being their main pastime and football being a social outlet. That sense of community and belonging is key. The League of Ireland is underpinned by the dedication of supporters and volunteers and, as one respondent said, fans and passion drive this league more than anything . That same passion has been largely missing from grounds for the last  months. She continued: “Feedback from the games in the second half of  was really positive in terms of the clubs implementing public health measures and ensuring fixtures were run in a safe and organised manner. ISN, CRISC and YBIG Mandate have been meeting with the FAI regularly on this issue to ensure the voice of supporters is heard and taken into account in the ongoing Return to Stadia work. The data also speaks for itself – not a single Covid- outbreak was linked to League of Ireland games or training in , and clubs, volunteers and supporters can all take credit for that.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Fermanagh teenager signed from Irish Premiership side Ballinamallard until Thursday, July  and has played in all three of the Candystripes warm-up games so far. Glynn, who is in the first year of his Environmental Planning course at Queens University Belfast, has played under Declan Devine in the IFAs Club NI developmental pathway. In his early days, Micheaacutel played for Enniskillen Rangers before moving to Ballinamallard for the next six years, including two in the first team and being part of the squad beaten by Crusaders in the  Irish Cup Final. googletag.cmd.push “I was on the bench and disappointed not to get on, but nothing I can do,” Glynn points out. “I was playing soccer up to U with Club NI and Northern Ireland Us in the Euros. Whenever I got in to do my A-Levels, I didnt have as much time for soccer.” He is also a talented Gaelic footballer. His attacking prowess helped his school St Michaels Enniskillen to prestigious MacRory and Hogan Cup titles in . It attracted the attention of Fermanagh senior manager Ryan McMenamin, but Glynn turned down offers to join up with the Erne squad to concentrate on his soccer career. googletag.cmd.push “Declan got in contact with Ballinamallard manager Harry McConkey and I had worked with Declan through the IFAs Club NI system for a couple of years at U and U,” Glynn told The Derry News. “When he heard the Ballinamallard season was null and voided, he gave Harry a call to seeI would be interested in giving it a go until July. It was an open offer, so I couldnt turn it down and in July, Derry can either offer me a contact full time or I can go back to Ballinamallard.” Glynn joins other signings Marc Walsh, Will Patching, William Fitzgerald and Joe Hodge ahead of Derrys league opener, away to Longford next Saturday.     Just three days after his arrival at the Brandywell, Glynn played  minutes in the first game, a goalless draw against Bray, followed by another  minutes in a - draw with Finn Harps and half an hour last Sunday against Bohemians, another game ending goalless. “I have been training nearly every day, as much as I can. Im trying to get the minutes in because its been a while since I have played soccer,” points out Glynn, who hasnt featured since Ballinamallards pre-season. “At the minute, I am enjoying it and its going well so far,” he adds. At the minute, it involves a -mile round trip from his home in Derrygonnelly. “The team are training four mornings a week and Im in for all of them, it changes every week with the friendlies. I am in no set routine, but hopefully when the season starts Ill get into a routine and be more settled.” Glynn speaks of the buzz in the Derry camp, with the hopes of getting their season off to a winning start against Longford, who were promoted from the First Division after a - win over Shelbourne last season. “Its exciting, there is good hunger in the squad to succeed,” Glynn said of his progress so far. “I have played with a few of the lads before and they have been great and very welcoming. “It is a very young squad, there are a few lads who have been there and done that and they are setting a great example. Declan has been telling us to learn from them as best as you possibly can.” “For now, it is a matter of keeping pushing, keep the head down in training every day and see what comes of it. Hopefully things go well.” Derry lost - at Dundalk in last seasons opener and chase a first winning start since their - win at home to UCD in . In the last  seasons, the Candystripes have won their first game on four occasions, drew - with Shamrock Rovers in  and last the other five.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I knew Mick well, and the way he looked at me when we shook hands, I just got the feeling he was out to beat us that day. I went back to the dressing room and reappraised things with the lads. I told them there was no way Kildare were going to beat us on our own patch. We were down a few men because of injury, but we beat them. We won all seven games in a group that also saw us play teams like Leitrim, Carlow, Tipperary and Longford. We met Derry in the league quarter-final that April in Breffni Park. They hit us with two early goals and at one stage, led us by - to -. But once we got going, we played well and Derry didn’t score again. We beat them by a point, - to -. I think Tommy Ryan got his jaw broke in that game. We played Clare in the semi final in Croke Park. They were Munster champions and going well but we came through to qualy for a league final meeting with Dublin. We played reasonably well against the Dubs, although not as good as we would have liked. They had a man sent off, I think it was Charlie Redmond. We were level going into the final few seconds and right at the end, Barry Cunningham was making his way towards goal when the Wexford referee, Brian White blew for full-time. It was back to Dublin again the following Sunday for the replay. We played poorly. Even though they had Tommy Carr sent off, they beat us by four points, - to -. Ulster Championship In the first round in Ulster, we beat Antrim in Ballybofey. They were hungry and full of running but Martin McHugh was brilliant for us and we beat them by three points. That put us into the Ulster semi-final against Armagh. It was back to Breffni Park again. Armagh were a good side and it was a really close game. I put Michael Gallagher and John Duffy in towards the end and they helped us battle for a draw. The following week, we were back for a replay. Kieran McGeeney had made le dficult for Martin McHugh in the first match, so I decided to play Martin at full-forward in the replay. McGeeney followed him in, but he wasn’t suited in there and we got in for a couple of goals. Duffy had a fine game and we won comfortably, - to -. The Ulster final that year will be remembered for the state of the pitch after endless showers in Clones. Even the week beforehand, there were concerns about the state of the pitch in Clones. But that day, the rain was awful. We were late for the match because of traffic delays. And in the minor match beforehand, one of the Tyrone players suffered a broken leg. I seem to remember us considering not fielding at all. It didn’t seem right to be playing a game in such conditions but the Ulster Council were having none of it. They insisted the game would go ahead. We were down a lot of men that day because of injury. I had no Rambo Gavigan and Donal Reid was also missing out of the half-back line. Anthony Molloy wasn’t fit to start because of injury and we were without Tony Boyle too. I started John Duffy and he’d a good game. But in hindsight, I probably should have gone with Tommy Ryan that day. Remember he’d suffered a broken jaw, but he would have been well suited for that game. James McHugh Derrys Johnny McGurk shake hands after the  Ulster Final.We led - to - at half-time, but the second half belonged to Derry and in particular, Anthony Tohill. He was simply outstanding. I brought Molloy on late in the game, but by that stage, Derry had done enough. They beat us by two points, - to -. We only got one point in that second half. After the game, there were big celebrations among the Derry fans. I got struck twice after the final whistle by Derry supporters. I remember Jackie Reilly, Eugene McHale and my nephew Terry coming over to me, ‘cause they saw I was surrounded by Derry supporters. It was one of those things. In fairness, one of those supporters who struck me came and apologised to me some time afterwards. I didn’t say much about it at the time. It was just one of those things that happened. I actually met up with Eamonn Coleman ahead of their All-Ireland semi-final in which they would play Dublin and we talked tactics. We would both give our all on the sidelines in games, but with Eamonn, once the whistle blew at the end of a match, all was forgotten. Derry went on to win their first All-Ireland at the end of that season, and I was delighted for them. That day as we left Clones, we were deeply disappointed. Remember, these lads had given plenty of years to the county jersey at that stage. I was thinking that perhaps the time was up for myself as manager. But on the bus home, Anthony Molloy came up to the front where I was sitting and asked me to give it another year. I wasn’t really sure what to do, but when Anthony asks you to stay, it’s hard to say no.

"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10Mar2021-Closing.jpg","title":"Closing date nears over Irish Street development  ","story":"THE planned redevelopment of the former Irish Street police station site in Downpatrick takes an important step forward next month.That is when developers will be formally asked to submit their bids to redevelop the site which stretches as far back at St Patrickrsquos Avenue and also includes a number of empty buildings adjacent to the former police base and the Irish Street car park.Five developers and  community groups have expressed an interest in the site with its regeneration being spearheaded by the Department for Communitiesand Newry, Mourne and Down Council.A draft development brief mdash paving the way for the regeneration of the sprawling site mdash is expected to be formally signed off shortly, once lawyers for the government department and local authority have had an opportunity to examine and approve it.Developers will then be given up to  weeks to submit their proposals with a final assessment made around September, leading to the selection of a preferred bidder who will be responsible for all planning and construction costs.Once a developer has been selected, he will be given a year to secure planning approval and to complete the regeneration of the site within three years.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Some members of a working group, which includes council and DfC officials, Downpatrick councillors and business community representatives, are also keen to see work carried out to help make Downpatrick town centre pedestrian friendly to help ldquoencourage creativity and attract more visitors.During a recent meeting of the group it was confirmed that it is hoped to retain all the spaces at the car park and also redevelop the facility into a welcoming feature.The working group will also be given the first opportunity to review the scheme proposed by the chosen developer which is designed to regenerate the heart of the town centre.An entrance to the development site from Lynn Doyle Place has been suggested, with the developer encouraged to engage with residents who live at this part of the town.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.While it has also been suggested extending the perimeter of the regeneration site this has been ruled out as a non-starter as it would serve to delay the planned redevelopment.In the near future, as part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics will appear on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.A progress report on the Irish Street scheme was outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee and has been welcomed by Cllr Dermot Curran.He said he hopes the timetable which has been outlined will be realised to provide a major boost to the social and economic regeneration of Downpatrick town centre and has welcomed the emphasis on helping revive the night time economy.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe opportunity to redevelop a huge swathe of town centre land will not happen again and it is important that we get it right for everyonersquos benefit. The redevelopment plan has the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades.News of progress to redevelop the town centre site comes after recent confirmation that the location is one of a number of high profile schemes included in a real estate portfolio designed to attract potential national and international developers and investors.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local councils which are part of the Belfast Region City Deal consortium and is hoping for a share of a near poundbn Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive investment package.As work to secure city deal funding continues, the local authorities which form the consortiumhave come together to launch a new portfolio of real estate development opportunities within their respective areas with the aim of attracting global investment, boosting tourism and creating sustainable regeneration.The Irish Street regeneration proposal is one of  schemes being showcased in the so-called Belfast Region Investment Guide which have been identied by the ious councils. The portfolio details potential uses for each site with the guide used to market the development opportunities to developers and investors, both locally and overseas.City Deal members say the compilation of the portfolio is the next step in the progression of the consortium with the overriding aim of creating more and better jobs and attracting investment.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure money from the city deal for a multi-million pound flagship tourism project in Newcastle, with the so-called Mournes Gateway proposal a series of ambitious projects which includes a gondola ride into the heart of the Mourne mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10Mar2021-Council.jpg","title":"Council 159% rates rises third lowest in province  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has imposed the third lowest rates rise in Northern Ireland.The above inflation .% hike to fund the local authorityrsquos poundm budget was unanimously agreed last week by local politicians who described the increase as ldquofair and balanced.New figures confirm that the rise was the the third lowest across the provincersquos  councils, while three local authorities mdash Antrim and Newtownabbey, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid Ulster mdash froze their district rate.The smallest increase of .% was made by Mid and East Antrim Council with the second lowest imposed by Fermanagh and Omagh Council mdash .%.With Newry, Mourne and Down in third spot in terms of the lowest increase, fourth place went to Derry City and Strabane Council which increased its rate by .%.Belfast City Council hiked rates by .%, while Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon sanctioned a .% rates rise. Ards and North Down Council agreed a .% rise, which equates to an extra pound a month for ratepayers.The highest increase of .% was imposed by Causeway Coast and Glens Council will see average household bills increase by pound..The majority of councils have have agreed to increase annual rates bills which are calculated by combining the district rate which they set with the regional rate set by Stormont.While the Northern Ireland Executive has frozen the regional rate for households and businesses for the coming year, Stormont finance minister, Conor Murphy, has outlined a poundm rates support to businesses in the new financial year.

Cars parks across the resort were full for most of the weekend.People who live in the resort are particularly concerned that with the deadly coronavirus still in circulation, such a large influx of visitors has implications for public health.Local politicians had also highlighted the need for people to continue exercising social distancing and adhering to public health advice, insisting that there was no room for complacency at this crucial time, despite and increase in positive Covid cases across the district and the roll-out of a comprehensive vaccination programme.Senior Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials had met with police ahead of another anticipated busy weekend in a bid to signicantly reduce the number of visitors, with council officials placing cones in the Tollymore and Bryansford areas, with others located at Carrick Little near Slieve Binnian and in the Mournes.In addition, police set up a number of rolling checkpoints on the main approach roads to Newcastle last weekend, with officers also deployed in the heart of the resort.Police also managed parking at the hugely popular Bloody Bridge area on the outskirts of the resort, expressing concern that some drivers had shown little care or attention for pedestrians or other road users by the way they had parked their vehicles, one of which was a Transit van.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke, has praised the response from PSNI, local council, the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the emergency services and others for their response to managing visitors to main tourism hotspots.He said there was a greater presence on the ground which has been welcomed by residents following the ldquodangerous level of visitors who flocked to Newcastle and other ious parts of the district the previous weekend.ldquoI welcome the co-operation between all the ious agencies to improve the safety of residents, continued Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe local council placed traffic cones in a number of areas popular with visitors, while the PSNIhad vehicle checkpoints at main arterial routes into Newcastle area. There were also a number of mobile police patrols in the resort, with tickets issued to motorists for causing an obstruction at a number of areas including the Trassey Track and Bloody Bridge.Cllr Clarke said these measures helped ease the pressures on what he described as ldquonatural environmental treasurers as the district moves into the Covid recovery phase.He added: ldquoIt is clear that extra resources are required to manage and maintain our rights of ways, forests, beaches and our parks. The local council and PSNI will continue to share social media messaging on restricting travel to within  miles, with police confirming that they will continue to remain active across the entire district, not just Newcastle.Many people took to social media after another busy weekend to ask why visitors from outside the district who had travelled quite a few miles were not stopped and sent home.

So I started to think about what I could do and this is where the business came from.After  years of working with adults with learning disabilities, Louise came up with the idea of creating sensory boxes.ldquoRiley is registered blind and is deaf, so he needs a lot of sensory input. I came up with the idea of providing affordable sensory toys and products for children who need them, explained Louise.ldquoAs a special needs mum, I find thatyou go online to find sensory toys, they are hugely expensive.ldquoIrsquove spent four years buying stuff for Riley and I have a good idea of the things that you wouldnrsquot necessarily buy as a sensory product, but that will provide a similar sensory experience.ldquoI tailor my boxes to the child and find out about their sensory needs to determine what type of things would help them, such tactile items or fidget stuff to help with concentration and children who are hyperactive, or visually stimulating items such as light-up toys, calming products or growing products for a darkened room. There are so many sensory needs out there.Louise has been supported from the Go For It Programme in association with Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The programme is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Louise sells mostly through her Facebook page and word of mouth recommendations.ldquoI put up a post on Shop Ireland and I wasnrsquot really expecting the numbers of responses that I got. In the run-up to Christmas I had  orders. I had to turn people away, she explained.The support of the Go For It programme was a key part of the impetus to get the business up and running.The programme is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies and provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Louise joined the Go For It scheme through Down Business Centre and was able to access training.ldquoIt gave me the expertise in what to concentrate on first - I went and saw the accountant and got registered, she says.ldquoI was a bit apprehensive because I had absolutely no business experience, just a good idea. But the project gave me the reassurance that it was a good idea and we have put together a business plan.ldquoJoan OrsquoHara has helped me massively throughout the last few months and continues to be available for guidance should I need it or would recommend the best people to talk to in the subject I need.More recently, Louise has got her mum involved, branching out into making tactile and fidget cushions which are suitable for dementia patients and people with ADHD, autism and anxiety.Cllr Laura Devlin, chairwoman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council said: ldquoThe Go For It Programme provides new entrepreneurs with accessible, free and tailored support in the start-up stage of her business in areas such as financial and business planning, and sales and marketing to help get their business up and running.ldquoI wish Louise every continued success in developing and growing her enterprise and encourage anyone thinking about starting their own business to get in touch with the Go For It Programme.Joan OrsquoHara, business advisor at Down Business Centre added: ldquoItrsquos great to see Louise doing so well with a product that will undoubtedly support a childrsquos development through sensory play.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni.

favour of the plan going ahead.Members of St Patrickrsquos Board of Governors have urged parents, past pupils and the public to respond to the ongoing consultation, asserting that the outcome ldquowill have a lasting impact, not just in the school, with staff and pupils, but its ramications will be felt throughout the local community in East Down.The Board of Governors and school management say they do not believe the case has been made for the proposals as currently outlined and will be re-stating the reasons for this as part of the public consultation process and insist that they are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.De La Salle High School says the merger will ensure that families in the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority, while St Maryrsquos High insists that an all-ability school can cater for the gted and talented and also support children who need it.Mr Harvey said he was delighted to be able to secure the meeting with the education minister on behalf of St Patrickrsquos representatives and the ldquomany concerned parents who have contacted him on what he described as ldquothis important issue.He said has been working with them over recent days to ensure that their opposition to the current proposals is made clear to Department of Education officials.ldquoThese efforts culminated in last weekrsquos meeting with the education minister and served as a productive opportunity to enlighten him in respect of many of the key issues on the ground that, I believe, make the current amalgamation plans wholly unworkable, said Mr Harvey.ldquoThe plans, as proposed by CCMS, would reduce academic choice for parents and children from Downpatrick and the surrounding areas.ldquoIt would deny many Catholic schoolchildren the opportunity of attending a local selective Catholic grammar school and the proposed intake criteria would place children living in the rural areas beyond the urban Downpatrick area at a severe disadvantage in terms of the likelihood of being offered a place.Mr Harvey is also urging anyone who has views on the merger of the three Downpatrick schools to take part in the ongoing public consultation which closes on March

True to his word, he informed me right away, sayingPeter Scudamore could do it, so could he.The race saw  of the  entries go to post, with Frankie making the early running. With three fences to go, the leader was Dave Anthony, ridden by John Bright, with Brian Hamilton chasing on John Turleyrsquos Friendless Friend.Anthony then crashed out and Hamilton was unseated from Fearless Friend, leaving Frankie on Killinick Robyn to win from Darragh Cross owner Judith OrsquoGradyrsquos Another Partner, ridden by James Lamb, with Raymond Martinrsquos Kasperova and Paul Parkin third.The best horses that Frankie rode over the years were Jim Gloverrsquos Hopersquos Choice, trained by his father and namesake, Frankie Sr.Frankie Sr also owned and trained young Frankiersquos first winner under rules, Bright Trick, in a Hunterrsquos Chase at Downpatrick in .One of his most notable winners was Joe Rearsquos Palo. Trained by Peter McCreery, it was the result of a big gamble the day that Frankie rode it to success at Navan.His reward that day from Joe, renowned as Downpatrickrsquos ldquobusy draper, was a new suit.

Tim McGarry writes: \"It’s understandable the fans got a little exuberant winning the Scottish Premier League. But the Covid breaches were blatant.

Why  \"The News Letter’s legal adviser — Mr J Bryson of Donaghadee. Scroll down to find out moreWell because the royal family have shown themselves to be top-class, A list entertainers. They are like the Kardashians but with fewer booty shots and more ermine. Fair enough, unlike the Windsors, we don’t actually have to pay for the Kardashians, but let’s give credit where it is due.We’ve endured a year of non-stop Covid news and anxiety-inducing briefings by Robin Swann and Michael McBride. But this week the entire nation temporarily forgot about the C word as the royal family delivered revelations, allegations and retaliations. There was a jaw-dropping family psycho-drama, a high class celebrity spat. Who made who cry  Who said what to whom  There was a potential constitutional crisis and best of all there was the most passive-aggressive use ever of the phrase “some recollections may y”.I must admit I have found the whole thing hilarious and an unprecedented and hugely welcome ersion from grim reality. TV audiences were huge. Clips, jokes and memes abounded on social media. Newspaper salesincreased dramatically – though as an aside, hats off to the Irish News who relegated the royal story to page  below more important stories like ‘GAA player likes playing GAA’.Some serious issues were of course raised by all these majestic antics. So people took to Twitter. And there, they debated racism, the legal precedents for assigning imperial titles to babies and Oprah Winfrey’s hairdo. And the discussions had all the high-minded depth, intellectual rigour and kind consideration of alternative views that you would expect from a medium that permits a maximum of  characters per tweet. So I say we keep the royals. If only for the entertainment value. And let’s face itwe scrapped the royal family and instead had an elected president, Brexit Britain would probably make it a toss-up between Nigel Farage and Piers Morgan. And no nation deserves that.Amidst all the allegations of institutional discrimination one thing was overlooked. As a CatholicI am unable to become King. The Act of Settlement of  still bars Papists like me from ascending the throne. I’ll be honest, this blatant block on my career prospects hadn’t particularly troubled me before. Frankly the number of princesses throwing themselves at me has been slightly less than the number of Catholics celebrating Rangers winning the Scottish Premier League . But it’s the principle that counts. So after completing this column I will immediately be writing to Oprah to demand my two hour interview.• The PSNI have launched an ‘investigation’ in to alleged breaches of the Covid regulations by celebrating Rangers fans on the Shankill Road this week. In line with similar investigations, Operation Look at the News Footage, should take about  months to complete, by which time Celtic may well have reclaimed the SPL, making any subsequent convictions of Rangers fans doubly painful. Rangers winning the SPL is of course a once in a decade event, so it’s understandable that their fans got a little exuberant. I should make it clear that whilst I am a football fan myself, I genuinely do not follow and have no interest whatsoever in Scottish football. As Kevin Bridges famously said “Scottish football is a two horse race, and we’ve now lost a horse”. But as a football fan I get it. I get why the team I like doing better than team you like in an annual competition leads to unbridled ecstasy. But the Covid breaches were pretty blatant and indefensible.Thankfully my local team Cltonville have insisted on keeping their fans safe from this sort of thing by steadfastly refusing to win the Irish League. • This is the first column I have ever written for the News Letter and I was delighted to be asked by the world’s oldest daily newspaper to be a contributor. But this is Northern Ireland so when I told a few people about the column I was lambasted by a nationalist friend for ‘taking the soup’. He assumed that as an avowed unionist paper I would be subject to censorship. Nonsense. As I told my friend the editorial procedure is very simple. Basically I write my article. It is then sent to Ben Lowry to make sure there are no Irish words in it. Next it is passed on to the News Letter’s legal adviser — Mr J Bryson of Donaghadee — before final approval by the editorial committee, better known as the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland. It is a damning indictment of a ided Northern Ireland that my friend almost believed me.• Tim McGarry’s column will appear bi weekly in the News Letter on Thursdays from March ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

When asked by the News Letter why anyone should trust him when he misled the public about the Irish Sea border by denying there would be any checks, the Prime Minister did not address the question. However, he said that “we undertook to have some checks to prevent some goods from Northern Ireland going into Ireland” but he didn’t want “loads of checks” from GB to NI.Mr Johnson also claimed that he had supported the protocol “because it seemed to me to uphold the principles of the UK internal market” but admitted that there is now “an imbalance in the way the protocol is operating so as to affect the balance of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement”.Read More Read MoreBrandon Lewis interview: Denial of the Irish Sea border is gone as SoS says part...When askedhe could commit to the government not banning from Northern Ireland items such as sausages and soil, Mr Lewis said: “Look, that is absolutely what we want to focus on. I want to be really clear about our position: The great British banger – there are obviously some phenomenal Northern Irish sausages as well, but I want to make sure thatyou want to be able to go to your local shop and experience the Norfolkbanger or a Melton Mowbray pork pie or whatever it is, that you can do that that’s got to be the aim.“My position and the government’s position in terms of the grace period we’ve got for chilled meats at the moment is not that at the end of that grace period there is a clf edge it’s that we use the grace period to get a permanent solution to ensure that those products can continue to flow.”Last week the government announced a series of unilateral extensions to grace periods which delay parts of the Irish Sea border from being implemented. However, in that flurry of announcements it was largely missed that there was no end date associated to the reversal of what had been a total ban on British soil being imported, evena few particles were on a plant’s roots.One of the few people to notice that was former Ukip member Richard North, who wrote on his blog that the decision was dferent “in that it deliberately sets aside a provision on Union law listed in Annex  of the NI Protocol, which the UK government has agreed should apply to Northern Ireland”. Even though it was described as a “temporary operational measure”, and Downing Street had said it was part of “temporary, practical arrangements”, he highlighted that there was no end date.Last week’s guidance states: “Bulbs or vegetables that have been grown in soil can be sent from GB to NI eventhey still have soil attached.“Plants can be moved to NI with soil and other growing media attached, provided they are from an authorised business meeting GB plant passporting requirements for soil.”Other new red tape such as customs declarations remains.When askedthat decision was simply a grace period – delaying the inevitable – or was a permanent decision which will not be overturned, Mr Lewis said that the government had issued “a further guidance paper it’s not actually a grace period, so it sets out the arrangements for moving plants, vegetables, bulbs, machinery... they have soil attached.“But it’s not a grace period it’s a guidance piece so that is our guidance that is not a time-limited issue no.”When it was put to him that businesses such as plant nurseries need certainty that this is the law and it won’t be changing, he said: “Yes, and that’s why we’ve been able to issue the guidance on that. It still recognises the robust arrangements, so we don’t compromise biosecurity, etc, with the single epidemiological unit of the island of Ireland, but yes, that is our guidance, that is the position.“That point about certainty was also really behind the timing of the decisions last week because of what businesses were saying to us and confirmed after we took that decision that we had to do that to give them certainty for the weeks ahead, not just the months ahead.”:Sam McBride: Northern Ireland is now a proxy battleground for the EU and the UK – and that is dangerousTUV leader Jim Allister’s aide had messages between Jamie Bryson and Sinn Féin, court toldUnder cross-examination from loyalist Jamie Bryson, libel lawyer Paul Tweed refuses to name five Nama case clientsSam McBride: After darkness, light: Reasons for real hope as Northern Ireland vaccine rollout accelerates – but first expect political rowsBoris Johnson backs down as EU says no to demands to reduce Irish Sea border – and DUP says ask for more checks, not lessTwo thirds of GB retailers plan to stop selling to Northern Ireland by April because of Irish Sea border, survey findsUnionist leaders unite to go to court over Irish Sea border, arguing it breaches the  Act of Union and  Belfast AgreementSam McBride: Northern Ireland is in a breathtakingly undemocratic position which dishonest Boris Johnson knows is indefensible – yet he knowingly chose itSam McBride: Read the small print – the Irish Sea border may be impossible to remove, evenMLAs vote it downSam McBride: Shackled to Brexit, Arlene Foster can’t admit that it has been disastrous for Union – but Irish Sea border is radically reshaping NI——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But the encounter moved into territory which reveals something far more profound about this government’s thinking about the Northern Ireland Protocol which creates that internal UK trade frontier.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Just  hours after the new border began, Mr Lewis tweeted to say: “There is no ‘Irish Sea Border’”. Ever since, that tweet has hung like a millstone around Mr Lewis’s political neck.It was not a momentary slip. Rather, it was part of a strategy by him – on behalf of the government – to minimise the reality of the protocol.Perhaps reassured by the fact that Arlene Foster was in this period making clear that she had given up the political fight to prevent the creation of border control posts, the NIO had in October said on its official Twitter account in response to an article I had written: “There will be no border in the Irish Sea between GB  NI. The NI Protocol explicitly prevents the creation of one....”Alex Thomas from the Institute for Government later cited that tweet as an example of “increasing abuse of official communications”, and highlighted that government Twitter accounts “are funded by the taxpayer for the purpose of informing the public – not misleading them”.Given the scale of the new red tape – which is not yet being experienced in all its bureaucratic glory – I ask Mr Lewishe regrets what he said. It’s an obvious question, and Mr Lewis clearly has a prepared answer, saying that “it is a tweet that hasn’t stood the test of time as well as I would have hoped”.He frames it as somethingwhich essentially he believed at the time, with the government “looking to do the protocol in a way that consumersin Northern Ireland effectively wouldn’t see it, wouldn’t feel it, wouldn’t have an issue with it clearly that is not the lived experience on the ground and that is why we’ve taken measures over the last couple of months with the EU and obviously we took the measures unilaterally last week.”I ask himhe now believes that there is no Irish Sea border. He doesn’t answer, saying instead that “my focus is on getting to a position where consumers don’t have any impact in terms of having a dferential, in terms of the experience they have as a UK citizen in Northern Ireland as opposed tothey’re UK citizens anywhere , so that there is no real border at all – that’s got to be the aim”.Implicitly that accepts that there is now a border, but he goes on to say that his real aim is for Northern Ireland to “have a huge competitive advantage without any disadvantages, as an integral part of the UK”.Mr Lewis is mild-mannered, but there is an unmistakably bullish tone to many of his comments. He presents grace periods now not being for industry to adapt to bans and find alternative suppliers in the EU – as they once were presented –but for negotiating those bans out of existence.Whatthe EU says no  That hoary staple of ministerial answers – “I don’t like getting into hypotheticals” – is deployed, but he effectively does make clear that this is going to happen, eventhe EU objects, saying “We want to do this with the EU we want to find a way that works. With a bit of goodwill, we can work through that.“But ultimately, the Prime Minister has been clear – we want to ensure that the great Norfolk sausage or Melton Mowbray pork pie can be enjoyed anywhere in the UK, including Belfast.”Read More Read MoreBan on British soil entering Northern Ireland is over for good, says NI Secretar...He lampoons the EU thinking that chilled sausages need to be banned from Northern Ireland to protect their single market, saying “I personally don’t think that the great British banger is a greatthreat to the single market of the EU and I’m not sure that the risk of somebody smuggling a Norfolk sausage from Belfastto Dublin for sale is the biggest threat out there. So I’m cautiously optimistic we’ll get a mutually agreeable solution.”Butthe government doesn’t want the terms of the protocol to apply, why did it sign up to it Unconvincingly, he says: ”Well, one of the reasons there was a grace period was to get the permanent solution sorted out because it is complicated due to their single market issues and the phytosanitary check issues – we’ve got to use that to solve that problem permanently not as a clf-edge suddenly later in the year [where] you can’t source those products [form] wherever in the UK you want to.”The interview is suffused with the idea that the government thought the protocol would allow an unimpeded flow of GB goods into NI, despite the clear terms of what it agreed and its own assessments that there would not be an unimpeded flow.It is understandable why the EU is sceptical about this explanation, believing that Mr Johnson knew precisely what he was doing – and it was spelt out in detail to his negotiator, Lord Frost – during thelong talks.In the Commons on Wednesday, Mr Lewis said: “I am determined, as the Prime Minister is, to ensure that the great British banger...will continue to be enjoyed by those who wish to do so across the counties of Northern Ireland in perpetuity.”The words “determined” and “in perpetuity” seem to commit the government to permanently disregarding the EU’s ban on chilled meat products such as sausages and pies coming from GB to NI.When askedthe government was prepared to act unilaterallythe EU refuses to agree to that, Mr Lewis is vague, saying: “Our focus is on finding a solution that means they can be enjoyed in perpetuity. “We’re prepared to do that but George Eustice and the team at DEFRA are working with the EU on that, the Cabinet Office team lead on the protocol to get the solution to that. The Prime Minister has been clear – he wants that solution so that we find a way forward. I’ll not be drawn on what may or may not happen because I’m optimistic that we’ll get a mutually agreeable solution.”But we are clear: People in Northern Ireland are part of the United Kingdom they should be able to enjoy products from across the United Kingdom in the same way they wouldthey were living in Cardf, Edinburgh or Great Yarmouth.”It’s an answer which seems to logically commit the UK to unilaterally acting in multiple areas, regardless of what the EU thinks.There has been debate, and conflicting briefingfrom dferent parts of government, as to whether Boris Johnson is trying to radically renegotiate – even tear up – the protocol, or whether he is committed to fully implementing it.Mr Lewis frames the government’s unilateral move last week in line with the latter category – that it was necessary to act urgently to shore up support for the deal: “If we had not taken those actions last week, I think the protocol would be potentially fatally flawed in the next few weeks.”He says that “supermarkets and others were saying to me... that we would have had some empty shelves again in the next couple of weeks not in April – because of their lead times it would have come arguably next week maybe this week, but probably next week”.In that situation, he says that the News Letter and other media outlets “would, quite rightly, have been writing about it and showing images of that as another problem with the protocol”.Even some subsequent agreement with the EU to extend the grace periods would not have resolved the immediate problem, he says, “and that would have been an untenable position”.Mr Lewis says that he had told Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney that “ we hadn’t taken these actions last week, we’d have been in a really dficult position for the protocol – and actually, it’s in everybody’s interests, particularly actually I would say the Irish government and the EU...that we find a way to make sure the protocol works”.He said that the protocol “has to work for all communities – and at the minute it’s not really working for any because whether you’re nationalist or unionist or someone who doesn’thave a constitutional view, as a consumer you are affected by the protocol...there is obviously on top of that, and I recognise this, an issue for unionists who feel that there is an impact on identity and I get that, I absolutely get that.

Itrsquos quite unbelievable for a small town to have such a big connection, and I think it needs to be celebrated more.As lockdown hit last March, so did all of Incurzionrsquos events, which kept Mr King busy every week.He believes musicians have been ignored throughout the pandemic, which he worries may have caused a mental health crisis in the industry.ldquoAs live events go wersquove been absolutely decimated, he said. ldquoThe financial impact of that on venues and on companies like ours, as well as inidual musicians, has been unbelievable.ldquoBut fortunately for us our digital sales have been through the roof. That might be because people have more time on their hands at home to explore dferent genres, and itrsquos great they feel they want to purchase our music.ldquoBut the major thing for this industry is the live events, wersquore nothing without those, just like every other label and performer.ldquoThe funding has been awful, and the impact this will have on mental health seems largely ignored.ldquoThis is what we do every single week, and to have that stripped away from you for so long is dficult. Itrsquos also our place to network, so to not have that space will have long-term ramications.ldquoI know venues in Cardf that have had next to no support, andit carries on you canrsquot see how theyrsquod survive.With cases going down by the week, he hopes the music industry will be able to start up just in time for those venues and for musicians.ldquoWersquore obviously very eager to get back to le as it was, and to pick up where we left off.To find out more about Penarthrsquos Incurzion Audio, visit https:www.incurzionaudio Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
