Taking other data into account, it is unlikely Dfid saved that many lives through family planning interventions within such a short timescale.’In total, around 75 per cent of the mothers’ lives Dfid estimated that it had saved around the world were as a result of family planning interventions, such as contraception or abortions.Mad scientist: Brynne Edelsten’s ex jailed for cooking up a...African £112k \u0027Queen of Oxfam\u0027 is moving charity HQ from...Nurse who allegedly hurt her back trying to save a 126...Can it be true that crooked lawyers are helping asylum...Share this articleBut Icai questioned the modelling used, which, for example, did not take into account factors such as the age of the women.It added: ‘We find that the intensive focus on family planning, while valuable in its own right, has left the wider maternal health portfolio without a balanced approach across the different interventions that are needed to achieve significant reductions in maternal mortality over the medium to long term.’Dr Alison Evans, Icai’s chief commissioner, who led the review, said: ‘Every year, more than 300,000 women die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth and the majority of these deaths are in the poorest countries.‘The UK is clearly committed to improving maternal health, and Dfid has successfully expanded access to crucial services. However, given the ambition, need and level of investment, the programmes fell short of what was required to achieve adequate progress.’          Theresa May announced during the general election campaign last year that the Government would keep the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aidProjects funded by Dfid include a £109.9million scheme to improve basic health care, family planning and the skills of health workers in Malawi.Some £139million of British aid money was handed to Marie Stopes International to reduce maternal deaths from unwanted pregnancies by offering family planning services.Ministers have been under pressure to improve how the overseas aid budget is spent following Theresa May’s announcement during the general election campaign last year that the Government would keep the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid.Figures released earlier this year showed Britain is one of only seven countries around the world to meet the target.The UK foreign aid budget soared by £555million to a record £13.9billion last year. It has more than doubled from the £6.4billion spent in 2008 and more than quadrupled from the £3.3billion doled out in 2002. Britain has met the 0.7 per cent target every year since 2013.Dfid said last night that its estimates of lives saved were based on the best possible information available at the time.A spokesman said: ‘The UK is a global leader on supporting sexual and reproductive health and women’s rights and thanks to UK aid, millions more women now have access to contraception.‘We welcome Icai’s acknowledgement that UK aid is helping women around the world access the life-saving services they need, but it is disappointing the report has made some generalisations from a selected portion of our programming and also does not fully reflect the full impact of our work, especially in recent years.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/30/01/04DA6728000007D0-6331601-image-m-25_1540863813120.jpg","title":"Wash clothes sewing kit urges Womens Institute","story":"    The Women’s Institute is urging members to wash their clothes less frequently in an effort to reduce plastic pollution caused by microplastic fibres.

I think it is at best doubtful.Over the years, Charles has established close working and personal ties with royal Arab leaders. \u0027I was lucky to have known him\u0027: Prince William leads...\u0027Publicity-hungry\u0027 Prince Harry gazumped his father Charles...Share this articleHe is well respected in the Gulf States and Middle East, not least for his sympathetic speeches about Islam. Like Blair, he studied the Koran in depth and has even, over years, learned Arabic.When corresponding with Arab leaders he always signs his name in Arabic, another small nod to respecting the other culture. Indeed, he thinks Islam can teach us all a way of understanding and living in the world, which sadly, he believes, Christianity is poorer for having lost.Prince Charles believes that, by shackling Britain to the flawed Bush administration, Tony Blair missed a golden opportunity to forge an alternative consensus, one that both secured the crucial support of Arab leaders and embraced their unique perspective and understanding of the often troubled region.Privately, he castigated both President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Blair\u0027s combative role in Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 2003 military invasion of Iraq.          The prince was diametrically opposed to the Blair–Bush Iraq War strategy. He believed that, by shackling Britain to the flawed Bush administration, Tony Blair missed a golden opportunity to forge an alternative consensusHis views did not come with hindsight. Charles made his no-nonsense position clear to those in power at the time.He told political figures and those in his trusted circle that he regarded the Bush Administration as \u0027terrifying\u0027 and pilloried what he believes was Blair\u0027s lack of perspicacity. He believed Blair had behaved like Bush\u0027s \u0027poodle\u0027 and said so.One of his circle revealed: \u0027Whenever he followed in the wake of the Prime Minister on an overseas visit he would quote a phrase dryly, \u0027Thou shalt go behind the rear of the Lord to declare his song.\u0027 It would always get a laugh.\u0027Indeed, the Prince of Wales cast serious doubt on the government\u0027s 2002 intelligence dossier long before the BBC report in May 2003 that it had been \u0027sexed up\u0027.           Prince Charles told political figures and those in his trusted circle that he regarded the Bush Administration as \u0027terrifying\u0027As for George W. Bush, Charles believed the president \u0027lacked intelligence\u0027 and said Bush would always remain a \u0027mystery\u0027 to him.On Blair, the Prince was even more condemnatory. With a heavy dollop of irony, he scornfully dubbed the premier \u0027our magnificent leader\u0027 whenever talking about him in private and derided him for ignoring the wealth of sound intelligence available to him at the time that contradicted the American view.Charles repeatedly told friends that Blair should have listened to Arab leaders about how to act over Iraq.The Arab rulers had told him again and again how uneasy they were about Blair becoming so closely aligned with Bush and how \u0027bewildered and saddened\u0027 they were by the UK\u0027s position in being \u0027tied to the USA\u0027s coat-tails\u0027 over Iraq. Charles asked one high-level source damningly: \u0027Why did Mr Blair do it, despite what they must all have been telling him before the conflict about the dangers of stirring the hornets\u0027 nest up in this part of the world?\u0027          The Prince of Wales (pictured with sons William and Harry) repeatedly told friends that Blair should have listened to Arab leaders about how to act over Iraq\u0027The Prince,\u0027 one senior source and former member of the Royal Household said, \u0027had a very clear position on the West\u0027s so-called democratisation of Iraq and the region, based on years of study and conversations with leaders there.\u0027HRH did try very hard to engage senior figures on this, but nobody in government wanted to listen to a word he said. Their minds were made up.\u0027When given the opportunity, the Prince would point out why the delicate differences in culture in the region were crucial to understand. It was a region dominated by tribal loyalties, and still is. So marching in carrying a banner for Western-style democracy was both foolhardy and futile.One of the Prince\u0027s circle, who was fully aware of his views at the time, said: \u0027The Prince was wise enough to foresee that. Why weren\u0027t the politicians of the day?\u0027The 2003 invasion of Iraq lasted from March 20 to May 1. In the immediate aftermath of the war, Charles found the United States and United Kingdom government \u0027solutions\u0027 to be both naive and inept.The Prince privately questioned the legitimacy of so-called \u0027democratic elections\u0027 that followed when it was happening against a background of intimidation, violence and inter-tribal feuding.One impeccable source said: \u0027Around this time the Prince grew increasingly frustrated with the Iraq issue. It left him deeply depressed.\u0027 Another informed source told me: \u0027I remember one evening when the Boss was particularly animated on this subject.\u0027He was very critical of the Bush administration and the President in particular, saying that he felt our children\u0027s futures appear to be in the hands of what he described as an \u0027awful\u0027 administration and it absolutely terrified him. He just didn\u0027t trust them one bit.\u0027          According to sources, the Prince (pictured at Balmoral Castle) thought it was \u0027absolutely extraordinary\u0027 that neither the Americans nor those in authority in the UK ever seemed to listen to the Arab perspectiveThe Prince, according to sources, maintained it was \u0027absolutely extraordinary\u0027 that neither the Americans nor those in authority in the UK ever seemed to listen to the Arab perspective or consider their knowledge of Iraq and its religious and tribal complexities when seeking postwar solutions there.Ignoring their perspective, the Prince felt, was fatal and had led to what he described as \u0027the bewildering mess we are facing now at home and abroad\u0027.One former member of the Prince\u0027s household ulged that Charles was completely baffled by Bush and his stance in totally ignoring the advice of local leaders.\u0027The Prince could not understand the sense in America\u0027s position,\u0027 the source said, \u0027which was a need to revisit the \u0027crazy\u0027 de-Baathifican policy (sacking professionals who were members of Saddam Hussein\u0027s B\u0027aath party) that had led to the exclusion of so many badly needed professional people throughout Iraqi society and turned so many people against the coalition.\u0027Charles, the source said, was particularly derogatory about Bush\u0027s Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice — the first black woman to hold that post — and the extent of what he deemed U.S. ignorance of the Middle East. The Prince couldn\u0027t fathom why Ms Rice resisted all requests to visit the area.And some of her statements left him cold, such as: \u0027The people of the Middle East share the desire for freedom. We have an opportunity — and an obligation — to help them turn this desire into reality.\u0027\u0027But what does that actually mean and how on earth were they going to implement it?\u0027 he would question.In the Prince\u0027s view, the only way proper democracy will ever be achieved in Iraq, and the West will stand any chance of winning the war on terror is by dealing with the \u0027real toxin\u0027 infecting the whole world: the Israel– Palestine question.He maintains that the West must also focus on education and resisting what he believes is a \u0027terrible distortion\u0027 of Islam and how it is perceived.Only then, he believes —when the wider world embraces the real Islam, combined with a serious collaborative effort to find a workable solution to the Israel–Palestine question — will the rage that drives the war on terror start to wane.            Prince Charles and Princess Diana leave Gibraltar on the Royal Yacht Britannia for their honeymoon cruise in 1981. Prince Charles still keenly misses the royal yacht, which was decommissioned in 1997He pointed out that on his 2018 Australian tour he’d convened a round-table meeting with big-business CEOs to examine the challenges faced by the world’s ocean reefs. Yet senior representatives from Australia’s mining industry had failed to show up, and other industry leaders had sent more junior executives to represent them.Charles was clearly a little peeved, reflecting that this wouldn’t have happened if the meeting had been aboard Britannia. Whenever she was due in port, the British Ambassador — who advised on invitations — was suddenly the most popular person in the entire country, he said.

Taking other data into account, it is unlikely Dfid saved that many lives through family planning interventions within such a short timescale.’In total, around 75 per cent of the mothers’ lives Dfid estimated that it had saved around the world were as a result of family planning interventions, such as contraception or abortions.Mad scientist: Brynne Edelsten’s ex jailed for cooking up a...African £112k \u0027Queen of Oxfam\u0027 is moving charity HQ from...Nurse who allegedly hurt her back trying to save a 126...Can it be true that crooked lawyers are helping asylum...Share this articleBut Icai questioned the modelling used, which, for example, did not take into account factors such as the age of the women.It added: ‘We find that the intensive focus on family planning, while valuable in its own right, has left the wider maternal health portfolio without a balanced approach across the different interventions that are needed to achieve significant reductions in maternal mortality over the medium to long term.’Dr Alison Evans, Icai’s chief commissioner, who led the review, said: ‘Every year, more than 300,000 women die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth and the majority of these deaths are in the poorest countries.‘The UK is clearly committed to improving maternal health, and Dfid has successfully expanded access to crucial services. However, given the ambition, need and level of investment, the programmes fell short of what was required to achieve adequate progress.’          Theresa May announced during the general election campaign last year that the Government would keep the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aidProjects funded by Dfid include a £109.9million scheme to improve basic health care, family planning and the skills of health workers in Malawi.Some £139million of British aid money was handed to Marie Stopes International to reduce maternal deaths from unwanted pregnancies by offering family planning services.Ministers have been under pressure to improve how the overseas aid budget is spent following Theresa May’s announcement during the general election campaign last year that the Government would keep the controversial target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid.Figures released earlier this year showed Britain is one of only seven countries around the world to meet the target.The UK foreign aid budget soared by £555million to a record £13.9billion last year. It has more than doubled from the £6.4billion spent in 2008 and more than quadrupled from the £3.3billion doled out in 2002. Britain has met the 0.7 per cent target every year since 2013.Dfid said last night that its estimates of lives saved were based on the best possible information available at the time.A spokesman said: ‘The UK is a global leader on supporting sexual and reproductive health and women’s rights and thanks to UK aid, millions more women now have access to contraception.‘We welcome Icai’s acknowledgement that UK aid is helping women around the world access the life-saving services they need, but it is disappointing the report has made some generalisations from a selected portion of our programming and also does not fully reflect the full impact of our work, especially in recent years.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/30/01/04DA6728000007D0-6331601-image-m-25_1540863813120.jpg","title":"Wash clothes sewing kit urges Womens Institute","story":"    The Women’s Institute is urging members to wash their clothes less frequently in an effort to reduce plastic pollution caused by microplastic fibres.

Thank you for bringing such a genuine interest and focus on issues like mental health.\u0027The couple watched an energetic performance from dancers SaintzUp and singers Tone6, with Harry nodding his head and tapping his foot as he got into the Polynesian rhythm.As they gave the performers a rapturous round of applause, young people aged 17-25 were arranged into small groups so they could come and mingle.The Duke told them: \u0027You guys are amazing\u0027, while Meghan asked: \u0027What issues are you working on?\u0027Hearing about their concerns about the environment, ersity and mental health, the duke, who is now a commonwealth youth ambassador, told them he hoped to \u0027make people more aware of some of the issues that matter to you guys\u0027.Encouraging them to continue speaking out for their generation, he said: \u0027This energy, this connectivity, it\u0027s all here in you.\u0027The duchess listened closely to a group from charity Inspiring Stories, as young women spoke to her about empowering indigenous minorities, getting young people involved in politics, and mental health.

They unveiled a plaque recognising the dedication to the QCC, which conserves indigenous forests for future generations, before planting trees at the site.But it was the Wellington boot throwing contest involving local schoolchildren which proved to be a hit with the crowds who turned out for the royal visit. Meghan\u0027s team emerged victorious, with the Duchess proving quite the natural in the unusual contest, given it was most likely her first time partaking in such a sport.She had swapped a stylish navy blue blazer for a black hooded zip-up jacket with a QEII National Trust logo for the occasion - the same jacket her husband wore.           Schoolchildren surrounded the Royal couple clad in rain jackets and black caps as Meghan and Harry appeared to happily share a conversation and perhaps some \u0027welly-wanging\u0027 tips          Meghan happily posed for photos with the young students who were delighted to be in the presence of royalty          The royal couple had changed into wet weather jackets for the \u0027welly-wanging\u0027 contest after Meghan earlier wore a blazer and Harry, a coat          Meghan covered her mouth to cover a shocked expression while a man appeared amused as he held an umbrella above her head          Harry on the other hand appeared rather glum as he held an umbrella above himself and a man seated at his side          The Duke of Sussex pressed his forehead and nose up against another man for the traditional \u0027Hongi\u0027 greeting          The Duchess of Sussex waved to the crowd as she left the Dedication to the Queens Commonwealth Canopy, bound for her next engagement of the day The $219 (£120US$155) Wellington boots worn by the couple are from The Original Muck Boot Company.Meghan pressed her forehead and nose up against another woman for the traditional \u0027Hongi\u0027 greeting while shaking her hand at a ceremony to dedicate the area of native bush to the Queen\u0027s Commonwealth Canopy.Harry also embraced the woman\u0027s hand and gave her a similarly intimate Hongi hello at the ceremony.  EXCLUSIVE: Meghan Markle \u0027demanded\u0027 her first husband sign a...Meghan\u0027s short change!

relevant.But despite his efforts to ersify by baking pies, curing meats and making ready meals, gradually rising business rates have threatened to push Hayman\u0027s Butchers off the high street.Although they do not have to pay rent on the building in Sidmouth, Devon, because his grandfather bought it outright in 1907, his business rates are £12,000 a year.Mr Hayman said: \u0027There\u0027s no doubt about it, business rates have continued to creep up. The trouble is you\u0027ve got to cope.         Fare deal: Butcher Stewart Hayman, from Devon, is pictured with his award-winning pies on Church Street in Sidmouth \u0027In the last 12 to 14 months our trade has also dropped back at the same time.

One African American artist, Betye Saar, answered. She created an artwork from a “mammy” doll and armed it with a rifle.“It’s about keeping everything clean, keeping politics clean, keeping your life clean, your actions clean,” said Wendy NE Ikemoto, the society’s associate curator of American art. “She wants America to clean up its act and a lot of her art has to do with this idea that we haven’t cleaned up our act.”Saar, 92, was born in Los Angeles and turned to making political art after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. “After his assassination in 1968, her work became explicitly political,” said Ikemoto. “That’s when she started collecting these racist, Jim Crow figurines and incorporated them in her assemblages.”Saar was part of the black arts movement, the cultural – often literary – arm of the black power movement of the 1960s and 1970s she was also among so-called second wave feminists. But she still found herself at a crossroads. “The black arts movement was male-dominated and the feminist movement was white-dominated,” Ikemoto said. “Being at the intersection of both movements, she became one of the most prominent black female artists for presenting strong, recognized women who are fighting off the legacy of slavery. I think it did open doors for other artists to follow.”This traveling exhibit, from the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles, shows Saar’s consistent message through her washboard series. “Many of her works tackle broad issue of revisioning derogatory stereotypes to agents of change, historical change and power,” said Ikemoto. “Many artworks feature descendants of Aunt Jemima and mammy figures armed to face racist histories of our nation.”The exhibit includes Extreme Times Call for Extreme Heroines, a washboard piece Saar made in 2017 that features a mammy doll holding a pair of guns. The washboards are used in lieu of canvases and are loaded with symbolism.“The washboard becomes her frame for the art, it’s the star,” said Ikemoto. “It’s the structure of black labor and she is moving it from a space of invisibility to highlight it. She is also using this humble object of hard labor to subvert notions of fine art.”Each washboard is like a puzzle to be decoded, filled with small details that reference American history. There are Black Panther fists, references to police brutality and phrases from the Harlem renaissance poet Langston Hughes.There are also references to Memphis, the city where King was assassinated, and to the Congolese slaves who were killed under the Congo Free State. Some washboards include phrases such as “national racism”.“It’s interesting how racism is so entrenched in our nation, it has become a national brand,” said Ikemoto. “She takes something that is a sign of oppression and violence, something pejorative and derogatory, and transforms it into something revolutionary.”Not all of the artworks are on washboards, however. One piece from 1997, We Was Mostly ’Bout Survival, is on an ironing board, emblazoned with an image of a British slave ship.“I think this exhibition is essential right now,” said Ikemoto. “I hope it encourages dialogue about history and our nation today, the racial relations and problems we still need to confront in the 21st century.”All of Saar’s artworks are made with recycled materials, often found in secondhand shops. “Assemblage is about using recycled materials, found objects from the past,” said Ikemoto. “Just by recycling assemblages, her work is suggesting we haven’t gotten over these histories. The slavery of Jim Crow still holds currency today. The idea is that with each cycle of history, the world gets a little bit cleaner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538b6c45a1a764c6dd252583e2c272980bbe8417/0_522_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ede4f2cd3f24602d3a5f048f02e7b202","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Halloween approaches and tiojo has been doing some appropriate reading:I’ve just put down Andrew Michael Hurley’s second novel based in the countryside of the Bowland Fells and the Fylde, Devil’s Day. It follows on well from his first, The Loney. The countryside, which I know well enough, inspires him. But he sees things in it not many of us would. What to us are rolling moors, green valleys, sparkling streams, picturesque farmsteads, signify something else to Mr Hurley. He sees another world. Spiritual, demonic, folkloric, who knows. An unsettling mixture of real and imagined geography gives us the horror version of Le Grande Meaulnes. His novels are psychogeography in action. The moors will look different next time I walk across them.On the same theme, Veufveuve has enjoyed Mary Shelley’s Transformation:A slim collection of short stories (comprising the title story, The Mortal Immortal, and The Evil Eye). All three stories are in some way supernatural or uncanny and the writing, though obviously touched by the gothic and thus sometimes a little overblown, is often very good – she knew what she was doing. All three stories, like Frankenstein, explore what it means to be human and how we might live. For me, by the far the most effective was The Mortal Immortal (I probably don’t need to explain the subject matter), bringing home its great existential crisis very powerfully.A different kind of monster has entertained Kevin Dawson in Craig Brown’s Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret:That rare thing, a genuinely unputdownablelaugh out loud book. Difficult to tell who was the less appealing, Princess Margaret herself or the people who (as Brown notes) happily accepted invites to events at which she would be present, knowing how awful it (and she) would be. They attended seemingly only so they could then skip off home to describe how awful the event was. Increased my respect for George Harrison, though (who, on being told he couldn’t eat before she left a “do” simply went up to her and asked her to leave).This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson has impressed 17Luftballons:It’s about the captain of the Beagle and Darwin. Echoes of Patrick O’Brian’s naval novels but it’s the detail and description that really bring it to life, so vivid and well-described I almost feel like I’m watching a film, or that I’ve visited all these places I’ve never seen. The characters are fascinatingly nuanced and human. And their debates over theology versus their scientific discoveries are really bringing home to me the significance and impact of evolutionary theory at the time. Nice and long, too - I don’t want it to end any time soon!A forensic and very readable analysis of The Iliad and the different strands that informed its creation. Utterly fascinating and totally recommended for armchair Homer fans and general readers alike.Here’s a teaser from casaleiro:About 10 days ago the  carried an interview with a Spanish writer who recommended A High Wind in Jamaica by Richard Hughes. Never heard of it! So down the town I went and found a copy in a charity shop. It was a fabulous discovery, and I am currently following it by re-reading William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. What the two have in common is their view of childhood as a wild and potentially violent state of being. I guess most readers are familiar with Golding. Concerning the older novel by Hughes (1929), I will say nothing, I simply urge people to read it, preferably without knowing anything about it beforehand.I’m intrigued. Talking of suspense, franhunny has been reading Agatha Christie’s Mrs McGinty’s Dead:While I usually loathe Poirot because of his smugness, it was not as bad as in other Poirot novels so I could live with it as a quirk.Which made the book quite enjoyable. Oh, I knew the murderer after the second murder, but I did not know why yet and how the two murders were connected.A classic whodunnit, with the classic “all suspects into the same room” finale where Mr Poirot explains his thoughts.A few hours well spent.(I’m glad it felt like a good investment of time, because we’re going to be looking at Agatha Christie on the reading group next month.)Finally, Tropic of Capricorn by Henry Miller has done the trick for judgeDAmNationIII:I’m about halfway through rereading and my God is it the tonic I need at the moment. I remember being relatively unimpressed with it the first time around (at least compared to the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy and Black Spring, which I read first), and although there are parts that go on a bit, the rest of it just feels like it’s screaming directly into my soul.That sounds pretty good to me.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

They form the album of shared memories that defines each generation.On the November morning in 1990 when Margaret Thatcher resigned, I was at school. I can picture the very classroom. The teacher took the unprecedented step of wheeling in a TV so we could watch the Iron Lady’s momentous departure from Downing Street. I had no notion of what it was like to have a different prime minister. French friends say it was the same for them when François Mitterrand stood down in 1995, after 14 years in the Elysée palace. It took a while to get used to hearing the words “monsieur le president” in reference to a different face.And so there will be a generation of Germans who struggle to get their heads around the idea of politics without Angela Merkel. They don’t have to adjust overnight. Merkel has signalled that she will not seek re-election as leader of her Christian Democratic Union party – a role she has occupied since 2000. She has been chancellor since 2005 and can carry on in that post, but yesterday’s declaration effects a status shift from leader to caretaker. Merkel’s domestic position has been shaky since elections last year forced her into an unstable coalition with a debilitated Social Democratic party. That partnership elevated the far-right Alternative für Deutschland to the status of principal opposition party by default. Subsequent regional ballots have reinforced the sense of malaise in Germany’s political centre, as voters migrate towards the fringe. A poll in Hesse over the weekend was won by the CDU, but the party’s share dropped by more than 11 points. The SPD also shed support, while the Greens and AfD made significant gains.Germany is moving on from the Merkel era. The transition will be drawn out, but the confirmation is still a flashbulb moment across Europe. Length of service is only part of the story. Merkel has seen world leaders come and go. Tony Blair was her first British counterpart. She indulged David Cameron as the “naughty nephew” of whom she tried to make a responsible European. She warned him against trying to placate Eurosceptic backbenchers, correctly predicting that they would never be satisfied. She was apparently unimpressed when Theresa May wasted their first bilateral encounter in 2016, giving nothing away, reciting lines from a prepared script.Merkel must have had occasion to wonder what on earth happened to Britain when a buffoon like Boris Johnson could become foreign secretary, and be replaced by Jeremy Hunt, a man who can glibly equate the EU and the USSR. Merkel’s childhood was spent in communist East Germany. She knows the difference between a union of free democracies and a prison state. Where, she must ask herself, did all the grown-ups go?Meanwhile, Britain’s liberal internationalists admired Merkel’s principled embrace of Syrian refugees and marvelled at history’s capacity for irony: placing the torch of tolerance and good global governance in the hands of a German chancellor for safekeeping, and having her stand as cultural foil to a racist, demagogic ruler of the United States.There is some simplistic mythologising in the admiration of Merkel as the anti-Trump figurehead for European civilisation. (Open-border generosity hasn’t done her much good in domestic politics). But the very existence of that hagiography expresses a powerful craving for stability, maturity and dignity in global affairs. The victory in Brazil’s presidential election of Jair Bolsonaro – an aggressive far-right authoritarian – tilts the global balance another few degrees against the rule of law and towards a doctrine of swaggering, might-is-right machismo. It might be coincidence that Bolsonaro enters on one side of the stage just as Merkel prepares her exit, but that doesn’t make the contrast less poignant.In Britain, these developments were submerged in coverage of the budget, although in years to come no one will be swapping stories of where they were the day Philip Hammond delivered his 2018 fiscal set-piece. The whole show is meaningless without clarity about the UK’s relationship with the rest of Europe. The chancellor pretended to know the trajectory of the economy despite not knowing the future terms of trade with Britain’s closest neighbours. The Labour party pretended to have better ideas, because that is what the opposition does on budget day. But Jeremy Corbyn cannot describe his preferred arrangement of relations with the EU, or indeed the rest of the world, in terms any more convincing than May.The prime minister’s ambition has shrivelled to the hope that parliament can be intimidated into agreeing to whatever second-rate Brexit plan she can eke out of Brussels, for fear that something worse would emerge from the chaos of its rejection. The Labour leader’s strategy is to provoke that chaos in the hope that, somehow, power changes hands in the subsequent melee.While this pantomime plays out, Britain is not a serious or even a capable actor on the global stage. It is a case study in political dysfunction, a circus to make populists and tyrants glad and an item on the list that makes responsible politicians in Europe and the US fret about the health of liberal democracy. That anxiety is stoked by the prospect of Merkel’s departure, even if it has felt inevitable for a while.In volatile times she has served as the ambassador from a more stable era, recent enough that it feels still comforting. When she goes, that era is formally committed to memory, consigned to the past, and there opens up a terrible vacancy. It is a shaming fact that Britain is in no condition to supply a candidate to fill it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea0e55f1527972233dd2f0e55389326dbdbe1ed/172_236_573_344/master/573.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa2b478daeb63c0886aea0abc7ec29f9","title":"my childhood home in ipswich is now a verruca clinic this seems fitting","story":"All I ever wanted to do was leave my hometown.

Around 80 people a year are nominated and about 12 plaques are put up.“The bar is high, we are absolutely not wanting to hand out plaques to anyone. This is a serious thing about recording people who have made a significant contribution and there will be people who do not get through,” she said.The London blue plaques scheme was founded in 1866, with the first one unveiled at the birthplace of Lord Byron.It took 10 years for a woman to be recognised with a plaque when one was placed on the home of the stage actor Sarah Siddons. By 1905 only five women had plaques dedicated to them, including George Eliot.By 1986, when English Heritage took over the scheme from the Greater London Council, there were 45 plaques celebrating women.English Heritage said it had made some progress in recent years, unveiling another 80 London blue plaques dedicated to women. They include the computing pioneer Ada Lovelace, the DNA scientist Rosalind Franklin and the first woman to sit in parliament, Nancy Astor.More recent recipients include the cookery writer Elizabeth David, whose books such as A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950) and French Provincial Cooking (1960) transformed making meals from a matter of necessity to one of pleasure.Another is Agnes Arber, a botanist who published more than 90 scientific papers and eight books, including Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution (1912). A blue plaque will be erected at her home in Primrose Hill on Thursday.Three more blue plaques for prominent women are in the pipeline, English Heritage said. The women are:• The actor and Upper Norwood resident Margaret Lockwood (1916-90), one of Britain’s most popular film stars in the 1930s and 40s, whose many film roles include a bored heiress in Alfred Hitchcock’s The Lady Vanishes (1938) and the unfulfilled aristrocrat and highway robber Lady Barbara Skelton in the Gainsborough melodrama The Wicked Lady (1945).• The world war two spy Noor Inayat Khan (1914-44) who served with the Special Operations Executive and was the first female radio operator sent into Nazi-occupied France. She was captured and executed by the Gestapo in 1944. Khan was posthumously awarded the George Cross for her bravery in 1949. English Heritage said it was currently trying to find the best location for a plaque.• The traveller, archaeologist, mountaineer and diplomat Gertrude Bell (1868-1926), who played an important role in the establishment of the state known as Mesopotamia, now Iraq, after the first world war. Among her many eye-catching achievements and exploits was surviving 53 hours on a rope during a blizzard on the previously unclimbed north-east face of the Finsteraarhorn in the Swiss Alps in 1902. She was portrayed by Nicole Kidman in the 2015 Werner Herzog flop, Queen of the Desert.English Heritage said plaques for the writer Daphne du Maurier and the Bloomsbury Group artist Vanessa Bell were likely to follow but more nominations were needed, especially in the areas of science, sport and the fine arts, where women are particularly poorly represented.

Young people choosing to go to university had no choice: for the vast majority it was huge debt or no degree.These fees turn education into a cheap and nasty marketplace where universities that lie about their product can succeed. The supposed benefits of markets do not apply to higher education: students and their parents are not repeat consumers they don’t know what they are buying, while universities know very well how to tart up what they’re selling. Some institutions have become more focused on marketing, thanks to the financial incentive, than on providing a good education.Labour has said it would end tuition fees from the moment it is elected, and return our universities into institutions acting for the public good, not bodies that maximise profit. However, the party as yet has no policy on what to do about outstanding student loans – how to soften the injustice for students who have already racked up debt. University officials estimate that ending tuition fees and bringing back some maintenance grants would cost £10bn a year. And then there is the historic debt.Labour has been struggling to find a way forward. It cannot go into an election telling young people that if they are unlucky enough to have started university the day before a Labour government is elected, they will still have to pay off a £30,000 loan, just to cover their fees. It would not be fair on students, and would offer an incentive for them to defer entry until after a general election, leading to a sudden fall in fee income for universities, empty lecture theatres and probably redundancies in higher education.The solution, though, could be fairly simple: Labour could introduce a cap on maximum future student loan repayments for first-time undergraduate degrees, with the rest of the debts written off. The principles would be as follows. First, no student who started their course in 2012 should repay more than a student who started the same course in 2011 (when fees were a little over £3,000 a year). With interest added, that puts the debt cap for a student who started in 2012 at £12,000 (instead of anything from £30,000 upwards).Second, no student who starts their course in the year immediately before the new government is elected should pay more than one starting the same course the year after. In other words, they should pay tuition fees with a loan, but for them that loan would to be written off entirely if Labour won.Third, between 2012 and the year of a Labour election win, the maximum repayable loan should reduce fairly, as shown in the table. For those who have paid their fees up front there is no refund.If Labour wins in 2022, those who entered university in 2017 (midway between 2012 and 2022) should only have to pay back half of the maximum that any student who entered in 2011 would have to pay.The plan could be called “Jubilee 2022” – in recognition of the final year in which the cap would be implemented, exactly 10 years after exorbitant fees were introduced. If Labour is elected before 2022, the cap could begin to operate sooner.This model is fair and easy to implement. And it’s fair to those who do not go to university. The current system assumes graduates will be paid much more than non-graduates and can afford to repay vast loans. This embeds the toxic graduatenon-graduate differential, which is partly responsible for the UK’s dismal record on apprenticeships and technical education in comparison to its mainland European neighbours.How will we pay for this? The answer is another question: if the rest of Europe can do it, why can’t we? Across mainland Europe, including at all the best universities, tuition fees are either much lower or non-existent. We could raise taxes on wealth, on corporations and on people receiving the highest incomes to the levels of the rest of western Europe. Because higher education is an investment in the productivity of the economy, we should fund it through state, not inidual, borrowing.This plan would not cost as much as some might imagine because – as has become increasingly clear – many, if not the majority of graduates will be unable to pay back their loans. Some, such as medical students, even have an incentive to leave Britain – and their huge debts – never to return.At present government is paying most of the fees, but pretends it is not through an opaque relationship with the Student Loans Company and the fiction that future graduates will be as well paid as those in the past, when being a graduate was far less common. Implementing this idea moves the funding model away from the fantasy of putting things off the balance sheet.The key is that we transform a set of onerous private debts into a social obligation borne by the government – by us all collectively. This is a progressive way to fund higher education and a recognition of its status as a public good. Danny Dorling is Halford Mackinder professor of human geography at Oxford University.

It shows them a pathway into writing their own stories.”Kinney’s mother was an early childhood educator and he comes from a family of teachers. He says of current trends in education: “I understand the need to hold teachers and schools accountable, but I wish there wasn’t such emphasis on testing these days and that teachers could be more creative.“The arts were such an important part of my schooling. For a lot of kids, art and music saved them. I think a school without the arts is not addressing that needs of all its students.”Kinney’s 13th book in the series, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Meltdown, is published on 30 October, furthering the adventures of his hugely successful character Greg Heffley. “Greg is a kid who’s not living up to his potential,” Kinney says. “He’s bright but a bit lazy, and a lot of kids can relate to that.”A former newspaper cartoonist, Kinney’s speciality is to tell his stories with the help of funny illustrations. “As a student, I remember reading textbooks and thinking that if I could just get through the text to an image, I would be OK. The image was a reward, the image was a break. So in my books, that’s really what I’m trying to do – to keep stringing the reader along with these little rewards.”He sees the illustrations as propelling the plot forward. They are “like having candy with your vegetables”, offering a bridge between picture books and books with chapters and no illustrations.“Lush picture books with beautiful illustrations send a message that reading is fun and books are good things. But once children are reading, we hand them dense chapter books without pictures. I think sometimes kids look at these books and say, ‘maybe I don’t like reading after all’.” Research last year by the National Literacy Trust showed that by the age of 14, children who enjoy reading have a reading age 3.3 years ahead of their peers who don’t enjoy it. Further research by the trust, published last month, revealed that children with above-average reading skills are three times more likely to have good mental wellbeing than those with reading skills below the level expected for their age.“Books uniquely teach empathy because they allow the reader to see life from a different point of view,” says Kinney. “This is a time, especially in the US, when empathy is in short supply, so I really hope I’m doing my job and turning kids into readers.”The success of his series, which has sold more than 200m copies worldwide and inspired four feature films, has taught him a lot about what children enjoy reading. “I keep hearing how important it is for kids to feel seen – and they can feel seen by an author, when an author recognises their situation and describes the way they feel.”Kinney tries not to underestimate how mature and sophisticated his eight- to 12-year-old readers can be, and avoids trying to teach children how to behave. “Kids can understand irony,” he says. His stories are deliberately subversive. “Kids like to read about somebody who is having it a little bit worse than they are. They feel like they are in on the joke.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0450c92d579493a5e97ac9ddc462179aa1c6f4cc/0_278_5226_3136/master/5226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4336ae43bf31dde292677cdf7d6dd5b","title":"60m greenery drive to plant 10m trees in england","story":"Conservationists say money is step in the right direction in tackling climate changeMore than 10m trees will be planted across England with the injection of £60m of new funding over five years, as part of what the government billed as its “drive to preserve the country’s greenery”.The bulk of the money, £50m, will pay landowners for planting trees that lock up carbon, which observers said raised questions over how accessible those woodlands would be to the public. That fund, the Woodland Carbon Guarantee scheme, should pay for 10m trees.The other £10m will be targeted at planting in cities and towns and should fund at least 100,000 more trees.The Woodland Trust, a conservation charity, said the money was a step in the right direction in terms of tackling climate change and wildlife losses, but not enough in total. “The problem is greater than just having the funds to deliver increased tree-planting,” said Abi Bunker, the group’s director of conservation.The government said it would also back a study into the possibility of creating a new “Great Thames Park” in the Thames estuary, which experts have said could be ready by 2020. Ministers have pledged to plant 11m trees between 2017 and 2022, approximately the same number that were planted under the five years of the coalition.England’s tree-planting record is poor compared with other European countries. About 1.6m trees were planted in England with government support in the 2017-18 financial year, covering 895 hectares. By comparison, Scotland planted 7,100 hectares in the same period.Conservationists have pointed out that because England’s 120m ash trees are threatened by ash dieback, a deadly fungus that arrived in 2012, the country is on track to suffer a net loss of trees over the next five years. The mix of species to be planted under the government’s new funding announcement will be decided at a later date."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38166628f8bdb58897b2bd2c7a746c4ba06b1813/0_285_5018_3012/master/5018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53d56baffc74aa4310a640ab20a3fb12","title":"humanity wiped out animals since 1970 major report finds","story":"The huge loss is a tragedy in itself but also threatens the survival of civilisation, say the world’s leading scientists The new estimate of the massacre of wildlife is made in a major report produced by WWF and involving 59 scientists from across the globe. It finds that the vast and growing consumption of food and resources by the global population is destroying the web of life, billions of years in the making, upon which human society ultimately depends for clean air, water and everything else.“This is far more than just being about losing the wonders of nature, desperately sad though that is,” he said. “This is actually now jeopardising the future of people. Nature is not a ‘nice to have’ – it is our life-support system.”“We are rapidly running out of time,” said Prof Johan Rockström, a global sustainability expert at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “Only by addressing both ecosystems and climate do we stand a chance of safeguarding a stable planet for humanity’s future on Earth.”Wildlife and the ecosystems are vital to human life, said Prof Bob Watson, one of the world’s most eminent environmental scientists and currently chair of an intergovernmental panel on bioersity that said in March that the destruction of nature is as dangerous as climate change.“Nature contributes to human wellbeing culturally and spiritually, as well as through the critical production of food, clean water, and energy, and through regulating the Earth’s climate, pollution, pollination and floods,” he said. “The Living Planet report clearly demonstrates that human activities are destroying nature at an unacceptable rate, threatening the wellbeing of current and future generations.”The biggest cause of wildlife losses is the destruction of natural habitats, much of it to create farmland. Three-quarters of all land on Earth is now significantly affected by human activities. Killing for food is the next biggest cause – 300 mammal species are being eaten into extinction – while the oceans are massively overfished, with more than half now being industrially fished.African elephants: With 55 being poached for ivory every day, more are being poached than are being born, meaning populations are plungingOrangutans: More than 100,000 were lost in Borneo alone between 1999 and 2015, largely due to forest destruction for timber and palm oil, leaving the great apes critically endangeredWhale sharks: Numbers of the largest fish have collapsed by two thirds in the last 75 years in the Indian and-Pacific Oceans, due to overfishing and ship collisions.Wandering albatross: Populations are declining rapidly, driven largely by accidental catches in long line fisheries. One monitored population on South Georgia fell by half between 1972 and 2010Jaguar: The razing of forests in South America is driving the decline of this big cat, which prefers to live in dense jungleGharials: There are now just 200 breeding adults of the fish-eating crocodile in the wild in India and Nepal, the result of rampant fishing, poaching and drops in river flow.Chinese giant salamander: This creature is one of 545 critically endangered amphibians, decimated by hunting for food, destruction of rivers and lakes and pollution.Hedgehog: This animal is among the fifth of UK mammals at high risk of extinction, with populations having fallen hugely in both urban and rural locations.Chemical pollution is also significant: half the world’s killer whale populations are now doomed to die from PCB contamination. Global trade introduces invasive species and disease, with amphibians decimated by a fungal disease thought to be spread by the pet trade.“It is a classic example of where the disappearance is the result of our own consumption, because the deforestation is being driven by ever expanding agriculture producing soy, which is being exported to countries including the UK to feed pigs and chickens,” he said. The UK itself has lost much of its wildlife, ranking 189th for bioersity loss out of 218 nations in 2016.The Living Planet Index has been criticised as being too broad a measure of wildlife losses and smoothing over crucial details. But all indicators, from extinction rates to intactness of ecosystems, show colossal losses. “They all tell you the same story,” said Barrett.But Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International, said the fundamental issue was consumption: “We can no longer ignore the impact of current unsustainable production models and wasteful lifestyles.”The world’s nations are working towards a crunch meeting of the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity in 2020, when new commitments for the protection of nature will be made. “We need a new global deal for nature and people and we have this narrow window of less than two years to get it,” said Barrett. “This really is the last chance. We have to get it right this time.”Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF, said: “We are the first generation to know we are destroying our planet and the last one that can do anything about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/662ce2118e6e3e07d4eb5156b6d4099a8ad5e11a/0_106_1425_854/master/1425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3773d0e4b9a248f65840049ba5c0aed3","title":"unfashionably fashionable the best of rankin in pictures","story":"A new book charts 30 years of the fashion photographer’s work.

Lopetegui was sacked by the Spanish Football Federation in June after the RFEFpresident, Luis Rubiales, claimed to have found out only five minutes before the appointment was made public and two days before the tournament began now he has been sacked by Madrid in the wake of their 5-1 hammering by Barcelona on Sunday.That defeat was Madrid’s third in a row in La Liga. The midfielder Casemiro called the team a “disaster” and described the defeat as the “image of our season”. Madrid had previously gone eight hours without scoring, 12 minutes short of their worst-ever run, and they have lost five and won only one of their past seven matches – an unconvincing 2-1 win against the Czech side Viktoria Plzen that ended with supporters whistling to show their dissatisfaction. Defeated in the European Super Cup on his competitive debut, Lopetegui has lost as many games as he has won in all competitions: six of 14.On Sunday Lopetegui insisted he had the “strength” to carry on but the decision was not his. Madrid are currently ninth in the table and the club released a statement on Monday evening confirming that they had unilaterally released the coach, who has now been sacked from the two biggest jobs in Spain in just four months. There was no press conference or appearance from the president to explain the decision.“The board understands that there is a great difference between the quality of the Real Madrid squad, that has eight players nominated for the Ballon d’Or, unprecedented in the history of the club, and the results achieved until now,” read the club statement. “We are grateful to Lopetegui and his staff and wish them the best in their professional career.”Santiago Solari, who manages Madrid’s B team Castilla, will take over on an interim basis, starting with Wednesday’s trip to face Melilla in the Copa del Rey.Madrid had briefed that they would bring the former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, whom they contacted over three weeks ago, but talks stalled on Monday. Although there is no definitive decision, there was little optimism that a deal would be done with the Italian. The reason for that is not yet clear but Madrid’s captain, Sergio Ramos, had made it clear that he did not welcome the prospect. Asked about the prospect of a manager like Conte with mano dura – an iron fist – arriving at the Bernabéu, Ramos replied: “Respect is earned, not imposed.”Although he did not name them, Ramos clearly referred to Vicente del Bosque, Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane, none of whom is authoritarian and who all had a close relationship with the squad, when he added: “We have had success with coaches that I don’t need to name but you all know. Sometimes knowing how to manage a dressing room is more important than technical ability.”Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, believes he needs a manager to lead a dressing room that has become too comfortable, but the prospect of conflict from the start is not one that Conte can have relished.One of the criticisms Pérez levelled at Lopetegui was that he was too indulgent of the squad and he rapidly lost faith in the coach – at least in part because he did not have much faith to start with. After Zidane announced his surprise resignation, Madrid sought to bring in a series of managers to take over, including Mauricio Pochettino and Max Allegri of Juventus, before eventually turning to Lopetegui in the face of extremely limited options. Few wanted to follow Zidane, winner of three Champions Leagues in a row. Some saw flaws in the squad, too – Zidane himself had warned of the need to make changes after a season in which, while they won the European Cup, they also finished third in La Liga, 17 points behind Barcelona.For Lopetegui the opportunity was one that he could not pass up – he did not think it would mean the chance to coach Spain at the World Cup would be denied him. He did not request that Madrid wait or that conversations be held with the Federation, whose president was furious when he was presented with a fait accompli.Lopetegui was unveiled at the Bernabéu the day after he had been sent home from Russia.“Yesterday the saddest day of my life today is the happiest,” he said. It would always be difficult to dissociate the two days: being Madrid manager was always likely to be tinged with some regret, even if he was successful. Although Madrid started the league season brightly and were impressive in their Champions League debut against Roma, results soon deserted them. Lopetegui lamented injuries and bad luck, but that excuse did not convince.He was careful not to publicly challenge decisions made at boardroom level but with Neymar the only player Madrid were prepared to spend big on and the market shifting, the squad has got weaker over the last three years. That morning, El Mundo published an interview with Lopetegui’s elderly father in which he complained “they have taken fifty goals off” his son, with the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo.Pérez was also unhappy that there was no place for 18-year-old Brazilian signing Vinicius, who Lopetegui left in the B team. The club’s legal staff managed to get a ban overturned following a red card playing for Castilla last weekend, freeing Vinicius to play the clásico on Sunday. He travelled with the team, missing the Castilla game, but Lopetegui left him out of the matchday squad.The manager’s position had already become all-but untenable. The clásico might have been an opportunity to avoid the inevitable, and some players expressed their support, but Madrid were defeated 5-1 and slipped seven points behind their rivals. “I know how football is,” he said afterwards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/237222955e36386ff1c9002f1411e08e26316f69/0_100_1905_1143/master/1905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1bf716c0e3ffc2f0f98f293093429f5","title":"raheem sterling nfl wembley manchester city","story":"The pitch looked terrible and the match was patchy but the Manchester City forward showed what a top performer he isRaheem Sterling spent a fair amount of his childhood dodging potholes and wrong‑footing passers-by as he kicked a ball around Wembley. So no real change there on a strange night when Manchester City eked out a brittle, angsty 1-0 win against a brittle, angsty Tottenham team in front of a brittle, angsty Tottenham crowd.It is hard to think of many stranger Premier League fixtures than this, though this 1-0 victory for the champions was strange in an understated, slightly dreamy kind of way. For most of the first half it was almost impossible to look past the wretched spectacle of the Wembley pitch, heavily scarred by the markings of the NFL game on Sunday night and appearing here like a jilted bride in its faded Super Bowl suit, still mourning that scuppered elopement with the man from the Jacksonville Jaguars.The ground staff at Wembley should be applauded for their hard work in remedying this. To their credit the pitch played well. But it looked terrible. The Wembley centre circle was still home to a mockingly semi-erased NFL badge. The yard-markers from 50 to 10 were confusingly visible. On the near side a brown trench ran the length of the pitch with the word LONDON emblazoned in green relief, like the logo on the hem of a cheap pair of pants. Otherwise the surface looked drawn and haggard, a pitch still coming down from the night before the night before, with lines and cracks and stubbly patches peeking through.Perhaps unsurprisingly City and Spurs produced an odd, half‑and‑half performance. City never really looked like losing, even as they were cut open regularly on the left, Benjamin Mendy scampering up and down his flank like a startled kitten.City were also sublime in attack at times, the short-range combinations between David Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Bernardo Silva so soft and sinuous they should probably have been pixelated out in the name of decency or subject to a tactful cut away by the TV director.In the middle of all this it was Sterling who provided a note of hard-running certainty. It is still easy to underestimate what City’s most prosaic, no-frills attacker offers to this team of artists. It was Sterling’s direct running in the sixth minute that made the only goal, initiated by Ederson’s hard, flat forward pass.With the ball at his feet City’s keeper saw Sterling split left from the snap and sent the ball long. Kieran Trippier could only flick it on back towards his own goal. Sterling carried the play into his own favourite little hot spot by the intersection of six-yard box and touchline, then cut back for Riyad Mahrez, arriving late in the end zone, to ease the ball into an unguarded net.It was a wonderfully simple, well‑executed goal. But then Sterling is a hugely effective Premier League player now, reward for his own hard work with Pep Guardiola and for a clarity in his attacking intentions. He has become a pared back inside forward, operating in the same channels, with the same range of movements and with a brutal repetitiveness. It works. The assist for the goal was Sterling’s third of the season to go with four goals in eight league games.It was also a welcome element of certainty on a night when both teams looked spooked at times. The Mendy-Sissoko channel in particular was home to some slapstick moments. Look, there goes Mendy again, caught 40 yards upfield, haring back frantically like a man fleeing a pack of wild dogs. But wait, here’s Sissoko to punt the ball blindly out of play, each time looking utterly stunned, as though only then rediscovering that, yes, he really is still Moussa Sissoko.It was further forward on City’s flanks that the best football of the game was played. Mahrez always seemed to be free, jinking always to his left, a jink so well advertised one half expected it to pop up on the scrolling boards at the side of the pitch in shiny flashing text, but which somehow nobody ever really seems to expect.With Sterling on the other side City always carried a threat, even on a night that will be remembered more for the oddity of its staging. At the end there was a reassuringly warm quality to the cheers from the City fans, and an unusual energy to the backslaps among Guardiola’s staff. City have now travelled to Arsenal, Liverpool and Spurs, keeping three clean sheets and taking seven points. They were lucky not to concede, rescued by Ederson in the first half, and by Erik Lamela’s ham-footed finish in the second. But this was just a game to win, a strange night on a weird pitch, decided by a moment of prosaic incision from City’s own local boy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dceff5a99da4f63b8d881adb13c5bab28742defb/205_412_2647_1588/master/2647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f43ee73ef8d5ff47a434c1413486246","title":"five scenic uk cycle routes for beginners","story":"Cycling doesn’t have to be all about endurance, speed and derring-do – it’s also an activity that can be relaxing and even meditative. These five routes are perfect for those looking to take on longer rides at a gentler paceMore and more people are rediscovering cycling as a gentle way to exercise and explore new places on their own steam. Cycling lets us experience our surroundings in new ways – from the sights and smells we might miss in the car, to the simple pleasure of feeling the wind in our hair. It’s also something just about anyone can enjoy: cycling is non-weight bearing, and for many people it’s easier than walking. There are also bikes to suit most needs. With some great, flat, traffic-free or low-traffic routes across the UK that you can enjoy at a gentle pace, inspiration and adventure are just around the corner.Distance: 18 milesStart: PadstowEnd: Wenford BridgeTime taken to cycle: one-and-a-half to two hours without stopsThe Camel Trail is one of the UK’s best-loved cycle trails, not least with families, for its beautiful waterside scenery and wealth of wildlife. From picturesque Padstow it follows the Camel estuary’s shore, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and home to little egrets, peregrines, ospreys and kingfishers. The delightful riveted Little Petherick creek bridge once served the former railway line. After an on-road section through Wadebridge it wends through wooded country beside the River Camel, past Bodmin, before briefly skirting Bodmin Moor, to Wenford Bridge.Pit stopTreats on Trikes is a traditional tea, cake and ice cream vendor on a tricycle, midway between Padstow and Wadebridge, at Penquean quarry.Distance: 13 milesStart: Sirhowy valley country parkEnd: Taff Bargoed parkTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours without stopsExplore three south Wales valleys parks by bike. Starting at Sirhowy valley country park, north-west of Newport, you’ll follow a former railway line over the listed Hengoed viaduct, with its 16 towering arches, and past the Wheel o Drams, an 8-metre tall circular sculpture of mining carts. Penallta country park once housed the deepest pit in the south Wales coalfields, and now features viewpoints, wetlands, and the UK’s largest earth sculpture – Sultan the Pit Pony (above, top left). You’ll finish in Taff Bargoed park, once three pits, and now a wildlife haven perfect for a riverside picnic.

No wonder the fitness world loves itIf you have an injury or health condition, consult your doctor before doing these exercisesIt doesn’t take much time to improve your health. HIIT has become a staple in the fitness world and for good reason: it’s the time-efficient, super-effective way to get fitter that’s backed by science.But it doesn’t always have to mean donning your lycra – in fact, research shows that as little as a minute of HIIT can benefit the body. The workouts below take two minutes each, one for each hour of your working day. They target every muscle group in the body, require no equipment and can be done in very little space.The benefits? You’ll boost your circulation and energy levels every hour, so no more wanting to sleep face down on your keyboard it will increase your cardio fitness, muscle strength and core stability, and you’ll continue to burn calories even after you’re back at your desk!Before doing each workout, warm up by gently jogging on the spot for 30 seconds and then standing and raising one knee at a time in front of you – 10 on each leg. Work as hard as you can for the 20-second bursts of exercise. At the end of the workout, pace around for 30 seconds to cool down and stretch out any muscles that feel tight.Each workout follows the same pattern: do the first three exercises for 20 seconds each, with 10 seconds of rest in between each one. Do the fourth exercise for 30 seconds:Plank Lie on your front, hands beneath your shoulders, elbows pointing back. Tuck your toes under and push yourself up until your arms are straight, pulling your navel up towards your spine so you feel the core stability muscles around your middle engage. Keep looking at the floor and make sure your bottom is neither sagging towards the floor nor pushing up towards the ceiling.Press-ups From a plank position, bend your elbows to lower yourself towards the floor. Letting your elbows flare out to the side works the chest harder keeping them nearer your sides focuses more on the triceps. A full-press up is touching your nose almost to the ground, but you may not get that far to start with. The most important thing is to keep a straight line from your knees, to hips, to head. Balance on your knees rather than your feet to make it easier if needed.Jumping jacksStand with feet together and hands by your sides. Simultaneously, jump your feet out sideways and swing your arms out to the side and up until your fingertips meet above your head. Jump back to starting position.Bottom kicksJog on the spot, flicking your heels up to kick your bottom.High kneesJog on the spot while bringing your knees up high in front of you. Use your arms to really drive the movement and go as fast as you can. If this is too vigorous for you, do the same action but as though you’re walking rather than running.Mountain climbersFrom a plank position, lift your right foot off the floor and drive the knee towards your chest. Place the foot back and repeat with your left knee. Don’t stick your bottom high in the air and keep a rapid flow.Shadow boxStand with feet hip-width apart and bring fists up into a boxing position. Punch upwards with the right hand then the left, then punch across your body with your right hand then left, allowing your body to rotate towards the direction of the punch and heel to come off the floor.Bear crawlKneel on all fours, hands directly under your shoulders, knees under your hips. Tuck your toes under and lift your knees to hover a few inches above the ground. Now crawl forwards – right arm at same time as left leg and vice versa – for six paces, then crawl backwards for six. Keep your abdominals engaged and back as flat as possible (imagine you’re balancing something on it).Reverse lungesStand with feet hip-width apart. Step back with your left foot, lowering the front knee to a right angle or deeper. Focus on using the glute in your right buttock to power back up to standing. Repeat with the right leg.Sumo squatsStand with feet wide apart, toes turned slightly out (about 45-degree angle), hands clasped in front of your chest. Keeping your back straight, bend your knees in the direction of your toes (but don’t go beyond them) to lower yourself until your knees are as near to 90 degrees as possible. Keep your weight in your heels. Come back to standing.Squats or jump squatsStand with feet just wider than hip-width apart. Cross your arms and place your hands on opposite shoulders. Keeping your torso upright and chest facing forward, bend your knees and stick your bottom out, spread your weight through your heels and ensure that your knees don’t stick out beyond the end of your toes. For a full squat, you’re aiming to lower your bottom to knee height while keeping your chest facing forward, but go as far as is comfortable. Return to standing. To make squats harder, add in a little jump at the top of the move.Bicycle crunchesLie on your back with feet flat on the floor, hands touching your ears, elbows out to the side. Simultaneously, lift your feet and head off the floor and begin to slowly move your legs in a pedalling motion. As your right knee comes towards you, bring your left elbow towards it and vice versa with the left knee and right elbow. Keep your torso still by engaging your core stability muscles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bde53bfab45f752f0423461a10de1c7b166975/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f40f06a7976a63d80404621f00899d","title":"nine simple ways to revamp your workspace for a healthier environment","story":"Improving your posture at work, adding some greenery to your desk and moving to a window seat are just some of the quick fixes that can transform your productivityThere’s a lot more to happiness in the workplace than a comfortable salary. In fact, working more than 40 hours a week may well be doing you a considerable disservice and directly affecting your health and performance at work. Thankfully, taking a few minutes of your day and deploying intelligent fixes can turn your office from a dreary workspace to an area that transforms your productivity and mindset. Here are nine ways you can make your office work for you.Take a standThere’s a reason standing desks – no longer the reserve of agile Silicon Roundabout startups – are quickly making their way into the offices of multinationals. Encouraging employees to be considerably more aware of their posture at work, adjustable desks and workstations such as Varidesk and the Yo-Yo desk are quickly becoming adopted by offices across the UK. What’s more, sitting for more than six hours a day leaves you at greater risk of anxiety and depression, according to the Association for Psychological Science – meaning that an eight-hour day spent on your rear quickly becomes an unhealthy habit.Spring cleaningOld meeting notes, dirty mugs, empty sandwich boxes and a dirty keyboard all add up to an unhappy desk. According to a study by Princeton Neuroscience Institute, “multiple visual stimuli” – also known as unwelcome desk clutter – compete for attention in your brain, meaning you can remove distraction with a desk free of unnecessary mess. Similarly, you’ll want to give your keyboard a wipe-down every week or so, as the average keyboard has 20,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.Stretch it outStressful experiences – at work and at home – have the potential to age the human brain by four years, according to a 2017 study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s conference. Thankfully, you can de-stress and fight poor posture at your desk by working through this stretching routine. To open up your back, bring your hands behind you and press your palms together. Bring your elbows back and downwards, slowly tucking your chin – hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat three times. Consider this your first step to become a more supple – and pain-free – human.Make a moveFor now, there are no stringent laws on taking screen breaks, but the Health and Safety Executive recommends a five- to 10-minute break every hour. Standing up and walking around will help stretch your body, adjust your posture and increase productivity and attention, as well as the quality of your work.Give yourself a handSpending 35-plus hours at a desk each week is hardly appealing, the very real prospect of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) – a condition in which a nerve in your wrist is under pressure, causing numb hands, weakness and tingling – is far worse. Common in men and women over 40 years old, CTS stems from repetitive actions such as using a mouse and keyboard. Handily, ergonomic office equipment – Microsoft Surface and Mac-friendly Kinesis Freestyle are two of the UK’s most popular options – can help stave CTS off. The oddly shaped equipment improves forearm posture, adds comfort and supports your hands. You’ll agree that it’ll be worth a few odd looks.Thirsty workWorkplace absence in the UK is costing £18bn annually, according to analysis from Centre of Economic and Business Research. That’s a total of 168m working days lost annually. While there’s no sole reason for this, it’s important to adopt everyday habits to keep you as healthy as possible in the workplace. Dehydration, for example, even at a mild level, directly affects both physical and mental performance, meaning that you’ll find it hard to concentrate during work hours and struggle with that post-work run. Women should aim for two litres a day, and men for three litres.Light workIf constantly feeling tired is making office life a miserable reality, it could be because of the light levels in your office. A 2013 study from the Netherlands found that when office workers were exposed to more daylight during the working week, they were less sleepy and considerably more energetic. Similarly, researchers from Turkey found that study participants who had three hours or more of daylight a day felt considerably happier and more satisfied – muting the chance of office burnout. Push for that window desk and reap the rewards immediately.Pain in the neckYour career, rather unfortunately, is wreaking havoc on your neck. A combination of poor posture and stress, which affects your sleep, is likely to be causing unnecessary neck pain. Rarely a sign of something more serious, neck pain can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers such as Voltarol, which can be taken orally or applied directly to the affected area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62b845bdeb714352a4e984dcf30eec572f904d20/0_63_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4deae035f10ad1f87a85a1327fe3e492","title":"uk exaggerated number of lives saved by maternal health aid project","story":"Watchdog says many more deaths could have been prevented given level of investment in Department for International Development programmesThe UK government has been criticised by an aid watchdog for exaggerating the number of women’s lives it saved through its maternal health programmes.A review, published by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai) on Tuesday, also said the number of lives saved “were significantly below what they could have been, given the level of investment”.The watchdog said programmes by Britain’s Department for International Development (DfID) had failed to significantly improve the quality and sustainability of maternal healthcare services in partner countries.DfID spent about £4.6bn on programmes in health and other sectors between 2011 and 2015. Within this, £1.3bn focused more closely on maternal health, including family planning, reproductive healthcare and maternal and neonatal health. But Icai said investments were focused on short-term goals, and did not do enough to strengthen healthcare systems or target marginalised women or teenage girls.By 2015, DfID claimed to have saved 103,000 women’s lives during pregnancy and childbirth, more than double its goal of 50,000. In an internal and unpublished review, this figure was revised down to 80,100.Icai said the department relied on “unrealistic assumptions” to reach such figures. Compared with the review team’s observations in countries such as Malawi, the estimates appeared inflated.Alison Evans, Icai’s chief commissioner, who led the review, said UK aid had expanded access to family planning, but added “… given the ambition, need and level of investment, the programmes fell short of what was required to achieve adequate progress.”Health facilities in partner countries remained chronically under-resourced, with severe shortages of beds, healthcare workers and equipment, said Evans. In northern Malawi, an area visited as part of the review, heavily pregnant women camped outside health facilities for up to a month before giving birth.“They are waiting because they are not sure where they are in their pregnancy cycle because of the lack of ultrasound equipment and the lack of effective dating of pregnancies,” she said. “They don’t know how close to their due dates they are and because they are fearful of giving birth in a situation where there may not be a skilled attendant they wait outside facilities, sometimes for up to a month, sometimes in makeshift accommodation.”UK aid programmes had fallen short of targets to improve emergency obstetric and neonatal care, according to the review.It also failed to include measures that would tackle discrimination and abuse of women in health facilities.Sean Roberts, policy and campaigns officer at Health Poverty Action, said UK aid must be better targeted at the most vulnerable groups. “Indigenous women die far more often in childbirth than other women,” he said. “If DfID wants to meet its commitment to leave no one behind it must implement a robust action plan to address the maternal health of indigenous women and other excluded groups.”While UK aid had improved access to family planning for millions of women, in Malawi such programmes were delivered through non-state providers. Such partnerships allowed funding to quickly reach large numbers of people, but risked displacing public sector services, said Evans.“You have this problem of sustainability,” she said. “The public sector is not able to gear itself up to provide a similar level of outreach.”The review team visited a sample of programmes in Malawi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as analysing published literature, DfID policy documents and conducting interviews with experts.Icai warned that health facilities struggled to ensure a reliable supply of contraceptives. It added that DfID had championed reproductive rights at the international level, but done less work to encourage legal, policy and cultural change in partner countries.DfID said in a statement that the UK is a global leader in promoting reproductive health, and added that the review was not representative of all the department’s work.“We welcome Icai’s acknowledgement that UK aid is helping women around the world access the life-saving services they need, but it is disappointing the report has made some generalisations from a selected portion of our programming and also does not fully reflect the full impact of our work, especially in recent years,” the statement said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f55d050dc41a41e43705c7996ec79aab4bb3e25/167_0_2225_1336/master/2225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efbedd8b5f5724f5c27cd9e18440d6a6","title":"butter nonsense the rise of the cholesterol deniers","story":"A group of scientists has been challenging everything we know about cholesterol, saying we should eat fat and stop taking statins. This is not just bad science – it will cost lives, say expertsButter is back. Saturated fat is good for you. Cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease. Claims along these lines keep finding their way into newspapers and mainstream websites – even though they contradict decades of medical advice. There is a battle going on for our hearts and minds.According to a small group of dissident scientists, whose work usually first appears in minor medical journals, by far the greatest threat to our hearts and vascular systems comes from sugar, while saturated fat has been wrongly demonised. And because cholesterol levels don’t matter, they argue, we don’t need the statins that millions have been prescribed to lower them. A high-fat diet is the secret to a healthy life, they say. Enjoy your butter and other animal fats. Cheese is great. Meat is back on the menu.This is more than bad science, according to leading scientists and medical authorities. It will cost lives. “Encouraging people to eat more saturated fat is dangerous and irresponsible,” is a typical verdict, in this case from Prof Louis Levy, the head of nutrition science at Public Health England (PHE). “There is good evidence that a high intake of saturated fat increases your risk of heart disease. We need to think about where the sources of saturated fat are and how we can reduce them. The largest contributions are dairy products, including butter, and meat and meat products.”The advice from PHE, the World Health Organization, the British Heart Foundation (BHF), Heart UK and other institutions and top academics is consistent. Butter and cheese may be fine in modest amounts in a balanced diet, but the saturated fat that they contain is potentially risky. Too much of it causes the liver to overproduce “bad” LDL cholesterol, which is implicated in heart disease.Mainstream scientists usually keep their disquiet to themselves. But last week, some broke cover over what they see as one medical journal’s support for advocates of a high-fat diet. More than 170 academics signed a letter accusing the British Journal of Sports Medicine of bias, triggered by an opinion piece that it ran in April 2017 calling for changes to the public messaging on saturated fat and heart disease. Saturated fat “does not clog the arteries”, said the piece, which was not prompted by original research. “Coronary artery disease is a chronic inflammatory disease and it can be reduced effectively by walking 22 minutes a day and eating real food,” wrote the cardiologist Aseem Malhotra and colleagues. The BHF criticised the claims as “misleading and wrong”.David Nunan, from Oxford University’s centre for evidence-based medicine, and three colleagues wrote a rebuttal that the journal at first did not use and then, more than a year later, put behind a paywall, while the original article was free. Last week’s letter of complaint asked Dr Fiona Godlee, the editor-in-chief of the BMJ, which publishes the British Journal of Sports Medicine, to intervene, saying the journal had run 10 pieces advocating low-carb diets and criticising statins in the past three years and that the reluctance to run the rebuttal showed a bias and lack of transparency. She replied defending the journal’s right to challenge “the status quo in some settings”, but allowed free access to the rebuttal.Every time a new review or opinion is published in an obscure or unlikely journal – sports medicine is, after all, primarily about helping the fit get even fitter – it is picked up by newspapers that know statin scares sell. Very often in the UK they quote Malhotra, a charming and telegenic young cardiologist in private practice whose website describes him as “one of the most influential and effective campaigning doctors in the world on issues that affect obesity, heart disease and population health”. He is, it says, “not just a cardiologist. This is a man who wants to change the world one meal at a time by not just rocking the system but by rebuilding it.”Malhotra urges a low-carb, high-fat diet. His book, The Pioppi Diet, has the distinction of being named by the British Dietetic Association as one of the five worst “celeb” diet books in Britain – celebrities who have tried it include MPs Keith Vaz and Andy Burnham. It includes lots of fruit and vegetables, olive oil and fish, but otherwise “hijacks” the Mediterranean diet, says the BDA.“The authors may well be the only people in the history of the planet who have been to Italy and come back with a diet named after an Italian village that excludes pasta, rice and bread – but includes coconuts – perhaps because they have a low-carb agenda,” says the BDA. “The suggestion that this Italian village should be associated with recipes for cauliflower-base pizza and rice substitute made from grated cauliflower or anything made using coconut oil is ridiculous. It also uses potentially dangerous expressions like ‘clean meat’ and encourages people to starve themselves for 24 hours at a time every week.”He was accused by Prof Rory Collins at Oxford University of endangering lives. Collins said scare stories about statins could do as much harm as Andrew Wakefield did when he claimed that vaccines caused autism.When it comes to statins, there is a huge database of research. Since 1994, the Nuffield department of population health at Oxford University, led by two eminent epidemiologists, Collins and Prof Richard Peto, has been amassing and analysing the data in order to figure out how well they work in preventing heart attacks and strokes.They have published many papers. In 2016, in a major review in the Lancet, they concluded that lowering cholesterol over five years with a cheap daily statin would prevent 1,000 heart attacks, strokes and coronary artery bypasses among 10,000 people who had already had one. It would also prevent 500 in people who were at increased risk, for instance because of high blood pressure or diabetes.“Our review shows that the numbers of people who avoid heart attacks and strokes by taking statin therapy are very much larger than the numbers who have side-effects with it,” Collins said at the time. Most side-effects can be reversed by stopping the statin, he pointed out – but heart attacks cause permanent damage. “Consequently,” he said, “there is a serious cost to public health from making misleading claims about high side-effect rates that inappropriately dissuade people from taking statin therapy despite the proven benefits.”But the cholesterol sceptics and statins critics reject the evidence on the basis that the trial data is from big pharma and that the raw data is not in the public domain. Maryanne Demasi, a journalist in Australia whose TV programmes questioning statins were pulled from the ABC network because of concerns over impartiality, wrote in January – again in the British Journal of Sports Medicine – of a “crisis of confidence” in the public because “the raw data on the efficacy and safety of statins are being kept secret and have not been subjected to scrutiny by other scientists … Doctors and patients are being misled.”There were cholesterol sceptics before statins existed, doubting the hypothesis that high cholesterol in the blood, particularly in the form of LDL, furs up the arteries, leading in the worst cases to a blood clot that can trigger a heart attack or stroke. Yet, says Dermot Neely, a consultant in clinical biochemistry and metabolic medicine and a founder trustee of the Heart UK charity: “The cholesterol hypothesis is supported by a vast amount of scientific data.” Recently, an expert paper was published by the European Atherosclerosis Society summarising all the evidence, to try to silence the sceptics.But they won’t be silenced. A website called Thincs – The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics – links to published and unpublished papers as well as the various books its members have written, including a joint one entitled Fat and Cholesterol Don’t Cause Heart Attacks. And Statins Are Not the Solution.”That is flat-earthism, says Collins. “The claims that blood LDL cholesterol levels are not causally related to cardiovascular disease (which is really in the same realm as claiming that smoking does not cause cancer) are factually false,” he maintains. He believes there is an argument for refusing to give cholesterol-deniers a platform, just as some will no longer debate with climate change sceptics.Neely says a lot of people ring the nurses and dieticians staffing the Heart UK helpline after reading such stories or hearing about them from family and friends. “We’re very concerned whenever these messages result in people stopping a statin that they were prescribed after their heart attack. Every time there has been a statin scare story in the papers, there is a wave of people who just stop picking up their prescriptions. And as a result of that, many will probably be readmitted with another heart attack down the line,” he says. Some of those are young people who have high cholesterol from birth because of a mutated gene. One of Neely’s patients is a young man whose grandfather and father died of heart attacks at 50. He is on a statin and will be the first in three generations to escape that fate, says Neely.Asked how he can be sure of his position when the vast majority of top research scientists disagree, Ravnskov says: “Because I am right. The reason why the so-called experts say that I am mistaken is that the vast majority are paid generously by the drug companies.” Asked to elaborate, since statins are out of patent and therefore no longer make money for the companies that originally put them on the market, he expounds on the corruption, illegal practices and wealth of pharmaceutical companies.The Oxford researchers, including Collins, have published their funding. The unit has research funds from pharmaceutical companies, but the iniduals do not take money from them. Ironically, say the researchers, if people refuse statins because of concerns over side-effects, they may be put on expensive newer drugs to lower their cholesterol – and this will make money for big pharma.That means statins are given to healthy people to prevent disease and side-effects have become a major issue. The stories are so widespread that people repeat them as if they are incontrovertible, yet the evidence from trials is that even the much-discussed muscle pain is rare. The sceptics dismiss that evidence. Those trials were funded by big pharma, they say, which had a vested interest in hiding any problems with the drugs.Some side-effects may be caused by interactions with other drugs people are on, such as antibiotics. But there is also evidence that some people get muscle pain because they expect to after everything they have heard. It is called the nocebo effect.The dissidents’ arguments are attractively simple. Eat fat, avoid carbs and don’t take the tablets, says Malhotra – who declined to answer questions for this article. We would probably all agree that we should ditch junk food and eat well instead of taking pills. But, realistically, telling people to “eat good food” isn’t going to cut it. The majority of people in the UK and the US are now overweight or obese, with all the heart and vascular problems that brings, and the trend is ever upwards.One thing is for sure – the dissidents are not going to shut up shop. “My belief about the cholesterol sceptics is that they are a bit like religious fundamentalists,” said Neely. “They are not open to argument. Whatever argument you present, they will find another argument because this basically defines who they are.” He cites a cardiologist in the 1980s, Prof Michael Oliver, who was a sceptic of the cholesterol hypothesis that more LDL increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Oliver did a U-turn as more evidence accumulated, saying: “When the facts change, I change my mind.” But, says Neely, “unfortunately the cholesterol sceptics we know currently don’t do that”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5f716d56fad58c9dd33136c6e2ab23703beb93/0_215_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fed8482a4fcac14d49b79093cc6e069e","title":"assange must follow new ecuador embassy rules says judge","story":"WikiLeaks founder claims regulations are bid to coerce him into ending asylumA judge in Ecuador has ruled against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, rejecting his request to loosen new requirements that he says are meant to push him into leaving his asylum in the country’s embassy in London.The judge, Karina Martínez, found that stricter rules recently imposed by the South American nation’s embassy – such as requiring Assange to pay for his internet and clean up after his cat – do not violate his asylum rights because authorities have the right to decide what is and isn’t allowed inside the building.Ecuadorian officials praised the ruling in the latest row between the Australian hacker and the government that has given him refuge for six years. Relations between Assange and Ecuador have grown increasingly prickly as the years have dragged on, with no resolution in sight.Assange’s lawyer vowed to appeal against the decision. “The Ecuadorian state has an international responsibility to protect Mr Assange,” attorney Carlos Poveda said.Assange argued that the new measures, which make it more difficult for him to receive visitors and requiring him to pay for services such as laundry and medical bills, are meant to coerce him into ending his asylum. Ecuador’s government contended that the requirements were aimed at peaceful cohabitation in tight quarters in the small embassy, where Assange takes up more than a third of the space. Officials have complained that his soccer playing and skateboarding have damaged the building.“It’s clear this protocol was issued with strict respect for international law,” Jose Valencia, Ecuador’s foreign minister, said after the ruling.Ecuador granted Assange asylum in the embassy in 2012 as he tried to avoid extradition to Sweden. Sweden’s top prosecutor later dropped a long-running inquiry into a rape allegation against him, saying there was no way to detain or charge him because of his protected status in the embassy.Nonetheless, Assange remains wanted in Britain for jumping bail, and he also fears a possible extradition to the US based on his leaking of classified state department documents.Assange initially enjoyed a cosy relationship with the then Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa, but relations with his host nation have steadily deteriorated. The current president, Lenín Moreno, has warned him not to meddle in matters that could jeopardise Ecuador’s foreign relations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15c5390caf98bfbdb72cda30446cc5147ec06063/0_0_1824_1094/master/1824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49725b53b5502cb69d832a30cfa3c0f8","title":"budget 2018 what it means for you","story":"We’ve looked at the figures to see how Philip Hammond’s budget will affect your finances – whether you’re single, married, with or without children or retired•Read all our budget coverage in fullAll figures supplied by Turquoise Training \u0026amp Consultancy (some have been rounded to nearest pound).Married couple with two sons aged 16 and 13. £16k, £24k2018-19 They pay combined annual income tax of £3,256 and national insurance of £2,778.

She receives housing benefit on her £800-a-month rent, plus income support and disability living allowance adding up to another £400 a month, plus a small amount of carer’s allowance.“I’ve not yet moved to universal credit, and I don’t know for sure what the impact will be. But I’ve done some calculations and I think it will be less. In fact, it could be quite a lot less, and that will have a massive impact. It may mean we have to move somewhere a lot smaller,” she says.“My personal budget is at breakeven – or worse – every month. It’s a vicious cycle of using credit cards and having to watch every single penny, and I just don’t think Monday’s announcements will change that.”Hunter Ruthven, 31, works for an agency that seeks to improve productivity among small UK businesses. He is a higher rate taxpayer, earning more than £50,000 a year, so will gain about £520 from the higher personal allowances beginning in April 2019.“Every little helps, I suppose. Will it make a huge difference? No, as I suppose I’m lucky enough to have got to the point where I don’t have to count every penny. I will probably look at increasing the amount I put into my pension every month.”“I don’t have a personal issue with the amount of tax I have to pay. I’m happy as a higher earner that I’m paying a higher rate of tax. For me it’s more about the general cost of living.”Despite enjoying a good income, saving for a deposit on a home in London has been struggle.Does he feel hard done by compared to preceding generations? “My parents were able to buy a flat in Highgate in the 1980s for £38,000. But I’m a pragmatist about these things. That said, I have a lot of friends who feel quite a lot of animosity about this. But I don’t think there’s a magic wand.”Sarah Hosking, 78, says she normally watches the budget to find out what is happening with pensions, the winter fuel allowance, VAT and so on – but this time she feels Brexit has made the announcements and forecasts largely irrelevant.“The uncertainty caused by Brexit is so profound ... I honestly think this is arranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.”Hosking lives near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, and manages on an income of £19,000 a year. She is the founder-secretary of Hosking Houses Trust, a charity that gives bursaries and residencies to women writers over the age of 40.Hosking says of budget financial measures relating to pensioners: “There seemed to be no change.”Overall she was not impressed with Philip Hammond’s budget: “The big issues are our relationship with Europe and climate change. One is uncertain and the other is largely ignored.”Hosking says that living in a “theatre town” – the Royal Shakespeare Company is based in Stratford-upon-Avon – she is very worried about what Brexit will mean for the arts.Steven Champion and Claire Lockey are pleased the chancellor has extended by two year the help-to-buy scheme that recently helped them purchase their first £366,000 London home, but they fear for others stuck renting in the capital.Champion, 37, who works in financial education and social worker Lockey, 30 , recently become first-time buyers of a two-bed flat in Barking with some deposit help from family – and by using the help-to-buy equity scheme and help-to-buy ISA.“The help-to-buy scheme has selfishly helped us, but we fear for others renting in London. It’s fair to say that had it been scrapped, it would have proved impossible for us to buy in London. Ultimately, a bigger solution to the London housing crises is needed,” says Champion.Lockey agrees: “Even as public servants in key roles we simply don’t earn enough to be able to save the way lots of our friends working in the private sector can! Help To Buy was really the only way we could get on the ladder on London. Like others we would have been forced out of the capital.” Both of them had been renting since the age of 18, with Lockey even doing a stint as a property  when she first moved to London to save money on rent.The pair used online mortgage broker Habito to find their £200,000 mortgage. The government provided an equity loan of £146,400 – which is interest-free for the first five years.They say they move has allowed them to swap a flat costing £1,150 to rent to a bigger partially owned home costing £865month in mortgage payments.John Socha, 60, says the budget is “another turn in the screw” for landlords. In a little-noticed move in the budget, landlords will no longer be able to claim the £40,000 lettings relief on their capital gains tax (CGT) bill when they sell a property.“I think there’s someone in the Treasury who really, really hates landlords,” says Socha, who has 25 properties mostly around Northamptonshire.“The new tax regime on buy to let is madness. In any other business you are able to write your costs off against your income, but you can’t do this with mortgages any longer.”He reckons that many other landlords will ‘incorporate’ their portfolios to mitigate the impact of the additional CGT. He says CGT is a huge issue for landlords, particularly those who want to sell out because of the earlier tax rises introduced by George Osborne in 2015. If they keep their properties, the tax rises may make running them unprofitable, but if they sell they will be hit by a big CGT bill.“Some buy to let landlords have started to pull out because of the tax changes. But I’m buying more, and I’ve also started building. The thing about selling out is the CGT you have to pay. There was some talk before the budget about reducing CGT if you sell to your tenant, and that would have been a good idea.”Scoha was 38 when he bought his first buy-to-let, an ex-council two-bed semi for £15,000, selling it later for £85,000. “ I like to think of myself as a good landlord we properly decorate all the flats and houses and everything is legally compliant. I try not to put up rents too much, I’d rather keep a good tenant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f68564c05edf1e525be49b386513b5b91dcf1020/0_182_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=745b95d21895469a50c0c59802c70ca5","title":"stool samples a history of chairs in pop from westlife to britney","story":"To mark the return of the key change-loving Irish balladeers, here’s a celebration of music’s most comfortable accessory It is impossible to overestimate the power of the stool as a boyband essential. The humble accessory has allowed Boyzone, Backstreet Boys and One Direction to signal a key change by rising up from it. Hell, Westlife built their careers around it. Except that time in 2001 when they shocked fans by giving the Where Dreams Come True tour the unofficial moniker the No Stool Tour. Flying Without Wings? Easy. Touring without stools? Never.Back in the 60s, when Daft Punk disco helmets and Miley Cyrus’s giant foam hand were just a futuristic dream, stage props were simple. Who placed the first stool? Joni Mitchell and the Everly Brothers were all known to embrace the medium, along with Val Doonican and the Carpenters. Simon and Garfunkel, however, took it to another level when they perched back-to-back on theirs during the hate years.Prince’s chrome Kiss stool – upon which a nonchalant Wendy Melvoin strums away as the purple one gyrates around her – deserves a category of its own.No stool, no problem.

Especially when their combined force chair-dances them into chair-like submission in the Whatta Man video. “The Female Boss” Tulisa took the trend to new heights in her lesser-known Living Without You smize-fest, in which she bypassed the chair altogether and just plonked a man on all fours and used him like DFS’s finest.The band who looked like Queer Eye’s Fab Five before they found their style mojo employed both a spinning office chair and a saucy sofa upon which to seduce their foxtresses in the I Wanna Sex You Up video.Britney Spears showed the world she was capable of replacing Justin Timberlake with a chair in her Stronger video, which also paid homage to Janet Jackson’s extreme shoulder-shrug seat from the Miss U Much breakdown.  And who could forget the iconic moment when Nicole Scherzinger led the Pussycat Dolls in a chair-zinger in their Buttons video?It was all fun and games when Madonna let her dancers tie her to a chair in the Human Nature video, but Take That’s faux-terrified looks in the How Deep Is Your Love? clip tell another story. Being chair-bound helped Nick Jonas prove he was all grown up in Chains, a video in which he was also inexplicably kettled. (Why didn’t Tina Arena think of this? The chains, not the kettling. That wasn’t a thing in the 90s.)Drake’s Bruce Forysth-esque dancing grabbed the headlines in his Hotline Bling video, but he did stop for a nice sit down on the stairs. Ariana Grande later adopted the Kermit-style croon on the stairs for Raindrops, a move that would surely have horrified the Spice Girls in their staircase-stomping heyday.That great prophet of pop Jamiroquai once predicted “Future’s made of virtual insanity”, and how right he was. Duke Dumont ft Jax Jones’s I Got U may have been full of exotic locations, fish and bikinis, but it’s all brought to you from the humble chair, courtesy of a virtual reality helmet.Nicki Minaj has revolutionised many pop tropes and she breathes new life into the chair-dance in her Anaconda video. In the bum-heavy clip, she combines the chair throb with a classic touch-the-toes-and-put-that-booty-in-the-air move.As standards of behaviour in pop slip, Dua Lipa can be found dancing upon a sofa for Electricity, her collaboration with Silk City.

Thank you.Will the beginning of the end for Angela Merkel in Germany have an impact on Brexit negotiations, many will ask this week. Brexiters will be certain to draw the conclusion that it will.While her grip on the party may be loosened and the German coalition government under pressure, sources in Brussels say it will not unsettle the EU27 in negotiations. Brexiters may draw other conclusions.Two weeks after negotiations were “paused” by Dominic Raab on his Sunday visit to Brussels, the secretive “tunnel” talks have yet to resume.Communication between Britain’s most senior official, Olly Robbins, and Michel Barnier’s deputy, Sabine Weyand, are said to be constant and some lower-level meetings have taken place since the October EU council summit, but the intense phase of negotiations has not yet resumed.Midweek, Donald Tusk shed more light on the origin of the idea that the transition period could be extended. It wasn’t the EU’s idea, it emerged. It was May’s.Back at home, clarity on Brexit remains in short supply. May confirmed in parliament that she was considering a short extension to the transition period in a bid to break the impasse over the Irish border.However, she laid down four new conditions, or red lines, for a border deal and in doing so sowed more confusion than constructive progress. One of her “steps” to a deal is a legally binding UK-wide customs arrangement in exchange for a backstop.But the EU and Ireland say these are not commutable and a backstop must remain in the legally binding withdrawal agreement to guard against a hard border in all circumstances.The Gordian knot may be tightening, but there was also talk of a “bridge” between the withdrawal agreement, which is legally binding, and the political declaration, which is not.One draft of a new idea posits the idea of a customs-wide arrangement being given legally binding status is a separate treaty that would link the two, as our Brussels bureau chief, Dan Boffey, explains at the end of this analysis.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Michael Gove, the environment secretary, voiced their concerns over a time-limited backstop at a stormy cabinet meeting midweek, while the cabinet secretary, David Lidington, warned that no deal would be as bad as Black Wednesday.Earlier, the Northern Ireland secretary and May loyalist, Karen Bradley, said the government would not renege on its commitment to the backstop while the Irish ambassador to the UK warned a backstop with a time limit is not a backstop.One solution, which seems to be growing in popularity among some Brexiters, is for the UK to dump the Chequers proposal and simply go straight to the European Economic Area model and then pivot to a deal after, say, five years.The idea was first suggested by Nick Boles, the Tory MP and former minister who is a close ally of Gove.

Thought to have been lived in between about 5,500 and 3,300 years ago, the site caused a stir when discovered in 2002 because it revealed a previously unknown ancient society now called the Mayo Chinchipe culture.The team analysed items including stone mortars, ceramic bowls, bottles and jars for traces of cacao. The results reveal six of the artefacts tested contained starch grains from a group of plants to which the cacao tree belongs – grains found in particular parts of plants, including the seeds. What’s more, theobromine – a bitter-tasting substance found in high concentrations in cacao seeds – cropped up in 25 ceramic and 21 stone artefacts.Members of the team also looked at ancient genetic material in pottery from the site, finding that several fragments bore mitochondrial DNA – genetic material from within the cells – that could only be from cacao.Blake said the discovery of traces of cacao in fancy containers, some of which were funeral offerings found in tombs, means it might have been an important part of feasting and ritual behaviour.“It means even in these distant times it was a special use of this delicious beverage, and maybe even ceremonial beverage, that drew people’s attention to it and perhaps sparked its movement throughout the rest of the Americas,” he said.The discovery backs up previous hints that cacao might have been used long ago in Ecuador: ancient ceramics from the area decorated with pictures of cacao pods have been found, while previous research that has shown that the upper Amazon is home to the greatest genetic ersity of Theobroma cacao – the cacao tree.“It confirms what botanists have long suspected – that the Amazonian region is where we might expect to find some of the first use,” said Blake.Indeed, recent genetic research revealed that the Criollo variety of cacao originated in northern Ecuador but was fully domesticated in Central America about 3,600 years ago.But Dr Omar Cornejo of Washington State University, who led the Criollo study, said while the new findings offered convincing evidence cacao was being used in Ecuador thousands of years ago, it did not show that cacao actually underwent domestication there – a process that involves intensive breeding and leaves strong genetic signatures. However, Dr Cameron McNeil, an archaeobotanist at Lehman College in the City University of New York, agreed with Blake.“The type of cacao that was first introduced to Mesoamerica, where the Maya are, was already domesticated,” she said, “but domestication occurs along a continuum, and the Maya and other Mesoamericans most certainly continued to domesticate cacao varieties to suit their particular tastes. One can argue that the Maya turned the consumption of cacao into an art form.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de66c585b3233c46a97b8cde3bb3c47d8af27e3d/0_31_4104_2462/master/4104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=149b1efe93ce4f440f41d886d6afe8e9","title":"philip hammond universal credit is here to stay","story":"Chancellor unveils extra investment as Labour calls for benefit to be fixed before next stage of rolloutUniversal credit is here to stay, Philip Hammond has said, as he announced extra investment in the flagship benefit aimed at making it more generous to some low-income working claimants.By injecting £1.7bn into work allowances, the chancellor reversed much of the cut to universal credit made by his predecessor, George Osborne, in 2015 and suggested ministers were fully committed to the much-delayed benefits overhaul programme.Hammond’s cash-for-work allowances may be enough to head off a threatened revolt by Conservative backbenchers concerned that some low-income working families on tax credits would be £200 a month worse off after moving to universal credit.“Universal credit is here to stay and we are putting in the funding needed to make it a success,” Hammond told the Commons. He said it was a “long overdue and necessary reform” of the benefits system that would help drive jobs and growth.Hammond also announced an extra £1bn over five years to provide extra protection for people on tax credits and other benefits who would be moved over to universal credit in the next few years. Details will be announced this year.There will be “run-on” support from 2020, whereby unemployed claimants will continue to receive existing benefits for two weeks after submitting their universal credit application, in a move aimed at easing the long waiting time for a first payment.Universal credit rolls together six working-age benefits into a single monthly payment, including jobseeker’s allowance, working tax credits and housing benefits. Work allowances are the amount claimants can earn before benefits start to be withdrawn. Higher work allowances in theory encourage claimants to move into work, or work longer hours.The Resolution Foundation thinktank welcomed the work allowance boost, saying the £1,000 threshold increase would deliver a £630 boost to low-income families, meaning universal credit was now more generous than the benefit system it was replacing.Torsten Bell, the Resolution Foundation chief executive, said: “While today’s reforms certainly won’t end all the problems some recipients have faced with universal credit, they should ease the rollout in the months and years ahead.”However, opposition politicians and charities emphasised ministers had not addressed wider cuts to welfare or structural problems with universal credit, such as the long waiting times for payment that forced some families into debt or to rely on food banks.John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, said: “The money promised for universal credit is less than a third of the £7bn of social security cuts still to come and today’s announcement on work allowances reverses just over half the cuts made in 2015.”Matthew Reed, the chief executive at the Children’s Society, said: “While the government has taken some important steps in the right direction it has still not done enough to address serious problems with universal credit which are causing hardship for many families.”Alison Garnham, the chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: “The work allowance increase is unequivocally good news for families receiving universal credit but a bigger salvage operation is still needed for the benefit.”Hammond’s striking endorsement of universal credit comes after criticism from two previous prime ministers, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown, who said the changes could trigger poll tax-levels of public unpopularity.Labour has called for universal credit to be halted and fixed before the next stage of its rollout, which will lead to 2 million claimants on tax credits and employment and support allowance migrate on to the new system during the next three years.The chancellor has also been under intense pressure from Conservative backbenchers and poverty campaigners to restore the level of work allowances, seen by many as essential if universal credit is to uphold its original aims of incentivising work.Hammond pointedly paid tribute to the political architect of universal credit, the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, now a backbench MP, “without whose tenacity universal credit would never have seen the light”.Duncan Smith oversaw the introduction of universal credit in the face of opposition from Osborne and a series of implementation disasters. He resigned from the cabinet in 2016 in part over cuts to work allowances the previous autumn.The chancellor’s announcement on work allowances was welcomed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which called it “an important step forward” in tackling the rise of in-work poverty that it said would help ease the burden for low-income families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/306fbc40500039913c6fc0e5ae59a5d7b8572648/287_131_4187_2512/master/4187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f66b6dd3447b5178e86c69d06b8233d5","title":"england test stuart broad sri lanka joe root","story":"Joe Root keeps England’s options open as they gear up for the opening Test against Sri Lanka with seamer’s place one of several difficult decisions aheadIf there is no cricket scheduled in Colombo the sun shines obediently. England were able to set to work at the Nondescripts ground in the heart of Colombo with their red balls. On Tuesday they begin the first of two two-day practice matches. These are not first-class games and they may prove to be an ugly spectacle as all the batsmen bat and all the bowlers bowl.These matches will hardly be a contest from England’s perspective they are more likely to be a series of little battles between players eager to nail down a place for the first Test in Galle on 6 November.Root could do no more than offer steers: there was no guarantee Jonny Bairstow will be fit for the first Test, in which case Jos Buttler behind the stumps was “the likely scenario”, though the presence of Ben Foakes “gives us another way to balance the side up”. It remains Root’s preference to bat at four.The simple truth is Root and Trevor Bayliss are not absolutely certain who their best team are. Hence there was much talk of the virtue of having so many options and the importance of the next four days of practice, which are likely to be painful to watch and, for several borderliners in the squad, stressful to play in.There are tricky decisions to be made everywhere and perhaps the trickiest relates to Stuart Broad. To his credit Broad is a great survivor. Recently there has been discussion within the England hierarchy of Broad being one of the bowlers to be rotated or rested for the greater good. One media outlet assured us he would be dropped for this tour but he is here and eager to play. However the possibility of England wanting to play three spinners in Galle, where the ball is expected to turn in Rangana Herath’s last Test, enhances the chances Broad really will be rotated this time.Root’s response to the Broad question was Delphic it could be interpreted in various ways. “I wouldn’t say it’s a changing of the guard and I wouldn’t say he’s in a weaker position than he has been previously,” he said.“We still haven’t finalised the team. He could still definitely play a massive part within the three-match series and definitely the first game is an option. But we have struggled away from home a number of times now, so we are trying to find a different formula with him or without him.“I don’t think it weakens him as a player or where his game is going. I think he’s actually improving all the time and using his experience wisely. His action is as strong as it has ever been but whether we have to find a different formula we’ll just have to wait and see. We have to make a real, clear call on what’s going to be the best side on a given surface.”Sir Humphrey would have been proud of Root’s perambulation. A guess is that Broad is likely to be left out, which probably means he will produce a four for 10 spell over the next few days.The other debate centres on the identity of the opening batsmen. Keaton Jennings is the only one in the squad who has opened regularly for England recently, yet there remains a good argument he should give way to Rory Burns and Joe Denly with the possibility of Moeen Ali continuing at No 3. In this instance runs over the next few days for any of the three new(ish) boys will be significant.So Root has plenty to ponder though his concerns are pinpricks compared with the recent experiences of the former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga, who “feared for his life” at the weekend.Until last Friday Ranatunga was a government minister then one person was killed by his security detail amid unrest outside his former office as Ranatunga collected some of his personal effects. He has since been arrested. The political situation is volatile with the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, sacked by the president and replaced by a former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.The England and Wales Cricket Board is continuing with its preparations for the series as planned but said: “We are aware of the developments and are in constant contact with the British High Commission. We are exercising vigilance and avoiding all demonstrations or large political gatherings.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abf1074def5ee128f64a2b60f3aa45bf48594e63/0_123_3354_2013/master/3354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a02e2316bb2be54774e6bf92f009de","title":"we just saw the greatest team in boston red sox history","story":"Alex Cora’s players started the season well, and just got better. No wonder owner John Henry called them the best Red Sox team everAs he lifted the World Series trophy, Boston Red Sox owner John Henry proclaimed the 2018 edition was “the best Red Sox team in history in so many ways”. It wasn’t surprising that Henry would be inspired to say that while he was caught up in the joy of victory what was surprising was that he was probably right. The moment that the Red Sox defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 5 of the World Series, they cemented their place as the best all-around team in the history of Boston baseball.It’s something of a bold claim for a team that has has been around, in one form or another, since 1901 and now has nine championships to its name. Still, the numbers alone back it up. The Red Sox won 108 games during the regular season, a franchise record, and combined to win 119 games in total after they breezed their way through the postseason. The Ringer’s Zach Kram, making the case for the 2018 Red Sox being one of the best teams of all time, noted that the only teams that won more combined games were the 1998 New York Yankees and the 2001 Seattle Mariners (and the Mariners didn’t even make the World Series).Then there are the teams the Red Sox had to beat during this year’s playoffs. In the ALDS they faced a New York Yankees team that won 100 games. In the ALCS, they defeated a Houston Astros team that had won 103 and then easily handled a very dangerous Dodgers team to secure their fourth championship of the century. In the end, the Red Sox lost a grand total of three playoff games, losing once per series. It took the Dodgers 18 innings to beat the Red Sox in the only World Series game they won and even then they needed Boston second baseman Ian Kinsler to make several game-changing errors to pull it off.If it feels strange to call this the greatest Red Sox team, it may be because they lack the mystique of past teams. There’s no Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Roger Clemens, Pedro Martinez or David Ortiz on the 2018 Red Sox. Mookie Betts will almost certainly win AL MVP honors, but few outside of New England would be able to pick him out of a lineup. Yet it many ways, it was the most complete Red Sox team we have ever seen. Their starting rotation features Chris Sale, David Price and Rick Porcello, all of whom who have won Cy Young awards. Offseason acquisition JD Martinez hit 43 home runs during the regular season while shortstop Xander Bogaerts had one of the quietest 100+ RBI seasons in recent baseball memory. Craig Kimbrel, despite his shaky playoff performance, has been one of the most dominant closers in baseball for much of his career.It wasn’t just about the star players either. Everyone on the roster was capable of having a big game, something that became very apparent during their postseason run. Outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr hit ninth for much of the regular season, but he was named ALCS MVP thanks to an unexpected power surge. Steve Pearce, a bench player the team acquired for basically nothing, ended up being the World Series MVP. They were stronger than their inidual parts, and the parts were pretty damn good on their own.Every World Series is special in its own right. The 2018 squad will never be the most important Red Sox team in history, that will always be the 2004 edition that won the franchise’s first championship in 86 years. The 2007 team was noteworthy because it proved that Boston could win with a group of homegrown talent (Dustin Pedroia, Jon Lester, Jonathan Papelbon, Jacoby Ellsbury). The overachieving 2013 team helped the city recover from the trauma of the Boston Marathon bombing. (It will require a baseball historian to say what the Boston teams that won in 1903, 1912, 1915, 1916 and 1918 meant to fans.)The greatness of these 2018 champions was that they made baseball look easy. They began the season on a 17-2 run and never relinquished their lead in the AL East for too long, even with the Yankees putting together their own 100-win season. They practically clinched the ision way back in August after they swept their arch rivals in New York in a four-game series. Like every team, the Red Sox had their share of painful losses, but they had a remarkable ability to bounce back. They never lost more than three games in a row at any point of the season. In many ways, the club adopted the character of their first-year manager Alex Cora, who remained calm and optimistic no matter what chaos swirled around him.“Calm and optimistic” are not traits normally associated with Red Sox Nation, so it took time for fans to adjust to being the odds-on favorites for most of the season. If they complained too much about the bullpen or David Price’s occasional implosions during the regular season, it was more because fans always need something to complain about. In any case, when it came down to the postseason, even those perceived weaknesses turned into strengths. Because that’s how things went for the 2018 Red Sox, a team that put together the most successful and, indeed, enjoyable seasons in team history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be39331a06a85fe8ac6e7f6fd23b87a3aff9432c/1607_431_2863_1717/master/2863.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b7b16a1237be1d4cb3b53d5e201947a","title":"christmas past the charm of dennis severs house london","story":"A Spitalfields townhouse that immerses visitors in the 18th and 19th centuries is at its most magical at Christmas  The hubbub of Liverpool Street station and Spitalfields Market is only a few hundred metres away but on the doorstep of 18 Folgate Street not much is stirring. There is only intermittent noise: the roar of Christmas revellers as the doors to the Water Poet pub opposite open and close. It is 4.58pm and having rat-a-tatted a brass knocker on the door, I’m waiting to be granted entrance to Dennis Severs’ House for a 5pm tour. The Grade II-listed Georgian terrace is a wonderful curio, offering a perspective on family life in 18th- and 19th-century London. But more than that – it’s a work of art that seems to delight, challenge and perplex visitors in equal measure.With me on the doorstep are the Daniels, an older American couple who have spent the past 30 minutes in the Water Poet and are eager for some calm. They are going to get it, though perhaps a little more than they had bargained for. At 5pm the front door opens and we are greeted and given (whispered) instructions on what we are about to experience: 10 rooms across four floors, each presented in a different historic style and arranged as if the (fictional) Jervis family had left them just moments before our arrival. This family of Huguenot silk weavers and the “house as artwork” were created by Dennis Severs, a Californian who felt drawn to England, acquired the property in 1979 and spent the next 20 years creating this “still-life drama”.When I ask how Severs, who died in 2000, would have described himself, our greeter says: “Today, maybe as a performance or installation artist.” When the Daniels ask if there’s an audio guide to hire, our greeter says: “No.” Silence is golden here, and present-day London’s office blocks will be shuttered from us. We are asked not to talk or take photographs, informed the only light will come from candles and told: “Your senses will be your only guide.”Were we allowed to speak, Gadzooks, gorblimey and yea verily would be the appropriate period language to describe what we see (and hear and smell). However, there is seriousness at the heart of this house: it was Severs’ intention that each room be experienced as if it were a painting – with the bonus of being able to stroll around in it.As I walk from the low-ceilinged basement rooms (cellar and kitchen) and up creaking stairs through the house – dallying in its parlours, smoking room, drawing room, print room and bedchambers – Severs’ intent becomes clear, bringing a stillness and absorption I rarely experience in galleries and museums. It’s the very absence of texts and explanations that makes the house such a contemplative journey. In each room I take in the scene but also focus on details: crockery dashed to the floor, an elaborate vanity screen, a brass bell at a bedside, socks stuffed inside shoes, half-finished meals, half-emptied glasses. And in the first-floor smoking room, beneath a Hogarth-esque painting of extreme merriment, that scene is (almost) duplicated a chair knocked over, clothing strewn about, glasses and bottles toppled.My 45-minute, time-capsule trip over, I chat to our greeter once again outside the house. The Daniels are long gone. He tells me it’s precisely what I liked about the house that causes others to “hate” it. Some come expecting detailed explanations: a why, where and how of everything. But Dennis Severs’ House is defiantly not a museum. Its motto is “You either see it or you don’t,” though I feel “You either get it or you don’t” might be more appropriate.• 18 Folgate Street, London, dennissevershouse.

Its outer edge encircles the tiny island, splitting crystal clear waters from the heaving dark blue of the Pacific beyond.It lends the atoll – the second most populous of the 15 Cook Islands – an air of stillness.“Pretty amazing view, hey?,” I say to a rare group of American tourists we find at the top of the hillside. “Yeah, incredible,” one responds, smiling.Time on Aitutaki still moves with the kind of slow, lazy gait long lost to the more tourist-dense island paradises, like Bali or Phuket. Only 2,000-odd people live on Aitutaki, and the community has been careful to keep its long, arcing beaches peaceful, free from pollution or the western hordes.It has a modest tourist trade but is far from overrun. The resorts that are here, like the boutique Etu Moana villas, have been careful to maintain the island’s relaxed air. The elegant rooms sit just off the water, their thatched roofs hidden among the palm trees. In the evenings, my partner and I sit on the veranda, cocktails in hand, watching the sun lower itself toward the horizon.Our mornings are spent uninterrupted, usually exploring the teeming reef, chasing tropical fish til exhaustion. The waters, still as glass, light up with the reds of the angelfish and the yellows of the butterfly fish as they flee into forests of coral.Out beyond the reef, between July and October, whales can be seen making their great migration south, heading to the warm Pacific waters to breed and give birth.Shops in the main town of Arutanga are counted on the digits of one hand, and cars are outnumbered by the population of cats roaming the island.Eteta Fepuleai and her family have run a small takeaway restaurant, Puffy’s Beach Bar and Grill, on Aitutaki for almost 18 years. Puffy’s is the best kind of takeaway joint. Unpretentious, cheap and simple, it doesn’t stray from what it does best: fresh seafood, salads, burgers and cold beer.But when Fepuleai began, it was one of the only takeaways here. Over the years competitors have sprung up as more tourists sought out Aitutaki’s paradise. “It’s changed a lot,” she says. “A lot of businesses compared to us, a lot of takeaways have come up. I don’t really worry, because everyone knows us. They know the way we cook.”Fepuleai spent much of her life in nearby New Zealand, before returning to her place of birth. It’s not an uncommon story.Curiously, there are more Cook Islanders in New Zealand than in the Cook Islands. But more and more are returning home. Most come back to Rarotonga.Like Tupou Metutaopu, a New Zealander whose parents were born in the Cook Islands. He came back to Rarotonga five years ago to reconnect with his roots. Metutaopu now helps crew for Koka Lagoon Cruise, a company that runs glass-bottomed boats in the waters off Rarotonga.“Locals who used to live here are coming back,” Metutaopu says. “I’m from New Zealand, born and bred in Wellington. My mum and dad are from here.”Metutaopu is speaking to me while standing in the shallows of Muri beach as he unloads the boat after finishing a long morning on the water. We’d just spent half the day on the lagoon cruise, which weaves its way through the reef before making landfall on one of the islands scattered off Rarotonga’s eastern coast for lunch.Within minutes of casting off, hand drums and wood-carved ukuleles materialise in the hands of the crew. The music is an eclectic mix of traditional Polynesian songs and western pop hits, all set to the rapid, bright strum of the ukulele. We’re on the first of two daily cruises run by Koka. Much of the cruise is spent in water, exploring the reef, and watching as the crew try to lure Roger, an impossibly large eel, from his hiding place in the coral. When we stop at an uninhabited island for lunch – a fresh seafood barbecue – one of the crew expertly climbs to the upper reaches of a palm tree, without a hint of fear, to retrieve fresh coconuts. They make a show of teaching tourists how to open the harvest and use the milk or oil inside. We’re taught how to weave coconut leaves into a basket, and how to tie a sarong in the traditional style.The smiles have not left the crew’s faces all day.“Everyone’s happy,” Metutaopu says. “If you’re not happy, you’re in the wrong place. Don’t bother coming.” It’s hard, of course, for any tourist to truly understand what Metutaopu means when he talks about the Cook Islands’ culture. It’s the product of a people who lived uninterrupted on these islands for 1,000 years, from 500AD, when the first Polynesians arrived, until the Spanish sailor Alvaro de Mendaña sighted Pukapuka in 1595. Captain Cook, for whom the islands are named, was not far behind the Spanish. Nor were the missionaries, who brought disease, but also a Christian tradition that is now deep-rooted and a profound influence on daily life in the Cook Islands.On Rarotonga, an island of 14,000 people, the white coral and limestone churches are ubiquitous. They seem almost to outnumber the bars and cafes along the single 32km road that circles the island. But Christianity has not pushed out the traditions of the Cook Islanders.We’re on the island for Te Maeva Nui, a week-long festival of dance, song, and culture, designed to celebrate the Cook Islands’ birth as an independent nation. Huge numbers have come from all over the far-flung islands to take part.Tickets are at a premium, and the local news carries stories of parking woes and “heavy congestion” – most unusual for the Cook Islands – when the singing and dancing finally finishes at Rarotonga’s main auditorium. The situation is so dire that the police are even warning of a crackdown on illegal parkers.It’s the event that, quite literally, brings the small nation to a standstill.When I first take my seat in the auditorium, I’m unsure of what to expect. There’s a restless energy in the overwhelmingly local crowd.Drums begin to beat in the darkness.A spotlight casts down on a lone woman, her face partially covered by a floral headdress. Her voice rings out, soaring out across the auditorium and stilling those still nattering in the stands.The stage lights up. Dancers dressed in green, red, and yellow begin slapping the floor in unison. They quickly jump up and begin moving as one. Pendulum hips swing. The men pound their hands on thighs. The drums roll again.It’s a dizzying display of sound and colour. And it continues on throughout the night, each act as impressive as the last.There is a striking iniduality between the cultures of the 15 islands, born of the great distance between each and their varying histories of migration.Some have come a long way to be in Rarotonga for Te Maeva Nui.There’s a team from Pukapuka, known as “the island of beautiful girls”, the northernmost atoll and the most remote part of the Cook Islands. It’s closer to Samoa (750km away) than Rarotonga (1,140km away), and its culture is linked more closely with its Pacific neighbour.The island is stunning and all but untouched, largely because getting there is nigh-on impossible for tourists.An occasional charter plane lands on the a tiny airfield on one of Pukapuka’s three islets, but it runs sporadically – usually once every six weeks – and is often full of government officials. Some tourists have been known to board the cargo ships that try to get supplies to Pukapuka four times a year.But there is no set schedule for the ships.

We also learned why Eunice, Eve, Michel and Alice had kept the truth from her, and that Tutsis as well as Hutus were capable of atrocities.As is sometimes the case, the penultimate episode of a drama dropped its biggest bombs. This final episode had nothing to match last week’s great twist. There was, however, some reckoning and Shakespearean bloodletting in the final act. The surviving players, meanwhile, found a measure of truth, in some cases reconciliation, and the prospect of a dusty road ahead to better possibilities.First, at last, a meeting with the sisters – a calm and frank exchange, though Alice is handcuffed. President Bibi Mundanzi demands that Alice withdraw her insurrectionary claims for the sake of peace in Rwanda. Alice insists that “we have a duty to memory”. But Bibi reminds Alice of a story from their childhood, when cattle died from having been led to poisoned waters. Alice had persuaded Bibi to carry the can for that (“Let them believe it was the strange little white-eyed girl”). It was the last time she would take her advice.Kate is in Africa. She is shown the gravestone of Eve’s partner Ed, her saviour, who died in 1997. It would not have been uncovered if the farmers had not been burning the land for crops. She walks away from the landscape, fires blazing symbolically all around.Back in London, Michael is surprised to be approached by a probate officer and informed that Blake Gaines had made him a beneficiary of his will. It isn’t his car collection, sadly, but a copy of the unpaid invoice from the Universal Church of Christ the Peacemaker and a photograph of industrialist Richard Ratzenburger.As Harper reads a novel to Michael’s daughter Hana, Michael receives a call on behalf of Frank Munzero. It is regarding a lead his daughter was following up in her professional work before she suffered the crash that has left her in her present condition. Michael and the representative meet. It turns out that Kromin, the mining company working in Rwanda, have been paying off Ganimana and his people $23m a year not to interfere with their work, the payments being made to the Universal Church of Christ the Peacemaker, who only have two branches of their church, one in London, the other in the DRC, in the Sankele, the Kromin village. It’s a front.Sadly, we also learn that it was Florence who stole the tape from the fault. Oh, Florence. Worse, here he is en route to Sankele to meet “Samson”, aka Nkanga, who is now a member of the police there. This looks bad. Driving out there, he unexpectedly comes across Kate. She is in search of the graves from the Hutu refugee site. Kate asks Florence to help her find him. Kate will not be put off.Nkanga tells Florence that since Kate will not leave, he must take her to the graves she seeks and leave her there. He hands him a blade. “Runihura told us you would do anything to bury your past,” he tells the young Hutu. Florence does indeed take Kate to the grave. As she slithers into it, with Florence staring down, it occurs to her that she is in grave danger from her  angel. But no. He explains that he was paid to kill her, with a Rwandan passport but he must find his own way home. As he departs, however, villagers, aware of Kate’s death sentence gather with axes whereupon they attack the land, vigorously, digging for more graves.In a stadium in Rwanda, Runihura breaks the news to Bibi that the British want a deal, which will involve Alice returning to government and Bibi, if not stepping down, at least sharing power. They argue bitterly over economics but the sub-text is that Bibi feels betrayed by her one-time lover and, it turns out, father to daughter Mary. But the deal must happen: Alice is released to a crowd carrying “truth and reconciliation” banners – the truth on the tape will out. Back at his home, Runihura is startled by a cobra left there. It rears up. He could run but resignedly, he steps forward instead.Back in London, the news is broken to Ganimana that there is no more that can be done for his illness. Aware that this is the end of the road, he steps out into it and is run over by an ambulance. After decades of wrongdoing and evasion of justice, an abrupt end rather than the protracted one he would have faced in the courts. And now, a third man falls. Cries of unspeakable agony from a gurney. It’s Nkanga. Both his eyes have been put out, clearly the work of Florence, meting out to him double the treatment he applied to Picot.Alice meets with Mary in Switzerland, sitting over the waters it is a much friendlier encounter than their previous one. There are advantages in ceding power. Mother and daughter have each other back. As for Alice, she is in the front line again. Advised that Kromin’s mining operations are coming under attack from Ugandan jihadis, she instructs her assistant to call Sophie Barré, who has inherited her late father’s business interests. They can do business with her. The Great Game continues.Finally, a call between Michael and Kate, who despite her tone of arch distance has a profound emotional bond with the lawyer, something beyond mere daughter substitute or sexual attraction. She tells him he has kicked the pills he apologises for not having told the truth sooner but not too think unkindly of her mother. Before anything more intimate can be said, she puts down the phone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11e08b0934bb0f8593ff855e143c27d9116f5111/0_234_4831_2900/master/4831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cb6f20129b04ed986ffc43365cb9b97","title":"how did inside no 9 spring the biggest live tv surprise of the year","story":"Live episodes are often a painful, gimmicky exercise but Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith’s take on the format was one of 2018’s stand-out momentsFor the first five minutes at least, it looked thoroughly generic. Arthur Flitwick (Steve Pemberton) is back from the shops. He puts a mobile phone on the kitchen table, sticks Symphonic FM on and sets about coddling an egg. The phone rings, there is some sinister but indistinct white noise, the egg explodes in the microwave and the caller rings off. Flitwick redials the last number and what appears to be some vaguely underwhelming domestic farce involving a lost phone and a confused old lady begins to ensue.It is often said that in the age of Twitter and on-demand streaming, secrets are impossible to keep shocks are diffuse and signposted TV is no longer a communal experience. This autumn has presented two strong rebuttals to that idea. First, there was Jed Mercurio’s frantic drama Bodyguard. But last night, the truly audacious live special of Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith’s dark anthology comedy Inside No 9 went further still. You really did have to be there.From Flitwick’s phone call onwards, all bets were off. The arrival of Shearsmith’s vicar Reverend Neale saw the manifestation of the first gremlins: the sound disappeared and BBC Two’s continuity announcer intervened. Twitter collectively speculated about P45s on the way to the production crew and the show lost a fifth of its viewers as the less patient gave up the ghost. But the ghost was just getting started. A repeated (largely silent) episode of Inside No 9 began, but soon we were back in real time, in Pemberton and Shearsmith’s dressing room. Shearsmith flicked on the News at 10 where the green and gold flags of Jair Bolsonaro’s celebrating supporters could be glimpsed. Yes, this was actually happening, right now.This perfectly perplexing half hour of television has been in preparation for a while. The production team have been carefully seeding the show’s central conceit: the haunting of Granada studios. An article appeared in the Sun last week claiming that interventions from deceased Coronation Street stars had been making rehearsals impossible. But even so, what began to unfold was remarkable and unsettling. BBC Two itself appeared to be possessed, stricken by visitations from the studio’s illustrious and traumatic past. From Bobby Davro’s notorious faceplant during the filming of shiny-floor folly Public Enemy Number One to a serious fire during which costumes for The Jewel in The Crown were destroyed, we were suddenly scrolling through an index of Granada-based mishaps. Who knew where it would stop?Were people fooled? However much they might deny it now, yes they were. And actually, what fun to be so playfully toyed with by television to gaze at your screen and feel genuinely bewildered. But better yet, Shearsmith and Pemberton included us, made us participants. Shearsmith tweeted “Are me and Steve Pemberton on BBC two now?” and people replied. Viewers’ real time reactions became part of the spectacle in a way that felt more profound than usual, possibly because what we had seen had been confounding enough to make speculation unavoidable. Co-star Stephanie Cole’s Wikipedia entry was altered to reflect her sad, on-screen suicide as the possessed studio continued to work its dark magic.Event TV is a term that is now lazily applied to everything from cookery shows to talent contests. But the Inside No 9 live special really did deserve that description. It is now on BBC iPlayer and is well worth a second (or indeed, first) look. But if you weren’t there at 10pm on Sunday, you missed the essence of it. What the show demonstrated was that in the hands of true masters, modern media networks like Twitter are simply more tools, more colours a writer can add to their palette. The show’s closest relative is probably BBC One’s spectacular 1992 Halloween epic Ghostwatch. But Ghostwatch was able to take advantage of less jaded, less media-savvy, more credulous times. To even approach its mischief and magic in 2018 feels like a triumph of imagination. It also feels like a vindication of the idea that in the right hands, TV still has the capacity to surprise, disconcert and delight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd46e449882db63b9fbe6cc5cb5e6219373a0019/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfad84ce97d26d0b2c6aaa963fda12a3","title":"wisconsin scott walker rightwing republican young people","story":"Walker has undone Wisconsin’s progressive past and turned it into a lab for rightwing governance – but millennials have a different vision for the futureOutside the Chazen Art Museum on the campus of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, a shark, a banana and Nada Elmikashfi are trying to corral students to the polls for the first day of voting.Madison, the liberal heart and state capital of Wisconsin, is in the final stages of a squeakingly tight race to decide the political future of this once progressive state that is now deeply conservative – at least in terms of policy.Like many of the young voters on campus, Elmikashfi is determined to reverse the state’s decade-long lurch to the right. Beneath a cornflower blue sky Elmikashfi and two friends in fancy dress are handing out leaflets explaining why this midterm vote is so important. And why is it so vital to her? “I’m a black Muslim woman and an immigrant,” she says. “I am trying to reclaim my voice.”Wisconsin is in many ways emblematic of the deep ide roiling American politics. Since 2010 its union-busting governor, Scott Walker, has pursued small government, pro big-business policies that have undone Wisconsin’s progressive past and turned it into a laboratory for conservative governance. His policies have become a test bed for the Koch brothers and other rightwing billionaires – a model for their larger vision of America trotted out for others to copy at rightwing thinktanks across the country.Walker – according to tax-hating political advocate Grover Norquist – has been more influential in defeating the progressive agenda than Trump. If his policies are “enacted in a dozen more states, the modern Democratic party will cease to be a competitive power in American politics. It’s that big a deal,” he wrote last year.The governor seems to have been born hard right. At elementary school Walker started a “Jesus USA” club and at university he told a fellow student: “God told me I am chosen to cut taxes and stop killing babies.” His popularity is low these days and he’s trying to win people back with tweets about his everyman eating habits, but there’s no denying his effectiveness.Walker’s supporters won a major victory in 2016 when Donald Trump won the state – the first time Wisconsin had elected a Republican president since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Walker has worked tirelessly to disenfranchise voters and gerrymander Wisconsin into a shape that makes it easier for Republicans to win. If elected to a third term he could ensure the party’s dominance for a generation.Hillary Clinton, notoriously, hardly bothered to campaign in Wisconsin in 2016. This time the fight to stop Walker’s vision of the future has attracted top-tier talent. Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and rising stars like Kamala Harris have all been out supporting Walker’s opponent – Tony Evers, the state’s superintendent of education.But that legacy could – potentially – be Walker’s undoing. For millennial students, many voting for the first time, their first taste of politics was during the wave of strikes and protests that came after Walker rammed through Act 10 – legislation that stripped public school teachers of their right to collective bargaining and forced educators to contribute far more to their health insurance and pensions.The millennials were out in force in the Capitol Ballroom of the Madison Concourse Hotel last weekend at a rally for the Democratic senator Tammy Baldwin, currently running comfortably out in front for re-election against Leah Vukmir, a Wisconsin senator with close ties to the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec).“I’ve grown up with Scott Walker and seen how things have gotten worse,” said Sigal Felber, a student at the University of Wisconsin. “School funding, potholes, concealed-carry signs. He’s not for the people, he’s for the Republicans.” Felber is 20 and has voted in every election she has been qualified to vote in. It’s not typical of young voters, who often tend to miss the polls, but she says she thinks that is changing.Her friend and fellow student Laura Livermore, 19, agreed. She has voted in previous primaries and even for supreme court justices. “I think people are tired of this. We want change,” she said.The hollowing out of the unions and Walker’s spending cuts have fundamentally changed Wisconsin. It’s a historic shift documented in Dan Kaufman’s new book The Fall of Wisconsin: The Conservative Conquest of a Progressive Bastion and the Future of American Politics.Under Walker Wisconsin has witnessed one of the largest declines in its middle class of any state. Its poverty rate is at a 30-year high and its roads are the second worst in the union – locals refer to “Scottholes”.Kaufman argues that Walker’s success in beating the unions effectively paved the way for Trump, hitting the pockets of the unions, the only group powerful enough to take on the massive amounts of corporate, rightwing money now pouring into races across the country. “There’s a lot of interest in the book across the midwest,” Kaufman said. “A lot of things that have happened there are happening here.” In regions that handed the presidency to Trump.The polling suggests Walker is in the fight of his life. Evers currently has a slight lead, according to Real Clear Politics, but it’s too close to call, and writing off a campaigner as skilled as Walker would be a mistake.In Oak Creek near Milwaukee, Republican Bryan Steil is running for the seat being vacated by the House speaker, Paul Ryan, in a vicious and closely fought race with the ironworker and rising Democratic star Randy Bryce. The candidates’ attitudes towards Israel was the top priority for Vernon Engstrom, a 51-year-old automotive worker who supports Steil. He doesn’t like Trump’s style but supports his policies. “I am a Christian and he’s supportive of Christians. Trump does seem to be doing what he said he’d do,” he said,Another supporter who would only give her first name, Carol, and age, 68, hissed with anger at the “mess” she said Barack Obama had left. “We have suffered eight years of the worst policies. The economy was so bad. It was all such a mess,” she said, before submitting a question to the candidates about their attitudes to later-term abortions.Tommy Thompson, former Republican governor of Wisconsin, said the state had always been politically ided.What he says has changed is the viciousness of the debate. Thompson, the longest-serving governor in the state’s history, is currently appearing in ads for Walker. Tellingly, Walker’s ads often use surrogates – he clearly knows how many people feel about him. Locals say it’s the first time Thompson has done ads for Walker but Thompson said “he can’t remember”.“He should have used me before, I am very popular,” he said. It’s certainly one of the most gentle ads bombarding Wisconsinites, none of the accusations of “plagiarism” or attacks from family members that feature in other ads.What disappoints Thompson about the current race is just how angry the state has become. “I think people have had enough. The pushing and shoving, the shouting – from both sides. This is not America.” After the race is over, he hopes, people will come together. “It’s time for us to set our anger aside,” he says. It’s a nice thought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d2dc2bbf9bc2b0ad871dc1f36b62995a4ca730e/0_403_4943_2965/master/4943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e786d16021476e81de1ac73982aa933a","title":"angela merkel to step down vacuum eu politics","story":"Europe’s political stability is at greater risk than at any time since second world warWhen Angela Merkel first came into office in 2005, George W Bush was in the White House, Tony Blair was British prime minister, and the Elysée Palace was occupied by Jacques Chirac.The German chancellor’s announcement on Monday that she would not seek re-election as head of her ruling centre-right CDU party and that her fourth term as chancellor would be her last, heralds the end of an era in which she has dominated German and European politics.Merkel has been a symbol of steadiness and continuity. The departure of the EU’s de facto leader before Germany’s next federal elections – due in 2021 – comes as the continent’s political stability and consensus are arguably at greater risk than at any time since the end of the second world war.After months of fraught negotiations, Merkel’s damaged conservatives renewed a weakened and unpopular coalition with their traditional centre-left rivals, the Social Democratic party (SPD). In an ever more fragmented European political landscape, both are now paying the price as voters turn their backs on the traditional parties of government.Held together more by a fear of the alternative – and, in particular, the further rise of the far-right AfD – than by any driving policy ambitions, the governing alliance in Berlin lacks clear, bold ideas and the courage to implement them, creating an increasingly untenable leadership vacuum that voters have punished.Merkel’s move was not, then, entirely unexpected. She has decided that governing one hard-fought compromise at a time, clinging on after elections that were defeats but not quite disasters, is doing more harm than good – and it would be better to remove herself from the electoral equation.But the loss of a chancellor whose cautious blend of principle and pragmatism guided her country and the EU through the 2008 financial crash and ensuing eurozone crisis, the Arab spring, Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and Europe’s migration crisis will still leave a chasm to be filled.While applauded for its humanity, many see her bold decision in 2015 to open Germany’s borders to about a million refugees, mostly Muslims fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East and beyond, as having speeded her departure, diminishing her authority, iding her party, her country and its European partners, and boosting support for anti-immigrant parties.At home, all eyes will will be focused on whether Merkel can manage to stage a smooth exit. In theory, her announcement that she will not be standing again for the party’s leadership at its conference in December should – while she remains chancellor – allow a new CDU chair to build a strong electoral profile before 2021.But events may well intervene. Merkel is under heavy pressure from her ailing SPD partners to deliver more policy results. The centre-left party, whose vote share has plummeted to an all-time low, could yet pull out of the coalition government during a midterm review next year.That would trigger federal elections and an earlier-than-planned departure for Germany’s first female chancellor. Two of her CDU predecessors as head of government, Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, both failed signally to ensure an untroubled succession.Even if Merkel avoids a messy end to her political career, the CDU’s attention will necessarily be on putting its own house in order and finding a successor able and willing to step into Merkel’s shoes. The government, likewise, will be seeking domestic progress faced with the advances not just of the AfD, but the pro-EU, refugee-welcoming Greens.The chancellor’s weakness at home could well limit her capacity to lead – or at least, provide stability – in the EU at a time when the bloc is dealing with Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist parties making big gains in the European parliament elections next May.This is bad news mainly for the French president, Emmanuel Macron, whose big visions of eurozone reform now look further from being realised than ever. It will not, however, herald any major changes in Germany’s policy towards the bloc – or to Brexit.Senior UK officials and politicians had long predicted Merkel would step in close to the end of Brexit talks to secure a deal that Theresa May could sell to parliament. That was never very likely – but even if it had been, with her leadership now time-limited, Merkel’s leverage to fix results has been hugely weakened.More significantly, EU diplomats note that neither Merkel nor Macron can afford to offer the UK any succour in the negotiations.With European elections due next May, the onus for the powerful Franco-German alliance will be on maintaining a tough, principled approach that illustrates clearly the benefits of EU membership and the grave risks to an economy of leaving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b83c441387eb4e32b8f54f487c1d7e2d012538b3/191_30_1870_1122/master/1870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e7a4e0236ae6932c515677071bb3478","title":"the remains of stalin gulag railroad soviet union a photo essay","story":"In Russia’s Arctic wilderness, the remnants of one of the Soviet Union’s most notorious gulag projects lie largely forgottenFrom 1947 until 1953, tens of thousands of prisoners, many of them “politicals” convicted for “anti-Soviet acts”, were shipped to northern Russia to lay a railroad through some of the harshest terrain on Earth.The railroad would have connected Russia’s Arctic waters with its western railway network.Most records relating to the gulags, the brutal network of forced-labour camps for dissenters, criminals, and other perceived threats, remain secret. But it is likely that Stalin, spooked by the incursion of Nazi submarines into the Arctic during the second world war, wanted the railway in place as a means of supplying a planned naval port. The railway also would have connected northern nickel mines to Soviet factories in the west.But just days after Stalin’s death in 1953, the project was cancelled amid the subsequent Soviet “thaw”. Since then, the railway’s gulag camps have lain abandoned, sinking further into the forest under the weight of each winter’s snow. Getting to the camps today is difficult outside of winter, with most lying beyond terrain that would bog a tank.Only specialised vehicles, like this balloon-tyred Trekol in which Chapple travelled, are able to move through the swampy region where the railroad was laid.But the biggest threat to survival, according to another former prisoner, came from the brutal winters, which frequently dropped below -40C (-40F).Prisoners were kept ided in gendered barracks. One survivor, Alexandr Snovsky, says the men would throw letters into the female zone to communicate in secret.Some remains, such as this shack that probably housed guards, have been maintained and are regularly used by hunters.Most engineers engaged on the railway were free workers, while the heavy labour was carried out by prisoners. Most of the railway, as evidenced by this old signal marker, has fallen into ruin.For Snovsky, who now lives with his wife near St Petersburg, the biggest tragedy was the project’s futility: “Tens of thousands of human lives for nothing. For me, the saddest thing was that it was for nothing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c745188f1cb0c82a36985cbd2a8a8bf83a2f623b/0_118_5132_3078/master/5132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c344dcaf947d3362739ceca0b48b2c6e","title":"canada glaciers yukon shrinking","story":"Glaciers in the Yukon territory are retreating even faster than expected in a warming climate, scientists warnScientists in Canada have warned that massive glaciers in the Yukon territory are shrinking even faster than would be expected from a warming climate – and bringing dramatic changes to the region.After a string of recent reports chronicling the demise of the ice fields, researchers hope that greater awareness will help the public better understand the rapid pace of climate change.The rate of warming in the north is double that of the average global temperature increase, concluded the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its annual Arctic Report Card, which called the warming “unprecedented”.“The region is one of the hotspots for warming, which is something we’ve come to realize over the last 15 years,” said David Hik of Simon Fraser University. “The magnitude of the changes is dramatic.”In their recent State of the Mountains report published earlier in the summer, the Canadian Alpine Club found that the Saint Elias mountains – which  British Columbia, the Yukon and Alaska – are losing ice faster than the rest of the country.“When I first went to the St Elias range, it felt like time travel – into the past,” said Hik, who co-edited the report. “What we’re seeing now feels like time travel into the future. Because as the massive glaciers are retreating, they’re causing a complete reorganization of the environment.”The accelerating melt of the glacier has resulted in major shifts to water sources at lower elevations.In 2016, the meltwaters of the glacier shifted dramatically away from the Slims river, cutting off critical water supplies to Kluane Lake – a Unesco world heritage site. Since the ersion, water levels at the lake have dropped more than 6.6ft – stranding thousands of fish from their natural spawning rivers. Dust storms have begun to flare up along sections of the well-travelled Alaska Highway – at times halting traffic, the result of a dry river bed covered in glacial silt. The events at Kluane Lake are a precursor of what can be expected elsewhere, said Hik.The dramatic changes to the landscape come amid predictions that the Arctic region is slated to experience far quicker – and potentially devastating –warming in the coming years.In the St Elias range, researchers have found warming intensifies at higher altitudes – a phenomenon they are not quite able to explain.Earlier this year, Canada’s auditor general found that none of the three northern territories were adequately prepared for the impacts of climate change.But Robinson and Hik cautioned against an overly pessimistic view of the rapidly changing ecosystem.“Never before in human history have mountains been revered as they are today. Mountains are landscapes people adore – and with awareness, real change can be affected,” said Robinson.“When we have a an opportunity for early warning, we might as well take it,” said Hik."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab9df8f0c24c6261485e52b9c952c26ba4e875b4/4_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6d0c7b4ecc2e50ac5da5d9054d4ddb9","title":"new zealand earthquake 62 magnitude shake halts parliament","story":"Houses sway as strong quake under central New Zealand is felt in WellingtonA 6.2-magnitude earthquake has struck central New Zealand, causing parliament to be suspended.The quake was felt most strongly in central New Zealand, including the capital city of Wellington. It struck at a depth of 207 kilometres south-west of Taumarunui.There were no immediate reports of serious damage or injury. People near the epicentre reported their houses swaying and pictures falling off walls.Parliament’s deputy speaker Anne Tolley made the snap decision to suspend parliament when violent shaking interrupted the speech of an MP.“I never thought I’d have to do that, suspend the House until we find out what’s happened,” Tolley said.“There were public in the galleries and people need to just make sure their staff are OK. We’re in the safest building probably in the country – but just to make sure and get some advice.”GNS Science, the country’s earthquake monitoring body, said the quake was widely felt around the country and lasted a long time. There was no tsunami threat but people needed to take care during the aftershocks, the agency said.The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, used Twitter to urge New Zealanders to check on each other’s welfare.Civil Defence Minister Kris Fa’afoi said civil emergency groups were actively checking the country for damage but there had been no reports of anything “major”, nor injuries or fatalities.The quake struck at 3.13pm local time and GeoNet has so far reported more than 15,000 ‘felt’ reports, with the strongest shaking reported in Wellington, Christchurch and Nelson.Geonet reported “moderate” shaking in Auckland, where the royal couple are spending the day for a public walkabout in the Viaduct Harbour.A spokeswoman for Internal Affairs who was travelling with the couple said the quake was not felt in Auckland and the couple “didn’t feel it”.Fa’afoi said the shake would have given New Zealanders a decent scare, and Anne Tolley made the right call to suspend parliament and evacuate the house.“She chose the wise thing to do... we felt it quite heavily in the house.”Fa’afoi reiterated the prime minister’s earlier message and asked New Zealanders to look out for their neighbours and community, as the country could feel on edge for a number of days.“People might be a little nervy, and that’s understandable.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3679782.1540835170!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"number of refused british applications for irish passports rises dramatically","story":"Speaking at meeting of foreign ministers in mid-October in Luxembourg, Tánaiste Simon Coveney called on the British government to follow through on commitments made in Brexit talks.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe number of applications from UK residents seeking Irish passports since Britain voted to leave the EU being turned down has risen dramatically.Passport applications from British residents being refused have soared from just one refusal in 2016 to at least 15,074 last year, according to latest figures.Overall hundreds of thousands of UK residents have applied for Irish passports since Britain voted for Brexit and the rate of applications continues to increase.The rise in requests for Irish passports from Northern Ireland is even greater than from Britain.Worldwide, the number of applications for Irish passports received from outside the State surged from 190,905 in 2016 to 227,223 last year and up to the end of September this year had hit 191,271, according to figures released to Social Democrat TD Catherine Murphy.Statistics supplied to Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond by the Irish Embassy in London show that the number of passport applications from the UK has risen significantly since the year before the Brexit vote.In 2015 there were almost 99,944 applications from Britain and Northern Ireland, a figure that rose to 131,035 the following year.In 2017 there was a further increase of over 30,000 applications to 163,026.And figures this year to the end of May show 91,860 applications were made.The number of people from the North who applied to the Irish Embassy in London for an Irish passport rose from 53,715 in 2015 to 67,582 the following year.Applications jumped again last year to 82,274 and up to the end of May this year 46,898 people in the North applied for Irish passports.“Embassy officials predict that based on this, 2018 will be the busiest year so far for Irish passport applications in the UK,” Mr Richmond said.People born to Irish parents or grandparents are entitled to apply for an Irish passport through a claim to citizenship.“At least 10 per cent of the UK’s population, not including Northern Ireland, are estimated to qualify for an Irish passport and in light of Brexit” many were “staking their claim” to the passport, Mr Richmond said.Tánaiste Simon Coveney told Ms Murphy in a parliamentary reply that the passport service did not compile data on the number of passport applications refused.However, Mr Coveney told her that in 2016 a total of 63,452 passports were issued by the Irish Embassy in London, one fewer than the number of applications diplomats told Mr Richmond it had received from Britain.The Tánaiste also said 65,678 Irish passports were issued through the embassy last year, some 15,074 less than the 80,752 applications from British residents.Mr Coveney pointed out that the passport service “must be satisfied as to the identity of the applicant and that the applicant is an Irish citizen”.Mr Richmond said that “while many in the UK are concerned with the looming disaster of Brexit, we must seize the positives from this new wave of people reconnecting with their Irish heritage, our post-Brexit UK-Irish relations can be built on a strong, connected diaspora”.In contrast, applications from the Irish diaspora elsewhere around the world have dropped slightly.Ms Murphy noted that the number of applications has fallen annually since 2016 in locations with significant Irish populations including New York, San Francisco and Boston in the US although there has been an increase in applications to the Chicago consulate from 1,126 in 2016 to 2,046 last year and 1,435 up to the end of September this year.Applications outside the EU are also falling including those from Canada, New Zealand, Australia, United Arab Emirates, China and Japan.In Africa, applications from Nigeria, Mozambique, Uganda, and Tanzania have also fallen.

Photograph: PASARAH BURNS and VIVIENNE CLARKEThe leader of Renua has said the party is going to reach out to Peter Casey in the coming days about joining the party. However, Councillor John Leahy, Renua’s sole elected public representative said he would not stand in the way of Mr Casey taking over his party.Renua was founded by former minister of state for European affairs Lucinda Creighton in 2015. She lost her Dáil seat in the 2016 General Election, having forfeited both her ministerial office and parliamentary party membership when she defied Fine Gael on abortion legislation in July 2013. Mr Leahy said he had secured the contact details of the Derry businessman and hopes to meet him. “I think Peter is very much in line to our way of thinking in terms of a lot of our core policies. Taxpayer first, entrepreneurship, and law and order would be three of our six pillars,” Mr Leahy said.Mr Casey finished second in the presidential race, securing 23 per cent of first preference votes, following a series of controversial comments on the travelling community. Mr Leahy said the leadership of his party is “open to be contested”. “It’s not a closed shop in Renua, we’re a small, growing party so from that point of view I’ve no problem with anybody stepping up to the mark that thinks they can take up the leadership and drive the party forward.”Mr Casey said on Monday that if Fianna Fáil did not want him as a member he would set up a new party called New Fianna Fáil. Meanwhile, Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman Sean Fleming has said that Fianna Fáil is a democratic party, not a business that someone can “move in and take over the top job.”Mr Fleming told Newstalk Breakfast that none of the main political parties is a business that can be taken over by a person. Such an approach and language was for business, “politics doesn’t work that way.”Fianna Fáil will have to look at the 340,000 people who had voted for Peter Casey, Mr Fleming said. “There was a vacuum here. I’m quite sure had there been someone standing for the main political parties, those 340,000 would not have voted for Peter Casey.”He defended the party’s decision not to run a candidate in the presidential election. “Micheál Martin made a clear decision. Michael D was doing an excellent job and from that point of view that was a correct decision.”Mr Fleming also defended the PAC’s decision to examine Áras spending every year. This was not a reflection on the President, he said. There are “lots of issues that need to be dealt with.”Senior civil servants will be asked to account for the money that is being spent in the Áras and on the office of the President. The PAC did not “step over the line. We should have been doing this every year.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3679873.1540855000!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"angela merkel s withdrawal adds insecurity to europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman chancellor and leader of the CDU Angela Merkel will not stand again as leader and will step down as chancellor in 2021. Photograph: Markus HeineGettyFrom Kohl’s Mädchen to Eurocrisis Madame Non, Angela Merkel has always been defined from outside, usually by men. But when Europe’s most powerful woman since Margaret Thatcher announced her political departure by degrees on Monday, it was her belated attempt to define her legacy while boosting her increasingly torpid party.The source of their torpor: apart from winning elections , senior party figures in Berlin struggle to explain for what, exactly, the Merkel CDU stands.Answering that question requires answering another: for what, exactly, does Angela Merkel stand? Stabilising Europe and defending the multilateral order are all well and good but, at home, German voters are increasingly wary of the CDU and its leader of 18 years.From a near-absolute majority in 2013, her party suffered a historic disaster in last year’s federal election. Tortuous talks yielded her a fourth term but an equally tortured third grand coalition with Germany’s big two centrist parties are shedding support at an alarming rate to the political fringes.The first alarm bell came earlier this month when frustrated CDU backbenchers ousted Dr Merkel’s trusted parliamentary party leader for their own man in the Bundestag. Two regional election disasters in two weeks – which polling analysts registered as a protest for one in two voters – made the decline impossible to ignore any longer.Ahead of the next scheduled federal election in 2021, the party of Adenauer and Kohl now faces a choice: continue Merkel’s centrist approach or shiftexpand more to the right to neutralise the populist, far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).Between now and December’s CDU party conference, three, possibly four, candidates will present their visions for the future.Two are Merkel loyalists and two unquestioned Merkel rivals. As CDU general secretary and former regional premier Anngret Kramp-Karrenbauer – AKK to her supporters – is Merkel’s chosen successor. If her politics – socially conservative, economic liberal – or Merkel proximity prove a problem, another Merkel-friendly candidate may enter the ring: Armin Laschet, state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia.A centrist figure, he has yet to declare but enjoys strong backing as head of Germany’s most populous state.Their conciliatory, constructive stance towards Merkel may work in their favour, given Merkel intends to stay on as chancellor.But that proximity could prove more hindrance than help in the face-off with the other would-be challengers. Jen Spahn, the impatient, ambitious health minister, plays to the CDU’s neglected conservative base and, at 38, represents a generational shift.But he may have met his match in Friedrich Merz, sidelined by Merkel as her deputy in 2002 and mourned ever since as the CDU’s best man who got away.Merz, a trained lawyer, Atlanticist and fiscal conservative, signalled on Monday his readiness to enter the race, reviving a legendary feud with Merkel and challenging her insistence (as late as two weeks ago) that chancellorship and party leadership belong in one pair of hands.Depending on how revolutionary they are feeling, CDU delegates could back Merz, burst Merkel’s co-habitation bubble and – in the most extreme scenario – sideline her entirely.As would-be candidates begin running numbers and testing regional party loyalties, Angela Merkel can begin ordering her legacy.She profited from reform efforts of her predecessor, SPD chancellor Gerhard Schröder, and steered Germany relatively unscathed through the banking and euro crises. But the latter’s legacy undermined trust of many CDU conservatives in the European project and confirmed their worst doubts about euro no-bailout promises.Merkel doubters who didn’t leave the CDU then for the new AfD had a second opportunity in the 2015-2016 migration crisis, when more than one million people entered Germany. One half of Germany saw in this Merkel’s finest hour as a humanitarian, later hobbled by hardline European neighbours. But critics pointed to the series of asylum seeker attacks that followed and argued the poorly communicated refugee challenge exposed the fatal limitations of Merkel’s drive-by-sight political style.Always at her most effective as a presidential, above-the-fray figure, this may serve her well in the months ahead – particularly as Brexit talks enter their crunch phase.None of her potential successors have indicated any notable deviation from Merkel’s strategy to date: no Berlin solo runs, deference to Brussels negotiators and full backing for Dublin.But breaking in a new CDU leader is a distraction and a new element of insecurity in European politics, as if Brexit hadn’t already provided enough moving parts.

Photograph:  Omer MessingerEPAThe race has begun to succeed Germany’s Angela Merkel as chair of her centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) after she announced her decision to stand down in December after 18 years.Dr Merkel said on Monday she intended to stay on as chancellor – a role she described as a “daily honour and challenge” – until her fourth-term ends in 2021. But she admitted dissatisfaction with her grand coalition’s “unacceptable” performance after a year in office.“I am certain the time has come to open a new chapter,” said Dr Merkel (64) at lunchtime on Monday. As well as her decision to stand down as CDU leader, she confirmed that her fourth term as chancellor would be her last and that she was not interested in any further political role. “I once said I was not born as chancellor, and that is something I have never forgotten.”Dr Merkel said she had decided to stand down as party leader over the summer but had brought forward the announcement after her party scored another disastrous result in a regional election on Sunday.Amid growing political pressure, Dr Merkel decided to take what she described as a “big risk“: to separate the roles of chancellor and party leader she believes belong together. Two candidates have announced their interest in succeeding her, with two more considering a leadership bid.Dr Merkel’s announcement earned a largely positive reaction at home and abroad.French president Emmanuel Macron, waiting over a year for a substantial Berlin response to his EU reform proposals, described Dr Merkel’s decision as “extremely dignified”.Her Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners, after another historic election disaster at the weekend, insisted Dr Merkel’s decision would have no effect on the federal government in Berlin.Amid growing voter dissatisfaction, however, on everything from housing to looming diesel bans, it is far from certain if this government will hold for three more years.Happiest of all on Monday were the opposition, far-right Alternative für Deutschland. Its leaders claimed their election night promise last year, to “hunt down” mainstream political parties, had, in Dr Merkel, claimed its first victim.Next month, just five days after the CDU elects a new leader, the German chancellor, as head of government, is scheduled to attend a crunch EU summit on Brexit.Monday’s decision is the beginning of the end of a career that began in 1990 when Dr Merkel, an East German-raised physicist, entered politics and was promoted immediately to Helmut Kohl’s cabinet table.After he lost power in 1998, and dragged the CDU into an illegal political donations scandal, Dr Merkel was the first to distance herself from her mentor to seize the party leadership in 2000.After a narrow election win in 2005 she formed a grand coalition, only the second in post-war history. Now on her third such coalition in four terms, she lead Germany in the euro crisis to unprecedented political influence in Brussels."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177653497_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc legal correspondent wrong say nda signed freely","story":"BBC legal correspondent criticised for saying NDA was signed freely Court of AppealThe BBC has been told it is “inaccurate” to claim that women who entered into non-disclosure agreements after they had made allegations about sexual harassment did so “freely”.Media and employment lawyers have said it is likely there would be an “imbalance of power” during negotiations to settle a claim and therefore it was incorrect to view these contractual relationships as free of “abuse”.Yesterday, a BBC journalist claimed the judgment by the Court of Appeal “made clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure”.

works. Bitcoins can only come into existence if a computer “mines” them, which means the computer must solve complex math equations, sucking up electricity. Part of the economic draw of Bitcoin is that it cannot be produced easily or cheaply, meaning it is unlikely that it will be mined so quickly that it loses value. There is also a cap on Bitcoin production: there will only be 21 million in total.Mining one bitcoin “could take as much energy in that transaction to power your house for months”, said Jon Truby, Director of the Centre for Law and Development at Qatar University. “Right now, that’s not sustainable.”It is hard to predict the future of Bitcoin: it is highly volatile and is sometimes worth less than the amount of money it costs to mine. The difficulty of the equation that the computer has to solve can also make mining bitcoins take more energy. Many economists suggests that the value will increase, and it is possible that technology could also improve mining efficiency in the future. Some argue that cash is also environmentally destructive.Alternatively, maybe mining Bitcoins will eventually become more efficient and use less energy. “The mining efficiency has been improving quite a lot,” Camilo Mora, lead author of the study, said. “That is because you make more money there. That is something that the mining companies have tried to push hard.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescue team members collecting the remains of the crashed plane at Tanjung Priok Harbour, Indonesia.

Of these, only a handful have actually managed to have any significant impact, and none have managed to reach the same heights as bitcoin. But some analysts believe this is about to change.Nigel Green, founder and CEO of UK-based financial consultancy firm\u0026nbspdeVere Group, forecasts bitcoin will soon face strong competition within a booming cryptocurrency industry.“Bitcoin is what kickstarted the crypto revolution and it has changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets, amongst other things, forever.\u0026nbsp It all began with bitcoin, he said.“However, I believe that bitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade.\u0026nbspThis is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organisations in both the private and the public sectors.

As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, having seen a 2,000 per cent price increase in 2017 followed by a 65 per cent decrease so far in 2018.\u0026nbspSince early September, however, bitcoin has traded consistently at around $6,500, only ever fluctuating by a few hundred dollars.This trend has been helped by a lack of destabilising news in the cryptocurrency space, together with broader consensus on how to address some of the technological\u0026nbspchallenges facing bitcoin.stabilized in recent months (CoinMarketCap)Should such a trend continue, cryptocurrency expert Iqbal Gandham, who works for the online trading platform\u0026nbspeToro, believes the price of bitcoin will see steady gains over the coming years.Elon Musk posts bizarre bitcoin tweet about cryptocurrency scamsBitcoin has shown great resilience over the past decade.

As with any startup idea, early days are always risky, but I feel these are now few and far between.$10,000 by the end of NovemberA new tool that forecasts the future of 15 leading investment choices puts bitcoin on a strong upward trajectory over the coming month.Using an algorithm to chart the market performance of cryptocurrencies, commodities and companies, How Rich Would You Be?\u0026nbspforecasts bitcoin to hit $10,104 by November 18 – a 60 per cent increase from today\u0027s price.Such a dramatic gain most likely reflects the huge price surge experienced by bitcoin in the final months of 2017, where its value rose from $6,000 to $20,000 between early November and late December.The biggest short-term gains, however, are expected to come from other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash and ethereum.Using the same price prediction tool, ethereum\u0026nbspis forecast to rocket by 282 per cent by mid-November, taking its value up above $750.The future predictions reveal that the cryptocurrencies will experience the highest percentage increase, yielding more profit than commodities or companies, a spokesperson for the tool said in an email to\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspDespite the unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market, the historical data shows that, when compared against commodity and company investments, EOS, Bitcoin and Ripple boast three of the top five investments.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s\u0026nbsptime to change that to Dreaming Phil.Hammond’s dream is that his Government will somehow find a way of securing a Brexit deal that it can get through Parliament. If it can, his latest budget will count for something. If not we’ll be back here again in April, a\u0026nbsppossibility he alluded to in his speech.\u0026nbspAccording to the bookies he clobbered with an increase in the remote gaming levy, it’s still a toss up.\u0026nbspHammond’s Budget was anti-business and anti-opportunityChancellor ploughs extra £1bn into troubled universal creditHammond takes aim at Amazon, Google and Facebook with new tech taxThe Chancellor indulged in the usual waffle about building a new relationship with the EU we’ve come to expect from ministers.\u0026nbspBut he chucked a few extra hundred million on to rapidly growing contingency planning pile, acknowledging that the worst is becoming a distinct possibility.\u0026nbspAnd if that happens, “the strivers, the grafters and the carers” the “people who ask only of government that we protect the jobs that put food on their table” and look after the “public services that they rely on”\u0026nbsp are going to have some hard questions for him, such as “what did you do to prevent this other than issue warnings so you could say I told you so”.\u0026nbspEven if a deal is done, and his\u0026nbsp”double deal idend”\u0026nbspbudget stands, the forecasts are\u0026nbsphardly rosy.\u0026nbspPrime Minister Theresa May said austerity is over. The Chancellor’s formulation was a mite more cautious. It is, he said, “coming to an end”.\u0026nbspThat’s understandable given the outlook he faces. This year the economy is set to\u0026nbspgrow by just 1.3 per cent, if\u0026nbspthe Office for\u0026nbspBudgetary Responsibility has it right.\u0026nbspIts assessment of UK plc’s potential further out has improved\u0026nbspa bit but we’ll still be averaging growth of only 1.5 per cent.\u0026nbspIn its view, Britain will be stuck in the slow lane for the foreseeable future, even with the benefit of the fiscal loosening the Chancellor is planning. All his talk of ambition and the bright future for the “indomitable” British people\u0026nbspwon’t change that.\u0026nbspIn the meantime he confirmed that there will be some bones thrown and some sticking plasters applied. The NHS will get its extra money, but when set against what it needs\u0026nbspit’s only the bare minimum. There’ll be a few less potholes in the roads, thanks to the £400m or so set aside to fix them, a bit extra support for those facing the nightmare of Universal Credit. That carbuncle, a project that is turning into the Poll Tax for this generation of Tories, is here to stay, he declared. That may come back to haunt him.\u0026nbspThe Tories’ traditional supporters will cheer his bringing forward a tax cut, which is what the changes to the personal allowance and the top rate threshold planned for 2019 amount to.\u0026nbspAnd while Boris Johnson might have said ‘f- business’, the Chancellor wants to be its friend.\u0026nbspThe Institute of Directors, for one, gave its thumbs up to business rate relief for small firms, cuts to their apprenticeship levy, investment incentives, more funding for City deals.\u0026nbsp“But will there be support for SME Brexit planning,” it said archly, while criticising the Chancellor for “pulling his\u0026nbsppunches”.\u0026nbspThere were some good bits the commitment to end the private finance initiative in particular. The narrowly targeted digital services tax (aimed at Facebook, Google and their silicon valley pals) even looked bold, until the critics got their teeth into the details. The £400m it will supposedly raise is ho hum indeed.\u0026nbspIn his opening Hammond talked about the concerns of the people away from the Westminster bubble, who care about putting food on the table, clothing their children, running their lives.\u0026nbspHe boasted of the strongest wage growth in a decade, and the sustained real wage growth forecast for each of the next five years, that ought to\u0026nbspmake life better for them.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The launch of the Finney phone will be taking place on Thursday, 29 November, in Barcelona.Sirin Labs)Sirin\u0026nbspLabs announced Lionel Messi as its brand ambassador last December, explaining in a subsequent blog post\u0026nbsphe is acting as more than just a celebrity endorser.“A brand ambassador is someone who recognises the significance of a company and agrees to represent that company in a professional manner, educate others about it, and bring awareness to it,” the post stated.Sirin Labs landed footballing superstar Lionel Messi as a partner in 2017 (Sirin Labs)“This is the relationship we have with Leo Messi. After a significant amount of time discussing a wide range of issues, Messi saw the power, professionalism and future within Sirin\u0026nbspLabs, and it was for these reasons he agreed to represent us to the masses.”Given the fact some celebrity backers of cryptocurrency-related products have resulted in scams, Sirin\u0026nbspLabs was keen to stress that this is not the case with Messi.“If you’ve followed Messi’s career at all, you’d know he doesn’t just put his name on anything to make a buck,” the post continued.\u0026nbsp“As the Greatest of All Time (GOAT) in the most popular sport in the world, you can imagine the type of vetting process that he and his team have to ensure they’re not going to associate with something criminal, illicit, or anything that might tarnish his stellar brand.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Because the company has managed to slice off some more of the bezel around the display, it is the biggest screen in a OnePlus phone but takes up less space on the front.OnePlus forced to change 6T release date because of Apple eventThe biggest new breakthrough is probably the Screen Unlock feature. That works like the fingerprint sensor on many other phones – but it is placed right beneath the screen. OnePlus\u0026nbspsaid it will be able to unlock in just 0.34 seconds, despite being hidden.As well as that feature, it includes a new processor, RAM boost and special software that the company claims will speed up apps. It also has a battery that provides a 20 per cent increase on the OnePlus 6, which can use its fast charging feature.The camera is also improved to include features such as Nightscape, which it claims can take much improved pictures in the dark.OnePlus hopes the latest phone can finally allow it to break into the mainstream. Alongside updates to the phones, it will also be available more widely than ever before, as exclusivity deals have been lifted to allow it to be sold on different networks and shops.The cheapest version of the phone will be sold for £499, with the price increasing to £579 for extra storage space.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

CEO Jack Dorsey said he did not like it and it would disappear soon, the report claims.Twitter \u0027deeply sorry\u0027 for failing to act on threat from Cesar SayocNow Twitter has said the button is being reconsidered and that it is possible that it could disappear in the future.As we\u0027ve been saying for a while, we are rethinking everything about the service to ensure we are incentivizing healthy conversation, that includes the like button, it wrote in a tweet that quoted the \u0027s report. We are in the early stages of the work and have no plans to share right now.Brandon Borrmann, who works in communications at Twitter, said specifically that claims it would happen anytime soon were wrong – but that it could be happening in the future.We\u0027ve been open that we\u0027re considering it, he tweeted. Jack even mentioned it in front of the US Congress. There\u0027s no timeline.

People including Kanye West have suggested that those numbers should be hidden entirely – a move that Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspdid not seem to reject.But it has been repeatedly criticised for failing to address some of its more central problems, including from users who believe it should be acting to ban people from the platform rather than\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was in complete bad taste and was not funny nor entertaining.\u0026nbsp“The police have confirmed that they are treating this as a hate crime and rightly so. Nobody within our community should live in fear or intimidation from a group of people who through this action have offered nothing but that.\u0026nbsp“The Muslim community are contributing much to society in Northern Ireland. Everyone has the right to live here.

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In those circumstances, I suggested the EU should begin preparatory work on the extension of Article 50.“Because what would not be a good thing in my view is if we managed to get a referendum but it was too late because we had left the EU or the EU had not made preparations for an Article 50 extension.”Mr Khan added: “Whatever Theresa May brings back will probably be rejected by cabinet, almost certainly rejected by the party, and if not will definitely be rejected by parliament.“That’s why I said to Michel Barnier: listen, you need to start preparing for the possibility of extending Article 50 because if that is the case we will need time to have a referendum.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, tough times are far from over.”It warned that, after other spending protections for defence and foreign aid, the plan\u0026nbsp“probably means more cuts for other departments”.And the Child Poverty Action Group seized on the failure to end the four-year freeze on family benefits – cuts in real terms – as proof there was no “substance to the claim that austerity is over”.Created with Sketch.Tories at war: Boris Johnson \u0027suicide vest\u0027 Brexit jibe causes ide Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Internal isions in the Conservative Party have exploded into a bitter public row over Boris Johnson‘s “disgusting” criticism of Theresa May.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, rebuked his former cabinet colleague and said: “I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences.”But other MPs leapt to Mr Johnson’s defence, as iding lines ahead of a possible leadership contest begin to take shape.

What we are preparing for is Britain\u0027s future.Philip Hammond has been all over the airwaves this morning, defending yesterday\u0027s Budget, which seems to have received a pretty positive response from many papers.Here\u0027s some highlights:He told the Today programme that the deficit will decline in every year of the forecast period, and he retained an ambition to balance the budget.Asked if some government departments faced cuts in the coming years, Mr Hammond said: The overall envelope of funding that\u0027s available in the spending review, once you take out the commitment we\u0027ve made to health, gives flat real spending available for all other departments.Pressed on whether that meant some departments would be hit by cuts, he replied: That\u0027s a choice that we make, isn\u0027t it?You do have a choice of everybody having 0.0 per cent\u0026nbspreal, in other words maintaining their spending power in real terms after inflation year after year after year.Mr Hammond said he expected a deal to be agreed with the EU but warned that a no-deal Brexit could be a shock to the economy.He said: If the economy suffers a shock - and a no-deal Brexit is an example of a shock, but actually we know from history that sometimes the shocks that hit the economy are not the ones we are expecting but ones we aren\u0027t expecting - if there\u0027s a shock to the economy, we will deal with it in the usual way.Very often a shock to the economy actually requires a boost to spending in the short term to support demand and to keep the economy going.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s politics liveblog, where we will be bringing you all the latest updates throughout the day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She’ll be stepping down as leader of her party even earlier, too, in December.Already, a crowded field is building up to replace her as CDU leader, a decision that will take place at the party’s congress in December. Whoever replaces her at the helm of Germany’s conservative party will inevitably also be favourite to become the next chancellor of Europe’s largest economy.Here are some of the main runners and riders to replace her as chancellor in 2021, from her own party and outside it:Known to German political insiders as AKK, Kramp-Karrenbauer is the favourite to replace Merkel as leader of the CDU.\u0026nbspA moderate within the Christian democrats, she broadly shares her boss’s politics and is currently the party’s general secretary, having previously run the state of Saarland.Merkel has specifically said she won’t endorse a candidate in the coming CDU leadership election, but if she had most observers would have expected it to be AKK.\u0026nbspGermany’s health minister has publicly spoken out against Merkel’s welcoming refugee policy, arguing that the CDU had “perhaps put too much emphasis on the humanitarian approach”.An economic liberal who supports tax cuts and a smaller state, the minister has also proved a social liberal on some issues, such as same-sex marriage.\u0026nbspMerz hasn’t been a member of the Bundestag since 2009, but that hasn’t stopped speculation that he might show an interest in coming back to replace Merkel.A former leader of the CDU’s parliamentary group, Merz was Merkel’s rival in the earlier years of her premiership, but was ruthlessly sidelined as her power became unassailable.To come back he would probably have to stand as an MP again in the 2021 elections.The leader of the CDU group in the Bundestag, Brinkhaus inflicted a political wound on Merkel when he got his current job in September – ousting one of her allies.The MP voted against the introduction of same-sex marriage last year, putting him firmly on the social conservative side of the party he is also seen as a small-state liberal.\u0026nbspThe new leader of the centre-left SPD hasn’t managed to reverse her party’s slide yet, but there are still a few years to go before the next election. \u0026nbspMerkel is a fearsome opponent and if the CDU picks the wrong candidate, the SPD may well make a comeback. Or notWeidel was lead candidate for the far-right AfD in the 2017 elections. She’s unlikely to get near the top job because other parties refuse to deal with the AfD in coalition talks and they’re unlikely to win enough support to given alone.It’s also unclear whether she will be in the candidate spot next time, given the AfD’s fractious internal politics.\u0026nbspBut given what’s happened with the extreme right other European countries, she’s worth keeping an eye on.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But I’m happy to tell Sun on Sunday readers that their hard work is paying off.Our jobs market has defied many of the naysayers.Near record numbers of people have a job and unemployment has fallen in every region across the country.There are more than .million additional people in work since .While this is a huge achievement, sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind these numbers are thousands of people up and down our country who are now better able to provide for their families.They can get up every morning knowing they have the security that only a job can bring.And what’s more, they are being rewarded with a pay rise — this month’s figures show the strongest wage growth in almost a decade.Contrary to myths peddled by the opposition, it’s people at the bottom of the pay scale who have benefited most.The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest rise in pay thanks to our National Living Wage and the proportion of low-paid jobs is at a record low.Tomorrow I will deliver my Budget, where I will show how our careful focus on fixing the economy is bearing fruit.Thanks to the balanced approach we have taken — getting our debt falling, while keeping taxes low — and the hard work of the people of the UK, I will be able to set out how we will be investing in our future.Much of the talk surrounding Budgets is often technical. Many, many experts and commentators will have their own take on how the economy is doing.While this is, of course, important, what most ordinary people really care about is how the Budget will improve their day-to-day lives.And one of the issues which I know Sun on Sunday readers care a lot about is transport. With a thousand more people moving into work every day, it’s important that we help to get them there on time.Many of you preparing to start the working week tomorrow will know the frustration of having your journey to work ruined by delays caused by poorly maintained roads. Or of having your car or van damaged by potholes.This isn’t just a bad way to start the day, it’s bad for businesses large and small, and it can be really damaging to the wider economy as well.It’s estimated that congestion costs UK households more than £billion every year. That’s why tomorrow I will announce a bumper £billion investment in our country’s transport network — including a new £.billion fund ring-fencing vehicle excise duty raised in England for spending on our roads.As a former Transport Secretary, I know that these are the arteries that keep our country alive – and they need taking care of. Thirty-two years ago tomorrow, Margaret Thatcher officially opened the final stretch of the M.While few would claim to love this motorway, it’s easy to forget what a landmark moment this was for our country’s transport infrastructure. Three decades later, I am committed to honouring that legacy.And as important as our major roads are, smaller local roads are just as vital to our everyday lives.That’s why I will also announce tomorrow £million of immediate cash for councils to maintain and improve local roads — fixing potholes, repairing damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open.A further £million on top of that will help improve local junctions, allowing better access to workplaces, high streets and other community facilities.This is also part of our commitment to bridging the gap between our regions. Those in rural parts of the country should have the same chances to get on in le and not have poor transport connections limiting their potential.The funding will help make journeys quicker and easier, while boosting productivity and improving access.And because I know that not everyone drives, I will also invest in local transport projects which could include new bus, tram and cycling routes.And I will also look to the future by investing in next-generation methods of transport, which could potentially include self-driving shuttle services.Not only could this revolutionise our transport network, it will also help us become a global leader developing future technologies.And finally, as I earlier announced with the Prime Minister, I am happy to confirm we will also be freezing fuel duty, for the ninth year in a row.This will keep the cost of fuel down for millions of drivers across the UK — saving people around £million this year alone.These measures are only possible due to our careful management of the economy over the past few years — and the hard work of the British people.This country has a bright future ahead, and — thanks to this vital investment package — the journey there just got a bit smoother.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows the strength and resilience of the UK economy alongside the efforts and hard work of families and households up and down the country.In conventional times voters might rightly expect the result of this to be lower taxes , more investment in our public services or to see progress in us paying off the ever ballooning national debt.Instead the Government is preparing to blow this cash - your money - by giving into even more of the EU’s demands.Until last week, Britain expected a  month “transition” or “implementation” period after we formally leave the EU next year on March , .Then, late last week the Government shocked everyone by proposing that we stay in the EU longer than we were originally told and that we extend the so called ‘negotiating period’ to leave the EU.Worse still, on Monday in the House of Commons, we were told that this transition period might last until June  – that’s six years after the referendum result. Whatever happened to Brexit means Brexit On top of our extended membership of the EU, we can expect a bill from the EU! That’s right more of your money with an extra price tag of approximately £ billion each year in contributions to the EU.The Treasury has budgeted for this until the end of  but for each year after , the cost will be as high as £ billion because we will have lost the £. billion a year rebate which was famously secured and successfully negotiated in  by Margaret Thatcher when she demanded our money back from the EU.The British people are once again being treated like fools. What we are now witnessing is a blatant attempt to keep Britain in the EU while Brussels continues to raid the pockets of British taxpayers.This must end and the Government should invoke the great Thatcherite spirit of Fontainebleau and say No, No, No to Brussels. Because pumping our money into an undemocratic and unaccountable system two years after Britain voted to leave the EU is simply not right or acceptable. It makes a mockery of our democracy and is an insult to the British public.It is our money and that money should be handed back to the people and communities across the UK to invest in our domestic priorities.It could help people across Britain– especially the least well off – by giving them back more of the money that they earn by cutting their taxes.For example,we cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, that would cost us £ billion.By increasing the personal allowance by a £,, many more of the poorest paid households would be taken out of tax altogether, that’d cost us £. billion. Andwe cut beer and cider duty by  pence, that would cost us £. billion.So by easing the tax burden for the lowest paid and doing our bit to save British pubs from closing, we’d have invested £ billion into longer term economic growth in our economy.And with the other £ billion  How about supporting the millions of families who want to own their own home by cutting stamp duty for homeowners, we can again help the least well off and give them a hand up and support them in their aspirations to own their home.We could also take more first time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether  If we raised the starting threshold of £, to £,, this would cost the Treasury £. billion.Then there’s the VAT we pay on domestic gas and electricity. The  per cent VAT charge on domestic fuel and power raised around £. billion in  . If we got rid of this we would make fuel cheaper and families would have a little extra left over in their monthly pay packets.What about the VAT charged on sanitary products for women  This should end now and not when we leave the EU s the Government previously promised, especially as leaving the EU will take longer than we were previously promised. VAT receipts from the sale of sanitary products costs approximately £. billion a year but importantly this one VAT cut that would unite women across the country.I could go on. There are so many important domestic key services and priorities to invest in.To govern is to choose and the choice being made our Government is to spend your money on an expensive and everlasting EU membership.And all this comes on top of the ridiculous capitulation where we have agreed to the EU’s demands to hand over a £ billion pay cheque for absolutely nothing in .Britain needs once again to have a long term economic plan that puts our national interest first.Let’s start standing up for Britain by investing in people, businesses and communities rather than the unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats of the European Union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A seven-hour slog live from Westminster City Hall, presented by Adam Hills, Maya Jama and the network’s spare part Alan Carr, who set the tone for most of what followed interviewing Foxy from SAS: Who Dares Wins.“It’s been announced you’ve got a new Stand Up To Cancer series starting next year. Tell us about it.”“I can’t.”“Give us some names.”“I can’t.”No sooner had we written that one off than it become apparent there was no Bake Off special either — just a promo for a show that will be screened months from now. No matter, though. With its lofty public-serving hat on, Adam Hills faithfully promised Channel  would “educate, entertain and inspire” us for the remainder of the evening, which must have looked quite good written down.In practice The first thing to say about Stand Up To Cancer is that it featured some of the most beautul and affecting films you’ll see on a telethon.They needed to be, as well, ’cos you don’t have to have watched the event to know it contained a lot of feeble stunts and sketches.I also could have lived without Adam Hills carrying out a threat to have his pubic hair waxed, live, once the total reached £million, and the educational segment, with Katherine Ryan and Chris O’Dowd, which was sunk the moment he announced: “We’re goingto put the humour in tumour.”Tellingly, there was also a fair bit of non-network talent involved, including James Corden.I’ll not dwell, though, on what Channel ’s Twitter feed did to the Carpool Karaoke segment, where Michael Buble talked about his son’s illness, except to say it was one of those productions where the left hand wasn’t talking to the right.So when Chris O’Dowd was moved to tears talking about the cancer films, the studio audience was guffawing loudly at Alan Carr manoeuvring himself into background position in a Prue Leith wig.By a process of elimination and production gaffs, though, it became apparent the centre of Channel ’s entire universe now is Gogglebox, which had created an all-star version with Louis Tomlinson, Danny Dyer and daughter Dani for the occasion.They missed a trick, frankly, by not capturing Louis falling asleep to The X Factor. But it was still riotously funny watching the regulars pick apart Naked Attraction, with the choicest comment being: “That one looks like Homer Simpson’s mouth.”This was not the sound of people laughing with the channel, though. They were laughing at it.A network that was once known for being brave and innovative is now far more readily associated with a genital parade, third-rate reality shows and cakes than anything in the way of ground-breaking drama or comedy.In fact, the only two genuinely funny people on its payroll are probably Jimmy Carr and Sean Lock, who had to make way, at Stand Up To Cancer, for box-ticking randoms like Mo Gilligan, who was served this testicular curve-ball by Maya Jama.“Do you have a special name for your balls, by any chance ”He does.The Big Narstie Show.So there I was, gently drting off as Darcey Bussell went through the technical motions on Strictly. “The control in the rise and fall. Strong in the two-three.”When, unless I’m imagining it, she told Sean Walsh: “You have to smooth it out and iron it out, so it isn’t jerking off or skippy.”Suddenly I was all ears for the show’s Halloween special – an event which, for three good reasons, is usually my least favourite of the run.Firstly, Tess always expects a laugh for referring to it as a “spook-tacular”. Secondly, someone does The ****ing Timewarp. And thirdly, the worst danceris forced to jig around to The Monster Mash.We got it all, on Saturday night, of course, yet somehow it didn’t feel quite such an endurance as normal.This may have been partly down to Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer, who both danced like dreams, but it definitely owed something to the presence of Sean, who’s added real jeopardy to proceedings andactual comedy.His snog with Katya has made sense of a dreadful line-up and the BBC should be eternally grateful to The Sun and the photographer for capturing the moment.So although the handbag-clutchers will no doubt disagree, I was genuinely sad to see him voted off and probably back to the ex-girlfriend, where, in the words of Darcey Bussell, he’ll have to “smooth it out and iron it out” or he’ll end up, you know . . . “skippy”.Sandra Oh’s performance in Killing Eve.

Suzy, , was abducted in  and declared dead, presumed murdered, in .It follows information that Cannan may have buried -year-old Suzy there after abducting and murdering her.Excavation work was focusing on an old corrugated iron garage in the back garden of the semi- detached property in Sutton Coldfield, West Mids.A forensic tent was also placed over an area of concrete patio.Suzy disappeared after going to meet a client named “Mr Kipper” to show him two houses in Fulham, South West London in July .Her body has never been found, though she was declared dead — presumed murdered — in .It remains one of Britain’s most infamous unsolved murders.But cold case review detectives now suspect that after murdering Suzy, Cannan may have driven to what was then his mother’s home.They fear he put Suzy’s body in an inspection pit in the garage he used for working on cars, before filling it with concrete.The corrugated iron structure was yesterday dismantled by Met Police specialist search cops to enable excavation work to start.Ground-penetrating radar was used to scan the area and a tent was erected where the garage stood.The team of about a dozen officers had shovels and garden forks on hand for digging.A side entrance to the garden via a small private track, was cordoned off at around am as the search team arrived in eight police vans.Officers conducted the grim search just a few feet from a children’s trampoline and a swing.The importance of the search is enhanced by Cannan’s habit of ing to his mother’s home after committing serious crimes.It is believed that his mother Sheila is in her s and living in a dferent part of the country.There is no suggestion that she was involved in or had any knowledge of this or any of his crimes.The search at her former home is expected to go on for several days. A forensic archaeologist is guiding cops during the search.It is being carried out with the full consent of a family who have lived there since Cannan’s mother moved out in .The cold case review team is not conducting a full-scale investigation into Suzy’s abduction and murder but are said to be acting on specic information relating to the potential burial site.A source said: “The couple who lived there were shocked when the police came to them asking to search their garden.“But they have given their full consent to the search.“Police have already conducted a cursory examination there and established that everything fits with what they were told.”Cannan, now , is serving a minimum  years in Full Sutton prison for the murder of Shirley Banks in .Information was first received in December  from one of Cannan’s fellow prisoners, that Suzy was buried under the patio at his mother’s house.The inmate came forward after police took the highly unusual step of naming Cannan as their prime suspect when the CPS ruled there was insufficient information to charge him with Suzy’s murder.Cannan is serving three le sentences for murdering newlywed Shirley in Bristol in October , attempting to kidnap a woman the previous evening and raping another woman at knepoint in Reading, Berks, a year earlier.The suspected serial killer was captured three weeks after Shirley, , vanished, when he robbed a dress shop assistant at knepoint in Leamington Spa, Warwicks.A road tax disc from Shirley’s car was found in the glove box of Cannan’s black BMW. It led to the discovery of her Mini Clubman in his garage at a block of flats where he lived in Clton, Bristol.The Mini had the  number plate SLP S — suspected of being a reference to Suzy’s name.Cannan was given a whole le sentence at Exeter crown court in April , but it was commuted on appeal to a -year minimum tarf, meaning he is eligible to apply for parole in four years.Ex-car salesman Cannan is also a leading suspect in the murder of Bournemouth insurance worker Sandra Court, , whose body was found in a water-filled ditch after she was abducted in May .Despite a wealth of circumstantial evidence in Suzy’s murder pointing towards Cannan, the case against him has been undermined by a lack of forensic evidence and a body.Three major searches for Suzy were conducted in the early s and in .The first two focused on a former barracks site in Worcestershire.Then in  a field near the barracks was searched, along with a Quantock Hills earthwork site in Somerset known as Dead Woman’s Ditch, where Shirley’s body was found in .The Met Police said last night: “The search follows information received in relation to a historical unsolved investigation.“We will not be commenting on speculation surrounding the search, or providing any further information at this time.”THE search at the former home of John Cannan’s mother comes too late for Suzy’s parents.Her solicitor father Paul died in June this year aged  after a long battle with Parkinson’s disease. Her mother Diana, , died in .Following their daughter’s disappearance, the Lamplughs, of East Sheen, South West London, set up the Suzy Lamplugh Trust to promote safety of women in memory of their daughter.They campaigned for better taxi safety and laws protecting victims of stalking.The couple, who have three other children, Richard, Tamsin and Lizzie who were both awarded the OBE in .They were convinced of Cannan’s guilt.Mr Lamplugh spoke out after the  decision by the CPS not to prosecute.He said: “Suzy was a lovely girl and we and her brother and sisters and her many friends still miss her enormously.“It’s greatly distressing that Suzy’s body has not been found nor do we know how she was killed.“The least the offender can do now is tell us where the body is.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There were announcements on schools funding, defence, moving “from disposable to reusable cups across all beverage types” — even a tax break for public loos. More money for social care and Universal Credit.Shopkeepers will breathe a sigh of relief at a hefty cut to business rates.There were hints of more money for the police. Sun readers will also welcome the tax freezes on beer, spirits, cider and short-haul flights.But the big bucks — some £.billion of the £.billion extra the Government expects to spend come - — went to the NHS, fulfilling the Prime Minister’s summer promise to increase spending as a th birthday present to a health service creaking under the strain of an ageing population.The question, of course, was how the Chancellor was going to pay for it.Before the Budget, all sorts of grim possibilities had been floated.Extra taxes on white-van men, lower- ing the VAT threshold and tightening the rules about National Insurance contributions. Taxes on plastic cups . Taxes on pretty much anything, really.Perhaps the best thing the Chancellor did in his Budget, then, was say “No”.To almost all of it. For an hour or more, I waited for the sting in the tail — the bit where Fiscal Phil turned Hatchet Hammond.But it never came. In paying for his promises — and above all, the NHS — the Chancellor was helped by better-than-expected borrowing forecasts, which showed our economy’s remarkable record of creating jobs is still going strong.But he has also made a calculation that it is better to live with a small and manageable deficit than try to drag the finances back into surplus at the cost of higher taxes. And that voters will see through Labour’s promises to hike borrowing back to stratospheric levels in the name of a socialist transformation of the economy.He decided, in other words, people pay enough tax already.And he’s right. All too often in recent years, it has felt like the answer to every problem — at least from Whitehall’s point of view — is higher taxes and more interference.Hammond was never going to copy his tax-slashing Tory predecessor Nigel Lawson, who made it a point of principle to abolish a dferent tax with every Budget.But at least he drew a line in the sand, deciding it is better when hardworking people get to keep more of their own money.That ending austerity should not, and must not, mean higher tax bills. That hard work should mean hard cash in your pocket.Yes, Hammond — like every Chancellor since Gordon Brown — made too many fiddly little announcements.But he avoided the kind of whacking- great raid on taxpayers’ pockets so many were urging him towards.This doesn’t mean we are out of the woods. Britain’s growth prospects over the next half-decade are still extraordinarily sluggish.The outcome of the Brexit deal will drastically change the fiscal picture.In many ways, Hammond’s speech yesterday was a holding action ahead of the much bigger decisions to come.We still need much more radical action to kickstart growth and productivity. Despite the scale of the housing crisis, for example, there was only tinkering around the edges.But a large part of delivering that growth must involve making the economy more dynamic, more competitive and letting people keep more of their own money as a reward for their efforts — moving the country in the direction outlined by Philip Hammond, rather than the one sketched out by Jeremy Corbyn .The overall verdict on the Budget  The jokes were worse than expected but the numbers were better.More spending on the NHS, tax cuts for millions of voters and the worst ideas kept out of it.Yes, borrowing will be higher — but low enough to keep us out of the danger zone and far, far lower than under a Corbyn government.That is a menu Philip Hammond will be pretty happy with.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

he invaded Ethiopia which was widely condemned by the Western Powers but he got the backing of Germany’s leader Adolf Hitler.Hitler and Mussolini formed what was called the Rome-Berlin Axis and signed a treaty of co-operation.On June ,  Italy joined the Second World War, on the side of Germany.In October that year Mussolini sent Italian forces into Greece although it was unsuccessful and the counter-offensive pushed the forces back to Albania.Italy also suffered a humiliating defeat when it joined with Germany in launching an attack on the Soviet Union.Mussolini also suffered a defeat when the Axis Powers were crushed in North Africa..In July  the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini and on July  the king dismissed him as head of the government.He was held in custody until he was rescued by German troops.Mussolini then tried to flee the country with his mistress Clara Petacci to Switzerland but both were captured by communist partisans and executed by firing squad.His body was then taken to Milan was it was hung upside down at a petrol station to publicly confirm his death.The far-right Forza Nuova party had announced a march called the “March of Patriots” in Rome for October  but the Interior Minister Marco Minniti said any march would be illegal.Speaking in parliament in September he said that any event like that “clearly recall[ed] the birth of the fascist regime and would clearly contrast with the legal order.In response to the initial criticism, Forza Nuovas leader Roberto Fiore denied any fascist or nostalgic element to the march, and called it a walk for security."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000445414941.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"philip hammond facebook amazon google","story":"The Chancellor said it wasn’t fair that companies such as Facebook were making so much in the UK but paying so little to the Treasury.The new ‘Digital Services Tax’ will see the so-called ‘Faangs’ – Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google – taxed two per cent on the revenue they make from advertising and online marketplaces from April .Critics said it defied belief that the UK had set its rate at two per cent rather than the three per cent mooted by the European Union.Spain earlier this month proposed a three per cent rate when unveiling its own proposals to get tough with web companies and streaming services.The actual taxable revenue will also be based on ‘self-assessment’ by the companies.But the Chancellor insisted Britain was leading the way by moving now.Sources claimed an EU-wide tax was unlikely because Germany is fiercely opposed to the move.Speaking in the Commons Mr Hammond said: “Digital s pose a real challenge for the“The rules have simply not kept pace with changing business models.“And it’s clearly not sustainable, or fair, that digital  businesses can generate substantial value in the UK without paying tax here in respect of that business.”He added: “A new global agreement is the best long-term solution, but progress is painful slow.

He stormed: “The new tax isn’t even set to be implemented until  at which time the tech giants will start to enjoy a  per cent cut in their corporation tax rate. The lack of ambition in this announcement is just derisory.”Spain’s Finance Ministry unveiled its plans for a Digital Services Tax earlier this month – saying it wanted to also include giants such as Uber and Airbnb.Facebook Spain reported losses of £, recently.Finance Minister Maria Jesus Montero stormed: “There are businesses we all know that are dedicated to services and are generating billions in economic activity, yet do not pay appropriate taxes.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

when double the alcohol limit told cops she didnt know her colleagues had been topping up her drink on works night out","story":"Rachel Hind, , was stopped by cops when they saw her Audi A swerving onto the wrong side of the road after she left an Italian restaurant.Hind had just treated  colleagues to dinner, but on her way home at am police officers had to take evasive action in their patrol van to avoid hitting Hinds car.When whey asked her to get out of her car, the registered nurse struggled to get her keys out of the ignition.She was also staggering in her high heels with slurred speech, glazed eyes and her breath smelling heavily of alcohol, the court heard.It emerged the mum-of-two had been drinking Prosecco, gin and tonic and double vodkas with cola during one of her regular evenings out to thank their employees before heading to her £.million home in High Legh, near Knutsford, Cheshire.At Manchester Magistrates Court Hind admitted drink driving but tried to argue against disqualication claiming she thought she was sober at the time.She added that she did not realise a colleague had unwittingly topped up her drinks throughout the evening in the belief she was getting a taxi home.She claimed she was only swerving around in the road as she was attempting to avoid potholes. JPs banned her for  months and fined her £, with costs of £.The incident occurred at .am on June  this year after Hind had left the Italian Job restaurant in Urmston after the party had spent up to six hours eating and drinking.John Richards prosecuting said: The police evidence says she was swerving around.She was unsteady on her feet, her eyes were glazed and her speech was slurred. She was staggering and her breath stank of alcohol and she needed help into the police van.The crown say it would have been patently obvious to her that she was over the limit. You might think it’s strange that she didn’t realise her Prosecco had been topped up. In a short period of time, the glass goes from half full to full - how did she not realise that In terms of the vodka and cola, evenit was the case that you’re dealing with single shots, you’re going to knowit’s got alcohol in it. But we are talking about doubles here. The crown says that it doesn’t stack up that she didn’t realise.Tests showed Hind, who specialises in end-of-le care at her two care homes, blew a reading of  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit is mg.She told the hearing: Every quarter of the year I take the staff out for a meal and drinks and to say thank you. I take them to an Italian restaurant and they have an open bar. I just pay the bill and let them have what they want.I would always drive there and drive home. Very occasionally, I would get a taxi but on that day I drove. I was on call that night which means I am in charge of running the night sht. I ordered a single gin and tonic.I always would have a gin and tonic and maybe a glass of ProseccoI was having a three-course meal.She added: There were jugs of water all along the table which I had some of. I also had about four to five glasses of coke and I also had a glass of Prosecco with my main meal which was at about ish. I felt fine. I didn’t feel drunk, I felt fine to drive - I didn’t think I was taking a risk. I gave my colleague a lt home, which I wouldn’t have doneI felt drunk.But the road was full of potholes. It did occur to me that I hope the police don’t think I am a drunk driver because I am swerving to avoid the potholes. I have had four punctures in two years on that car from potholes.But I didn’t think I caused the police van to swerve. The police woman told me to open my car and I told her that I needed to shut the car door to turn off the engine - I did struggle to get the car keys out when I did this.I told the officer from the very beginning that I had been drinking, but it was only one gin and tonic and a glass of Prosecco over the course of a three course meal. I struggled out of the police van, but I was wearing high heels and I don’t normally wear them.I had a terrible row with my husband about it afterwards. I was disappointed in myself and I went into a spell of depression. I couldn’t tell anybody at work about it because I am their employer and I am supposed to be an example to them.She claimed a colleague Amanda Jackson later confessed to topping up her drinks during the evening during a heart-to-heart meeting and added: She went white in the face and said ‘I’m sorry, but I topped your drinks up that night.’She didn’t know I was driving home and she told me that she had been giving me drinks. She said she topped up my Prosecco once and that she had put Vodka and Cokes on the table.If I am drinking alcohol, it’s only gin and tonic that I am drinking which I know the smell and taste of. I don’t drink vodka. I have never been a vodka and cola - it just tasted of cola.Retrospectively, I can see now that I was drunk but at no point did I feel over the limit at the time, I was talking to my colleague all the way home in the car.My cousin died after being hit by an articulated lorry and my best friends nephew was also hit by a drunk driver. I haven’t drink driven until this incident where I unknowingly got into my car while over the limit and drove.Work colleague Miss Jackson admitted unwittingly getting doubles for her boss.She said: I made sure that the drinks and food were going to the right people. I went to the bar a couple of times and ordered about four vodka and cokes each time and I just brought them to the table and put them down there.I saw she was drinking coke but I didn’t realise she was supposed to be drinking normal coke.I was just going around the table filling the glasses up. I filled them all up.When she told me what happened I said ‘Oh my god, I am so sorry I bought you some drinks and I didn’t know you weren’t drinking.’It’s all my fault and she’s in all this trouble and I didn’t know she wasn’t drinking. She is my boss and she is amazing at what she does, and I feel terrible and will take the consequences.I am not going to lie, I was quite drunk that night - about a  .”Hinds lawyer Miss Stephanie Varle said: “In the UK, a lot of people drink a small amount of alcohol and drive.You have heard that she reasonably believed that she drank a gin and tonic and a glass of Prosecco and was safe to drive home. She did go out and consume some alcohol, which the law permits her to do - but she didn’t notice her drink had been topped up.This is a woman who works  hours and was on call on that evening. I submit that when she was moving around, she would not notice an odourless drink. She was driving at a normal speed and was simply trying to circumnavigate the potholes in the road.The alcohol limit does unfortunately permit people to lawfully get behind the wheel of a car after some drink.But JP Edward Tasker, said: Having heard all the evidence, we don’t accept that the defendant didn’t know that the drinks didn’t have alcohol in them."},{"url":null,"title":"giant rat invasion foot long bristol","story":"The woman, who asked not to be named, spotted the giant rodents scurrying along her turfed balcony in the Lockleaze area of Bristol.The mum said the first-floor balcony of her housing association home had become infested along with neighbours properties.She told the Bristol Post: Something needs to be done to cure this problem for good.They have chewed threw the walls of the building to get across to each property.My children have noticed them but theyre a bit young to understand.Bristol-based United Communities housing association said the entire city has been suffering from rat infestations.Jayme Whittleson, control manager at the housing association, said: This was first reported to us on Facebook and straight away we attended.The bins were in a very reasonable order, they werent over-flowing.Rats are an issue all over the city.This summers heatwave brought a plague of giant rats across the UK.The disease-ridden rodents can grow up to four feet long - twice the size of a typical house cat.Experts say there could now be as many as  million rats across Britain.We pay for your stories!

That was a big sht. In hindsight, however, it was hardly surprising.Philip Hammond needed as much money as he could get his hands on to both increase departmental spendingand to fund the giveaways previously announced by the prime minister, most notably the extra NHS spending.And thats before one gets to the rabbit out of his hat: increasing the tax-free personal allowance a year early.Is austerity really coming to an end  It depends how you measure it.If you ignore the NHS, per-capita spending cuts are due to continue in the coming years - albeit gradually.Include the NHS, and it certainly looks like austerity is over.Either way, the pace of cuts has reduced considerably - all at the cost, though, of higher borrowing and public finances that remain very weak.Indeed, the chancellors pledge to eliminate the budget deficit by the middle of the next decade has been well and truly broken, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.The politics was as interesting as the economics.An end to austerity , abolishing PFI, introducing a tax on tech giants, putting billions into the benefits system and, most of all, the decision to spend rather than save the extra windfall in the public finances.One can hardly imagine previous Conservative chancellors doing that - but that is precisely what this government has done.Its hard to believe it was a Conservative budget. POLITICSBeth Rigby, deputy political editor Phillip Hammond said his was a budget for the \"grafters and strivers\" who get up early and go to work - as he tried to use his statement to assure them that \"their hard work is paying off and the era of austerity is coming to an end\".And he put his money where his mouth was, as he brought promised tax cuts for  million people forward by a year.The personal tax allowance is being lted to #, in April , while the level at which the higher rate of tax kicks in will also be raised to #, a year.Those cuts brought him cheers in the chamber, but when it came to wider public spending, it was a jam tomorrow budget for a chancellor boxed in by the economic uncertainty of Brexit. Fiscally, it is dficult to calculate how much the public finances will be affected by Brexit when we still dont knowthe UK will be leaving with a deal or not.There was a bit of extra money for social care , for defence , for schoolsand for potholes and road repairs .In reality, however, the big spending decisions will come next year in a post-Brexit spending review for the whole of Whitehall.But Mr Hammond did find money for Universal Credit to reverse swingeing cuts for Britains lowest earners, promising an extra #bn over the next five years to help ameliorate the worst effects of shting from the old benefits system to the new one.That was well below what some Conservative MPs had been demanding, though.Against the backdrop of Brexit, Mr Hammond was pretty constrained.Ending austerity is a post-Brexit project - and the current incumbents of No  and No  Downing Street may well not be the pair wholl end up delivering it. BUSINESSIan King, business presenterThere were some welcome announcements for business.Entrepreneurs relief, which some had expected to get the chop, lives for another day but the minimum qualying period will be extended from one year to two years to ensure it does genuinely work as intended.Small businesses dodged a bullet when the threshold at which VAT becomes payable was kept at #, for the next two years. Many had expected it to be lowered.There were also tweaks to the use by large private companies of private contractors to avoid paying national insurance. These measures have already been rolled out for the public sector.Then came the much-touted assault on the US tech giants.Digital s \"pose a real challenge to the sustainability and fairness of our tax system\", said Mr Hammond, highlighting the low taxes paid by the tech multinationals."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/10/2048x1152/skynews-hammond-philip-chancellor_4465757.jpg?20181026170840 ","title":"the last budget before brexit but a deal hasnt happened yet","story":"The deficit should have been closing in on zero. Instead, it is left at a persistent #bn or so.So the government retrospectively funded the promise made by the PM for the biggest ever cash increase in NHS funding, but did so without raising taxes.In fact it cut them a bit by accelerating to this coming April, the rise in basic rate and higher rate income tax thresholds to #, and #, respectively.At the time of that announcement in summer, even at the Conservative Party conference, the Chancellor had suggested that these spending rises would be at least partly funded by tax rises.Not so, according to these numbers. But they may yet materialise on the other side of the Brexit fog.In that respect - the extra spending on the NHS, not funded by a tax rise - there was an end to austerity politics.

But as always, the devils in the detail. Once you get past the bad jokes, the shiny baubles and the claims that austerity is over - all thats left is the small print. And guess what  Some of it will leave you and your family worse off. Weve trawled through all  pages of the Budget Red Book, plus the independent Office of Budget Responsibility s assessment of the measures in it. Heres a few things you might not have spotted.  A chart buried in the small print shows how the Budget won’t actually make the poorest % any better off. This diagram shows the cumulative impact of ALL tax, welfare and public service changes since  - a mammoth task. Look at it - the poorest people are on the left, and they simply flatline in the analysis. While the richest % are taking a hit, it’s middle-class people - those in the top % or % - who will benefit the most, gaining up to pound a year.  Philip Hammond made a big play of pumping more money into defence and the NHS. But he was a little quieter about yet more swingeing cuts being forced on some of the biggest frontline Whitehall departments. The Department for Work and Pensions is being expected to cut its budget from poundbn to pound.bn in   . The Ministry of Justice is being cut from pound.bn to poundbn. And the housing and communities section of Whitehall is being cut from pound.bn to pound.bn. That’s despite a welfare crisis, a prisons crisis and a housing crisis. Why are they doing this  . That plastic tax will take FOUR YEARS to come in  Chancellor Philip Hammond claimed he’d become a world leader in tackling the scourge of plastic littering our planet.” He might have to do a bit better then. Not only did he resist any call to tax plastic cups. His big signature move - a tax on packaging that doesn’t have at least % recycled plastic - will only come in April . He made no mention of the date in his speech - we had to find it in the small print. Environmental Audit Committee chair Mary Creagh blasted: This speaks volumes about the Treasury’s priorities. As China, Vietnam and Thailand close their doors on Britain’s plastic waste the chancellors response is keep calm and carry on.”  According to the OBR forecast Google and other online giants could pay a mere poundm each under Hammonds new tax. Labour said the figure was “a pittance for these massive international companies” They said the percentage of tax paid by the big five tech giants had halved since . The new tax won’t come into force until  at which time the tech giants will start to enjoy a % cut in their corporation tax rate. Tom Watson, shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: “The lack of ambition in this announcement is derisory.” . … And it raises even less than we thought  If you thought the poundm raised from the Digital Services Tax didn’t seem like much, then don’t look at the back of the Budget book. It shows poundm a year is only what it’ll raise in . Next year it raises…. poundmillion. And in   it only raises poundmillion. . Crack cocaine of gambling stakes will stay above pound for another year  Campaigners blasted a six-month delay to cutting stakes on fixed-odds betting terminalsto pound. The move to slash maximum stakes on the “crack cocaine of gambling” from pound had been expected to come into force next April. But the Budget small print revealed the move will not take place until October. The Campaign for Fairer Gambling said it was “unacceptable”. Labour’s Carolyn Harris, who chairs Parliament’s cross-party group on FOBTs, was “appalled” at the “wholly unjustiable” delay. But a Treasury source said: “It’s clearly a judgement call. This we think strikes the right balance.”  Hammond announced an extra pound million for struggling schools to pay for “the little extras” they can’t afford. Many parents will have breathed a sigh of relief at the news, after getting begging letters from their kids’ teachers, asking for money to pay for such extravagances as pens, books and toilet paper. But they’ll be disappointed. The money is “capital spending”, ringfenced for building maintenance and purchasing equipment. That means schools will be allowed to buy iPads with the extra cash, but not pens and paper.  The Sovereign Grant - the money paid by the government to support the Queen in her royal duties is going up. Again. Last year the figure was .m - this year it’ll go up to an eye-watering pound. million. The size of the grant is usually % of the government’s income from Crown Estates. But last year she got a  year boost to % to pay for essential refurbishment of Buckingham Palace.  The government is set to introduce a tax on vaping for the first time. So-called heated tobacco products will be taxed at the same rate as hand rolling tobacco from April . Duty on rolling tobacco amounts to around pound for the smallest, g packs. Its unclear how this would translate to vape fluid, which is measured in millilitres, or whether there would be a minimum level of duty.  Tory ministers have finally admitted they’re delaying Universal Credit, the small print reveals. The rollout of the hated six-in-one benefit will officially end in December  - the ninth delay after its last end date of March . And it may only finish in June , because the Office for Budget Responsibility “assumes” it will take six months longer than the Department for Work and Pensionssays. Just weeks ago, the DWP was refusing to confirm any delay to the Mirror. Delaying the rollout will actually save the DWP poundbillion - because thanks to a pound.bn-a-year package of help, it’s now “more expensive than the legacy system would have been”, the OBR declared. There’s also a suggestion that the money will be saved because, by delaying UC, less will be handed over to claimants in transition payments.  The Office For Budget Responsibility admits No Deal Brexit will have a “severe” impact. “If an agreement is not reached in time, it could have a severe short-term impact on demand and supply in the economy,” it says. “It is next to impossible to calibrate this sort of scenario because of the lack of precedent.” Philip Hammond announced another poundmillion in no-deal Brexit preparations, taking the total to pound.billion. The Chancellor boasted of “firepower to intervene”the economy needs more support in coming months - with poundbillion of “headroom” to deploy. Labour’s Chris Leslie, of the People’s Vote campaign, claimed: “There is no Brexit idend, only years of extended pain.” . … And the Brexit orce bill may have hit poundbillion  Again, this is one from the independent OBR, not the Budget document itself. The experts forecast that the Brexit orce bill could hit poundbn, much higher than the poundbn the government has claimed. It’s been revised up because of a weaker pound-euro exchange rate, and changes to contribution formulas and timetables. Best for Britain chief Eloise Todd said: Far from the fantasy millions promised by Brexiters, it has become increasingly clear that Britain will be facing a Brexit deficit.” . A controversial Tory home buying scheme is being reopened, and it’s costing poundbillion  You’d think a package of help for first-time buyers costing almost poundbillion might have been mentioned in the Budget speech. But nope - you have to delve into the documents to find the Help to Buy equity loan scheme is being reopened for two years from April . The scheme was previously slammed for helping buyers who were already well-off and allowing a five-year “time bomb” of fees to build up. This time it will be available only to first-time buyers - correcting a major flaw in the old scheme - but there are still some elements of unfairness. Londoners will be able to use it to get a home worth pound,, while in the North East it’s only available on homes worth pound,. And the scheme’s enormous cost on its own will attract attention.  We’ve found this one not in the Budget itself, but the report from the Office for Budget Responsibility. It says capital spending - long-term one-off hits on building projects and the like - has been cut, and the Treasury hasn’t spelt it out. The OBR says: “Departmental capital spending has also been cut from - onwards, a decision that does not appear on the Treasury’s scorecard of policy measures.” "},{"url":null,"title":"budget 2018 giveaways benefit rich","story":"NewsBudget  giveaways will benefit rich families  TIMES more than the poorHouseholds in the wealthiest % will gain £ from income tax and benefits changes announced yesterday, the Resolution Foundation saidShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video budget--the-key-points-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis years Budget giveaways will benefit rich families  TIMES more than the poor, a damning snap analysis has found. Households in the wealthiest % will gain pound from income tax and benefits changes announced yesterday, the Resolution Foundation said. But those in the poorest % will gain just pound, the think tank warned. It blows a hole in Tory Philip Hammonds claim that the age of austerity was coming to an end. The Chancellor put much of the focus yesterday on a promise to raise the tax-free personal allowance in Income Tax - which hands pound a year to any worker earning over pound, from April.  But he also followed through on a pledge to hike the p tax rate threshold from pound, to pound,. That means the richest % of Brits will be able to earn much more before they start paying higher tax - gaining pound a year. Today the Chancellor admitted higher earners will get a bit more. Asked why higher earners needed a tax cut, he told ITV: We made a manesto commitment at the last general election. The Resolution Foundation, a left-leaning think tank, said % of the income tax cuts announced at yesterdays Budget will go to the richer half of earners next year.  By , almost half the income tax cutswill go to the top % of households alone, the think tank said. Tax and benefit changes since , overall, will help the richest fth of households by pound while the poorest fth lose pound. Resolution Foundation director Torsten Bell warned the Budget spelt an easing rather than an end to austerity. He added: Income tax cuts announced yesterday will overwhelmingly benefit richer households, with almost half of the long term gains going to the top ten per cent of households. On public services the NHS saw a big spending boost shy– but unprotected departments still have further cuts penciled in.

Instead, Philip Hammond shattered any illusions of better days ahead by failing to stump up anywhere near enough cash to fix the broken system. The Chancellor was accused of delivering a Budget of sticking-plaster solutions that proves austerity is alive and kicking, despite his brass-necked claim it was coming to an end.Mr Hammond boasted of an extra poundmillion for social care, while still slashing pound.billion from councils, who fund much of that care.  He failed to pledge any more money for police to tackle soaring crime. And he infuriated teachers by offering cash-strapped schools a poundmillion payment to “buy the little extras they need” – less than the poundmillion he shypromised to fix potholes. The one-off sum would not even cover a teaching assistant’s wage for every school. Mr Hammond confirmed the NHS would get another poundbillion but experts warned it was not enough to save the service from collapse. And there was no promise to halt the hated Universal Credit benefit. But he did give tax breaks for the better off. Newcastle council leader Nick Forbes led the criticism.He said: “‘Austerity is over’ was a fat lie. The Government is still shyplanning cuts of pound.billion to councils. poundmillion goes nowhere near the poundbillion needed to shystabilise the system. It is still a net cut to local shygovernment.” Alzheimer’s Society chief executive Jeremy Hughes added: “The poundmillion to prop up the broken social care system just staves off total collapse.”  Association of shyDirectors of Adult Social Services president Glen Garrod said: “This is far short of the pound.billion we shyidentied would be needed for social care to stand still in  . This Budget has failed to provide the long-term funding solution social care desperately needs.” Shadow social care minister Barbara Keeley added: “This short-sighted Government, for the fth year running, has offered only a short-term sticking plaster to stave off a shycatastrophic collapse in social care.” Education chiefs and unions also turned on Mr Hammond, branding his one-off payment for schools “insulting”. It would equate to an average of pound, per primary – not enough to cover the average pound, salary of a teaching assistant. It would equate to an average of pound, per primary – not enough to cover the average pound, salary of a teaching assistant. NASUWT union general secretary Chris Keates said: “To suggest that all schools need is a nominal sum to fund the ‘little extras’, when they have faced years of real-terms cuts to budgets is deeply insulting and disingenuous.” Jeremy Corbyn branded Mr Hammond’s -minute speech a “broken promise Budget”.  The Labour leader added: “What we’ve heard are half measures and quick fixes while austerity grinds on.” Resolution Foundation director Torsten Bell added: “Tough times are far from over.” On the switch to Universal Credit, the Chancellor boasted he would give an extra poundbillion to “aid the transition”. But the Mirror discovered he is putting in just poundmillion this year. Even his promise of poundbillion for mental health services turned out to be from the poundbillion pot Theresa May pledged in June. Mr Hammond announced a tiny increase in growth forecasts, from .% to .% for . But experts warned his that could be blown apart in a no-deal Brexit. The income tax personal allowance will rise from pound, to pound, and the higher rate threshold from pound, to pound, in April. Campaigners pointed out this helps those on higher wages more than the average worker. Mr Hammond pledged an extra poundmillion for no-deal Brexit shypreparations and poundbillion for defence.

The little extras headteachers need include not having to close their schools early, not having to cancel music and swimming lessons, not having to lay off teaching assistants and not having to beg parents for items such as toilet paper and stationery. Hammond’s choice of words pointed to a deeper problem. It implied that teachers and parents should be grateful for his largesse. But when you have put someone in hospital, you should not be surprisedthe patient then takes umbrageyou come round with a bunch of grapes and words of comfort. The Resolution Foundation think tank delivered its verdict on the Budget this morning and found it was deeply regressive. The Tories like to spin the raising of the income tax threshold as evidence of how they are helping the just about managing but it is a tax cut which is skewed towards the better off and does nothing for the five million people who earn too little to pay the tax.According to the Resolution Foundation, % of the income tax cuts announced yesterday will go to the top half of earners. The richest tenth of households are set to gain  times as much in cash terms next year from the income tax and benefits giveaways in the Budget as the poorest tenth of households . The small print tells a dferent narrative to that presented by the Chancellor. Once you strip away the increase in NHS spending then there is almost nothing for other departments. Even the extra pound.billion for the universal credit is offset by the poundbillion of welfare cuts being imposed by the Tories. Hammond framed his Budget as an example of how the Conservatives were balancing the ending of austerity with continued fiscal discipline. This was a sleight of hand when the figures show the strictures will remain in place for several years to come. The giveaways masked a bigger issue: the Chancellor has limited room to manoeuvre until Brexit is resolved. Everything is predicated upon Theresa May securing a deal."},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds queue street see incredible","story":"NewsHundreds queue in street to see incredible secret paintings discovered in pensioners home after he diedEric Tuckers massive painting collection was discovered by relatives in Warrington, Cheshire when they went to clear out his home after he died at the age of ShareCommentsByPhoebe Jobling:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video erik-tuckers-brother-says-no-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailUnskilled labourer Eric Tucker left a secret unseen legacy of artworks worthy of LS Lowry when he died at the home he lived in for virtually all his le. Unbeknown to his family, the ex-boxer who left school at  without qualication braved arthritis to create  oil and water colours in his front room over a seven decade period depicting working class le in his hometown. Rather than offering them for sale or exhibition, Eric kept his works out of public view - and instead stacked them around his unassuming end terraced property including his airing cupboard, in his shed and on top of his wardrobes. The massive painting collection was only discovered by relatives after the bachelor who lived alone in Warrington, Cheshire passed away last July aged  and they went to clear out his home.  Most of the pictures feature Lowry-type scenes from smoky pubs, tumbledown terraced streets and factories and showing flat capped locals with their wives. There are also several paintings of clowns, following on from Eric’s love of the circus as a child and portraits of his parents. Now Erics former home is to temporarily turned into a free art gallery for one weekend only which will display  of his paintings in an exhibition entitled  Years of Unseen Art. Younger brother Tony, , said: We did know Eric had a passion for art but never realised he had hoarded a huge collection in his home. He was a very modest man who never talked up his skills and despite doing sketches in his local he appeared to everyone just to be an ordinary Joe.  “Now all of the family have been wonderful, and we’ve all worked together in the hope that we will do justice to Erics work justice and get him the recognition he so richly deserves. We’re just sad that he isnt alive to see this all happen.” Eric the oldest of three children was born at the property in  and left school in  when he was just . He took up boxing and served four years in the Royal Horse Guards in Germany before working for local building contractors Arthur Monk in Warrington. His brother added: Eric didn’t do very well at school. He didn’t like being organised or people telling him what to do but he was intelligent and creative. He was known for having a love of boxing but he also had a passion for art too, “Despite having arthritis for most of his le, he never stopped painting. I’d call round to the house and find him painting on the front parlour. He never had any art training, but he was very committed. He was very modest. Painting wasn’t a hobby, it was his le.” Eric often drank in local pubs and working mens clubs and his paintings were often based on barroom scenes. Tony added: “Whenever he was in the pub, he would sketch on scraps of paper, drawing people in pubs across Warrington and Manchester. He especially loved Manchester in the s.  “Eric was a socialist and felt the most comfortable around ordinary working people and that they had the richest lives. He believed that people should always look out for one another. He had no formal art training beyond a sign writing apprenticeship but his knowledge and appreciation of painting was extensive – and his opinions on the subject were totally valid. He did get some offers to exhibit or buy his work but for some reason he refused as he did not want his paintings given away. Sadly his arthritis eventually prevented him from holding a paint brush but he did say he wanted his paintings to be seen after he was gone. We just assumed it would be a few pieces - but not . They were stacked up all around his house in his shed and on top of wardrobes. Im sure he will be delighted to learn his work will get a great deal of recognition. The exhibition will open from October  to  at Erics home Number , King George Crescent, Warrington, WA SH.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex joined a group of children to see who could throw their boots the furthest to kick off the th day of their Royal Tour. It started to rain just as they arrived in Redvale, North Shore to dedicate a -hectare area of native bush to the Queens Commonwealth Canopy, but that didnt stop them getting involved in the fun. Harry threw first with a blue and yellow spotted welly for his yellow team: two pupils from Pinehill Primary School. Meghan was the last to throw from her red team and they were lagging behind Harrys yellow. Cheered on by the pupils shouting Go Meghan, she tossed the red and white spotted boot high into the air-even surprising herself at how far it went.  Her throw clinched it for her team and they were awarded the gumboot throwing competition trophy. Ryen Anderson, , who was on her team said: “Meghan was asking us how to throw and we said it doesn’t matter. “She didn’t know she could throw that far and she surprised herself. “She was really pleased we’d won and said next time we’ll have to do another one and Harry said next time ‘we’ll win’!” The couple arrived at north shore riding club after they’d flown from Wellington to Auckland in a RNZAF jet. Looking causal in a Karen Walker blazer and J Crew Jeans, Harry and Meghan had barely sat down in an open paddock before the heavens opened with torrential rain. They had been driven through some of the  hectares of native bush that the riding club had dedicated before they arrived for a welcome ceremony. Kaumata Joe Harawira led the formal welcomeafter the karainga had called the couple forward and they took their seats on white plastic chairs. James Guild, chairman of the QEII trust, equivalent of the UK’s National Trust and responsible for the QCC in New Zealand, have a lovely speech welcoming the couple and congratulating them on their forthcoming baby. “Perhaps some time in the future we will see Her Majesty’s great-grandchild back in Mew Zealand to check up on the covenant dedicated by his or her parents on their first trip to New Zealand together.” President of the Riding Club Adrianne Deeley proposed a round of applause for local campaigner Carole Whaley, after whom the forest was named. And she raised some laughs with her comments about her horse Harry.  She said: “I would have liked my harry to meet harry but I checked on his schedule and it’s pretty tight. It’ll have to be another time!”Harry then took to the stage and raised cheers with “my we and I...” He said: “The Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy – or QCC - is a unique network of forest conservation projects. “It was launched in , to mark my grandmothers long service to the Commonwealth and is an initiative that is dear to her heart – and now to mine. “As of last week,  out of the  Commonwealth countries have signed up to the QCC, with Kiribati being the most recent addition. “New Zealand was one of the first countries to join. And it has also shown great leadership in this area, inspiring other countries to follow, and leading by example. “It is fitting that New Zealand’s contribution to the Canopy has been through its relationship with the QEII National Trust. The Trust was set up to mark the Queen’s Silver Jubilee in . Since then, nearly four and a half thousand covenants have been registered through the Trust.”  After his speech, Harry and Meghan were invited to unveil the QCC plaque and plant two trees. Duchess Meghan planted a New Zealand kōwhai tree, which is one of the distinctive Kiwi flowers  chosen to represent the country embroidered on her wedding veil. Harry planted a puriri tree which can grow up up to m tall. Alex Chatterton, , from Pinehill Primary school said: “I planted a tree with Meghan. She asked me why I do this and told us to get started. “She was v good at first. “She said ‘oh do you want gloves’ but I don’t need them! They were nice caring and let you do whatever you want. “It was fun.” Meghan said to him: “I’ll shake your hands buddy! Doesn’t matter they’re dirty.”  Then it was onto the welly-wanging. Isabella Iti, , said: “She’s really pretty and stands for women’s rights. Our teachers have told us a lot about what she does and how she helps people. “It was important to plant trees as it helps the earth as trees give us oxygen and homes for native birds.“Meghan asked us what our favourite subjects was and Harry told jokes. “He tried to out the gloves [to plant the trees] but then chucked them off. He was good at planting the tree. The two teams were really trying. I think Harry and Meghan are quite competitive as they looked like they were REALLY trying to throw the gumboot as far as they could.  They did really good, particularly Meghan. I think Meghan was thinking there was no chance she could win but she did!!” Chairman of the QEII trust James guild,  said: “They are a very happy couple at the end of a long trip. I asked the duchessshe was tired and she said she wasn’t! She said she’d been misquoted! “We gave them four presents. “A mini pair of gumbouts for a three year old green with painted kiwis. “A baby shawl or pure New Zealand wool. Pounamu nz green stone on a chain and we actually put them on.“They were extremely grateful and they said they would be very useful. The duchess thought the gumboots were very cute. “Harry takes a farmer’s perspective with rain. He said it was a blessing.

He lost a lot of blood and fell into a coma, according to Save the Children. “The blood was everywhere it was a horrible scene I will never forget, he told the charity. I did not expect that the fish market would be targeted by the airstrikes. I always feel safe there but the airstrikes surprised me. When I was lying in the hospital I was thinking of my family and death. I was told that my friend who was selling water in the market was killed. A piece of shrapnel cut his head open while he was trying to escape.  My friend Hisham was only selling water in the market to help his family, just like me.” Ahmad is now recovering, but has still not been able to walk. The war in Yemen has been ongoing for three years - and has left the country in the worlds biggest humanitarian crisis. Children are the most badly affected. They face the threat of being hit by bombs, starvation and disease. Who is fighting who in the Yemen war  On one side of the war is the Houthi armed group - a rebel group linked to an Islamic sect - which was supported by some army units and armed groups loyal to late former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. On the other side is the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and supported by President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, which has carried out air strikes in Yemen. Members of the coalition include the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and Sudan, according to Amnesty International. The organisation says that the USA and UK have also been providing key intelligence and logistical support to the coalition.  Why and how the war began- a timeline In , the Arab spring protests undermined then president Ali Abdullah Salehs rule. The uproar led to splits in the army and allowed al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsulato seize swathes of territory in the east. In , Saleh stepped down in a political transition plan backed by Gulf states. Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi became interim president and oversaw a “national dialogue” to draft a more inclusive, federal constitution. In , AQAP survived military onslaught and drone strikes, staging attacks across the country while retaining a persistent presence. The following year saw the Houthis seize Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, with the help of Saleh.  In , Hadi tried to announce a new federal constitution opposed by the Houthis and Saleh, who arrested him. He escaped, pursued by the Houthis, triggering Saudi intervention in March along with a hastily assembled Arab military coalition. Months later, the coalition drove the Houthis and Saleh loyalists from Aden in south Yemen and Marib, northeast of Sanaa, but the front lines solidied, setting up years of stalemate. In , hunger grew as the coalition imposed a partial blockade on Yemen, accusing Iran of smuggling missiles to the Houthis through Hodeidah alongside food imports - something it has denied. Coalition air strikes that killed civilians prompted warnings from rights groups, but Western support for the military campaign continued. In , the Houthis launched missiles into Saudi Arabia. Seeing a chance to regain power for his family by withdrawing from his Houthi allies, Saleh switched sides, but was killed trying to escape them.  What has happened this year In , coalition-backed forces have advanced up the Red Sea coast against the Houthis, aiming to take the port of Hodeidah. This is the last main entry point for supplies into north Yemen. Hodeidah is a leline for goods and aid for  percent of Yemen’s population, and disruption to this port could put the lives of hundreds of thousands of children in immediate danger while pushing millions more into famine. The United Nations has warned that failure to keep food, fuel and aid flowing into Yemen, particularly through Hodeidah, could result in one of the worst hunger crises in living history. How many people have been affected  According to Amnesty International, more than , civilians have been killed and injured. But other reports suggest up to , Yemenis have been killed because of the war. Amnesty reports around three million people have been forced away from their homes because of the fighting. The organisation says . million people are in need of le-saving assistance including water, food and shelter. And a staggering .million children are out of school.  What do children hurt in the war say  Noran, whose name has been changed, is wheelchair bound after a wave from an airstrike damaged her spine. The -year-old says: “I used to go to school on foot, my le was beautul because I could walk and write. Now, I can’t walk to school. I can only go with the wheelchair. I used to be able to sit in a chair at my desk and write but now when I try to write, my hand hurts because of the injury in my back. I used to love writing, but now I can’t even hold a pen.” The latest - a surge in suspected cholera cases Suspected cholera cases have almost tripled in Yemen’s coastal Hodeidah region since fighting escalated in June. The World Health Organisation says that  per cent of all suspected cases are children under five years old. The rise in suspected cases in Hodeidah follows a dramatic increase in fighting between the Houthis and forces backed by the Saudi- and Emirati-led Coalition since June. Between  and  July, airstrikes resulted in the damage of a sanitation facility and water station that supplies Hodeidah with most of its water. Hodeidah is also home to nearly , severely malnourished children – more than a quarter of Yemen’s total. More than half a million people have been displaced from their homes in Hodeidah since June. They have been forced to live in host communities in cramped conditions, with little access to clean water and sanitation.  Shocking figures - One civilian killed every three hours in Yemen One civilian has been killed every three hours in fighting in Yemen since the beginning of August, with many more people succumbing to disease and hunger, Oxfam said last week. Muhsin Siddiquey, Oxfam’s Country Director in Yemen said: “Every single le lost to this shameful conflict, be it through armed attacks, or through starvation and disease, should be an international outrage. “Backers of all the warring parties should realise that they are complicit in this man-made crisis. Governments must comply with all international legal obligations to do their utmost to prevent civilian casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure. The international community urgently needs to do everything it can to get all sides in this war to agree a ceasefire.” On Wednesday an airstrike in Hudaydah killed at least  civilians in a vegetable market. Earlier this month  civilians including four children were killed and  others were injured when an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition hit two buses filled with passengers at a Houthi-held checkpoint to the south east of the city. A ground shelling at a camp for displaced people in southern Hudaydah killed a young woman and injured seven other people including six children. Sadly, the conflict continues.

Space reports that for several weeks, a European orbiter circling Mars has been watching the long cloud. The smoke has remained in place over a volcanic mountain called Arsia Mons near the Martian equator since September , according to a statement released by the European Space Agency. They said there are apparently no volcanic processes producing the cloud as the volcano hasnt been active in about  million years. Scientists say the same spacecraft, which is named Mars Express, and its predecessors have spotted similar clouds on at least three previous occasions, and those structures formed around the same time in the Martian year.  And thats not a coincidence, the ESA wrote. They pointed out the cloud is full of water ice and has been created by air flow along the side of the volcano. This means the feature is what scientists call an orographic or lee cloud. That also happens to mean that the cloud changes over the course of the day as atmospheric patterns on Mars change. Space added that scientists watching the cloud have noticed it grows over the course of the morning, stretching along the equator. It may also be affected by the dust still in the atmosphere from the massive dust storm that engulfed Mars earlier this year.

She was then hauled off the  by two female police officers while her partner was also whipped as punishment for standing too close to each other in public. The public punishment took place in the city of Banda Aceh - where Sharia law is strictly practised and enforced.  The crime of being in close proximity to someone of the opposite sex can be punished by up to  lashes. Other offences such as gay sex, adultery, drinking alcohol and gambling can result in up to  lashes. Aceh is the only province in the country to impose Islamic criminal law and was granted increasingly special powers in  when the government struck a deal with separatists.  Indonesia is one of the most largely populated Muslm countries in the world with more than  per cent of the  million inhabitants practising the faith. Earlier this year a bride-to-be and her fiance were also publicly thrashed in the same city, after being found guilty of getting too close. Closeness is seen as a step towards pre-martial sex which is against Sharia Law and as a result the couple each received  lashes, in front of gathering crowds.  The punishments take place outside a mosque and draw huge crowds, many of whom take pictures. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, two women aged  and  were caned for having lesbian sex in a car. The women were sentenced to six lashings each and a fine of pound despite a global outcry from activists who say the sentence has no place in any civilised society.

Training has been really good and I thinkyou asked any of the boys in the changing-room we’d all be the same.“It’s really gone up a level, we’re all enjoying it and I think that shows on a Saturday.“It’s been quite tough but I think we needed that. It’s been enjoyable at the same time, though, and we’re all buying into his ideas.”Off the field there seems to be an air of optimism around Tannadice but Booth knows getting results on the pitch is the only way to realise their hopes of promotion.And that means keeping their unbeaten run under the new boss going against a Dunfermline side that have already bagged a deserved win over the Tangerines.Booth added: “Four points from the first two games isn’t too bad but I think they were two good performances as well.“We feel hard done by we didn’t get the win over Inverness – I think most people there would agree with that but it wasn’t to be.“At least we put in a really positive performance and everyone is pulling in the same direction.“There is a good feel about the place and, hopefully, we can kick on now and go on a little run.“The players, coaching staff, fans all seem to be pulling in the same direction especially since the new gaffer has come in.“A thousand fans down at Partick, great backing and then same again last weekend. The fans were right with us until the last minute.“It does help, it makes a massive dference and Dunfermline isn’t too far down the road so I’d expect another good away following.“I think the fans can see the work and effort we’re putting in, evenwe didn’t get the three points last Saturday.“The fans have been great and long may it continue.”Allan Johnston’s Pars have been struggling of late after a lightning fast start to the season saw them follow up four wins from four in the Betfred Cup group stage with an impressive - victory at Tannadice.Since then, Dunfermline have only managed eight points from the following eight games and were beaten - at home last weekend despite dominating against Queen of the South.In fact, scoring goals at home has been a real problem of late with just the two Championship strikes going in.Booth  Co., however, are wary of a repeat show from the Pars.He said: “Dunfermline were really good at Tannadice the first time we played them and thoroughly deserved to win.“I think most people would be surprised they’ve not kicked on from that first game.“They played well that day and deserved the win.“I’ve not seen much of them since but it’s not worked out for them since for whatever reason.“They’ll still be a dangerous opponent, though, because they are, obviously, capable of putting in a performance but have just been a bit inconsistent recently.“If we go about it like we have done in the last two games then we’ll give ourselves a chance.“We’ll be going there in positive spirits, try to take our chances and come back up the road with the three

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain.

In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car.

first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers learn lifesaving first aid","story":"CDJFA groups have been learning basic first aid skills, from paramedic Lorne McArthur, which could help treat sports injuries.The youngster#s training included cleaning and bandaging up wounds, supporting broken bones, dealing with concussion and some CPR and  children in total took advantage of this opportunity.Imogen Todd practices resuscitation watched by other young players.

Dennis Meenan when the Casting the Net project bus sailed into town.Mario and Marek enjoy fishing for mackerel from Campbeltown#s old pier with Marek even smoking their catches himself.Dennis, who stars in a video filmed for the project, popped into the bus, which was in Campbeltown last week, at the same time as the youngsters and told them tales about the ring-net fishing industry, which largely died out in the early s.Dennis, who fished all his le from the age of , explained that two fishing boats would be used to cast a net around a shoal of herring before pulling together to create #a purse# which traps the fish.He said the real skill was not in catching the fish, but in finding them in the first place, at a time when there was no sonar.Nature was the most common guide with gannets, which feed on herring, and basking sharks, which eat the same plankton as the fish, giving away their location.Dennis explained that a single gannet once helped him land a massive catch which filled four boats, off the Tiree coast.Casting the Net, a collaborative project between the Clyde Fishermen#s Association and the Scottish Fisheries Museum, is an oral history project capturing the memories and experiences of the last remaining Clyde ring-net fishermen.The bus, bought on eBay, has been transformed into the project#s mobile hub.Jill de Fresnes, from the Clyde Fishermen#s Association, talked to countless fishermen, including Dennis, carrying out video interviews and collecting clips, photographs and other artacts on display on the bus.Artist Deirdre Nelson transformed

The use of recycling boxes rather than bins and the introduction of food waste caddies has helped the county produce high-quality waste with fewer contaminants, meaning less has to be sent for treatment.Now Mr Reid wants to bring a similar approach to travel in the county as East Lothian prepares for an influx of new residents due to a plethora of new housing developments.And he revealed talks were under way to try and replace the councilrsquos refuse collection vehicles with electric versions as it looks to lead by example.He said: ldquoThe public bought into recycling because we gave them options such as the food waste bins and also because they knew it was the right thing to do.ldquoActive travel will be an evolution but we need to give people access to it. We need to provide cycle paths and safe walkways we need train services to be on time. If we can develop plans to provide these services then people will automatically select not to take the car, just as they will select electric vehicles as they become cheaper too.ldquoIt is about getting the message out and empowering people to be able to do it.The introduction of electric bin lorries would be a huge step towards improving the environment and changing public perception.Some such lorries are being trialled in England by waste recycling firms, with one company in Sheffield introducing two vehicles which are powered by burning non-recyclable rubbish as they collect it. Others are being tested using rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe are actively working with partners to deliver one of the first fully electric refuse collection vehicles that would be powered through renewable energy currently generated on site at Kinwegar [recycling centre near

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them.

But there already is a bottleneck of would-be asylum seekers waiting at some US border crossings to make their claims, some waiting as long as five weeks.Mr McAleenan said the aim of the operation was to deter migrants from crossing illegally, but he conceded his officers were overwhelmed by a surge of asylum seekers at border crossings.

But there is also a fake Douglas, a counterfeit  Main Street, one that only exists online: the HQ, among other things, of a global corporation with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Copenhagen and beyond.This particular make-believe version of the draperrsquos shop has a two-storey glass and steel atrium, huge open-planned rooms and an army of hipster staff in designer glasses.It is, at least according to its own website, the Londonoffice of Falcon Business Services, an international ldquocreative advertising agency working for blue-chip clients like Starbucks, HM, Boeing, Cisco and even disgraced mogul Harvey Weinsteinrsquos now bankrupt movie-making concern.Falconrsquos internet offering may look slick ndashauthentic, it would be by far the biggest and most successful business in Scotlandrsquos under-pressure advertising sector ndash but the sitersquos gobbledygook English gives its fakery away.ldquoWe appreciate every culture, we are consist from many dferent culture from many country around the worlds, the agency boasts on its site about its ldquoLondon HQ in Douglas. ldquoThis place very big and cozy, this is our main office consist of large amount of employee across the world.How Falcon portrays its HQ, screen grab of its websiteBack at the real  Main Street, Lilli Clark bursts out laughing when she hears how Falcon describes her surroundings. Clark, with friend Sally Kerr, runs a small book-keeping practice at the old shop, including a ldquovirtual office where a Falcon Business Services is, indeed, registered.The pair find themselves on the edge of the surreal world of Scotlandrsquos notorious ldquotax haven firms: of ghost companies of here-today, gone-tomorrow anonymously owned corporate entities. That is because their address is the registered HQ of thousands of businesses, many created as global criminals exploit Britainrsquos lax and barely policed corporate transparency laws.Most are Scottish limited partnerships or SLPs, a kind of shell firm which anti-corruption campaign Transparency International describes as ldquoa vehicle of choice for money-laundering.Falcon is an SLP. There is no way of knowing who owns the business, how much money it turns over or evenit has anything to do with the website in its name.This, for Clark, is not funny. Because it means her address does not just feature on shlocky websites: it also stars in some of the worldrsquos biggest crime stories.Two years ago The Herald revealed ldquonumber  was the official home of firms at the centre of a major Ukrainian investigation in to allegedly corrupt side-payments on an arms export to the Middle East. Since then Douglas shell firms have rarely been out of the news.Clark stresses she knows nothing about any of the firms using her address. ldquoWe have no control over them whatsoever, she explains. ldquoWe want to get rid of them but we canrsquot.She sighs as she hears the latest on Douglas SLPs. That is because they number among a series of UK shell firms ndash with no identiable real world connection to Britain ndash which The Herald on Sunday has identied as being behind supposedly multi-million-dollar investments in the tyrannical Central Asian state of Uzbekistan.Just one SLP, called Quality Trade Supplies or QTS, is building a steel mill in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, for just over  million euros. This ldquoBritish investment was announced by Uzbekistanrsquos president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, with an official visit to its -hectare site, which, unlike Falconrsquos global HQ, is very real.Presidential press releaseTwo decades after the closure of Ravenscraig, a Scottish company is again investing in steel, albeit overseas. Or is it The Herald on Sunday has made multiple attempts to contact QTS, whose website says it has a representative office in Kazakhstan, as well as its official home at  Main Street, Douglas. We wanted to ask QTS who its owner was. The firm has failed to comply with new UK rules under which last year it should have named any ultimate beneficiary or PSC ndash a ldquoperson of signicant control.The firmrsquos website says the Tashkent Metallurgical Plant is a ldquostate project ndash while the state itself says it is a QTS project. The stated investment is one of the biggest carried out by a Scottish enterprise overseas in recent years.QTS on its site also said it was also building a km railway line with  stops across Kazakhstan, part of a major drive to improve transport links between China and Europe. That job, it said, would involve  construction workers. Again, this would be a nearly unprecedented venture for a Scottish firm.Uzbeks also have questions about who owns QTS. One prominent former Soviet oligarch has been named locally as being behind the firm. A London public relations firm acting on his behalf has denied any connection.Mirziyoyev has also given his official blessing ndash and visit ndash to another major ldquoBritish investment from a Douglas firm, a m cement factory in the underdeveloped western Uzbek region of Karakalpakstan.Shavkat MirziyoyevUzbekistanrsquos Ministry of Economy formally lists ldquoforeign investments in infrastructure or industry every year. These include a roll-call of SLPs with either opaque ownership or PSCs filed in the name of untraceable Uzbeks. At least five other Douglas SLPs are named in press reports or official bulletins as recent investors. None have transparent ownership or any real-world links to Lanarkshire.Uzbek authorities have also named a series of English and Welsh shell firms, mostly limited liability partnerships or LLPs, as ldquoforeign investors.Take Fortalia Consult, a now struck-off LLP. It put up m for a .m factory making washing machines, fridges and cookers. The plant, partly funded by the state National Bank of Uzbekistan, employed hundreds. LLPs have to provide more information on Britainrsquos corporate registry, including accounts. Fortalia, in its last year of existence, , made an operating profit of pound on a turnover of just over pound,. A company investing millions in a white appliances factory made a profit of under a tenner. It did, however, file a PSC. She was Uzbek.Official bulletins, government press releases and state-controlled media reports suggest SLPs and LLPs whose owners are either Uzbeks or unknown have made declared ldquoforeign direct investments of well over poundm in recent years.Other investments officially made by SLPs and LLPs are in real-world factories making everything from spinning equipment to probiotic dairy produce.One of the businesses investing in a major new business district, Tashkent City, is an Edinburgh SLP called Corso Solutions. Corso was created last year but has failed to comply with new rules under which it was supposed to say who its owner is. Fines for failure to comply are pound a day. None has ever been levied.TashkentHuman rights campaigners ndash Uzbek and international ndash have grave concerns about this. They want to know who is buying up chunks of the countryrsquos economy. They are especially concerned about equity and other investments in cotton, the nationrsquos biggest industry.Uzbekistan is currently reforming its cotton farms, which have a record of forced labour ndash slavery, effectively ndash and environmental abuses which have led to the near-disappearance of one of the worldrsquos biggest lakes, the Aral Sea. But reforms are only just beginning. They include partial privatisations that have seen SLPs and English shell firms buy stakes in both processing and picking enterprises.CottonTwo, Trontex of Stirling and Gratum Trading of Edinburgh, received import tax breaks under a Mirziyoyev decree. Both firms, like QTS, have filed at Companies House saying they have not yet attempted to identy a PSC.The Herald on Sunday has written to both Mirziyoyevrsquos press office in Tashkent and the Uzbek Embassy in London. We askedthe president knew who the beneficiaries of his tax breaks were. There was no reply. We also wrote askinghe was concerned that major ldquoforeign investors were failing to reveal who they were. Again, there was no reply.This worries Umida Niyazova. She is a journalist and campaigner who was jailed under Mirziyoyevrsquos predecessor, the authoritarian Islam Karimov. Now based in Berlin, she leads the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights .She says: ldquoThe cotton sector in Uzbekistan is entirely under the control of the state which sets the price of cotton and is the sole beneficiary of revenue from sales on the international market.\"Umida NiyazovaShe adds: ldquoUGF has been monitoring and reporting on state-organised forced labour in Uzbekistanrsquos cotton sector for over eight years. We can confirm that, despite some changes, mass mobilization of forced labour and extortion from organisations and employees to pay for cotton pickers is again ongoing during this yearrsquos cotton harvest, despite Mirziyoyevrsquos public commitments to eradicate it.ldquoFor decades, the production of cotton has been underpinned by a system ... in which Uzbekistanrsquos citizens are forcibly mobilised to pick cotton. This is a state-operated system of forced labour, in which the Uzbek government imposes regional cotton production quotas which are, in turn, allocated by regional officials to their sub-districts.ldquoRegional and district officials are responsible for meeting these quotas under threat of penalty.ldquoWe have observed a proleration of Uzbek entities registered as limited partnerships in Scotland and England, including a number of companies with direct ties to the cotton industry.ldquoWe are interested to know why these companies, in receipt of large swathes of foreign direct investment, want to register in Scotland. Why do these companies not disclose their ownership  Given that hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign direct investment are flowing into the country at this time, the UK government must ensure these companies are not a vehicle for money laundering.ldquoUzbekistanrsquos cotton sector has already disrupted the lives of millions. It would be criminalthey were to be robbed of revenue which should ultimately benefit the Uzbek people.Abandoned ships on the dried-out Aral SeaUzbek sources stress they have no evidence SLPs or LLPs investing in cotton or other industries are responsible for human rights abuses. Nor do they have evidence any nominally UK registered firms are fronts for government officials or others who wish to conceal their identities. They just want to know who is behind investment. They have reason to be concerned. SLPs have been widely abused where in the former Soviet Union, including as part of multi-billion-dollar schemes to launder money out of Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.At last count, some  Uzbeks were named as the PSCs of SLPs. But multiple investigations reveal closer links. A nephew of former leader Islam Karimov in  was named as the effective controller of SLPs involved in a dispute over the ownership of hotels in Riga which culminated in an attempted gangland-style hit.Last year an international journalistic investigation alleged that Karimovrsquos youngest daughter, Lola, and her husband used three SLPs ndash two of which, Five Star Star Technology Support and Greenhall Management, are based in Douglas ndash as part of complex offshore scheme. None of the SLPs has named a PSC.Lola Karimova, from Getty ImagesMs Karimova is a multi-millionaire who last year launched her own fragrance at a party at the Cannes Film Festival attended by Juliette Binoche, Catherine Deneuve, Kristin Scott Thomas and Pamela Anderson.She denies detailed allegations of tax avoidance set out by journalists at a group called The Black Sea.This month Britainrsquos Serious Fraud Office announced it had begun a proceeds of crime investigation against Ms Karimovarsquos estranged elder sister, Gulnara, once touted as a replacement for her father.She is in prison near Tashkent on embezzlement charges, which she denies. British authorities are understood to be seeking to confiscate London properties linked to her and an associate. Swiss authorities have already seized some m in assets.Gulnara Karimova, from Getty ImagesMeanwhile, as The Herald revealed this year, The United Nations Development Programme has blacklisted five SLPs amid concerns over international aid fraud in Uzbekistan. The sanctions are against SLPs called Special Alliance Partnership, Investment Affairs, Trident Asia and Five Star Commercial Services.They are all registered either at  Main Street, or a flat in Edinburghrsquos Montgomery Street, number .The owners of this property, like Clark and Kerr, once ran a virtual office business. They too stress they have no control over the entities registered at what is their home. They also have tried and failed to get SLPs de-registered.Some SLPs have been transferred from Montgomery Street to Douglas. They include Tashkent steel mill builder QTS, whose website still has a map showing its Edinburgh HQ.Montgomery Street, EdinburghThe Montgomery Street flat has been the base for SLPs which played a key role in the -billion Russian Laundromat, one of the biggest and most elaborate money-laundering schemes ever uncovered.:A Baltic bank, a Belarussian bribe and a British embarrassmentNow government investigators in Argentina allege two SLPs using the address were used as part of one of the worldrsquos biggest bribery scandals.Earlier this year The Herald revealed the role played by Scottish shell firms in complex offshore structures used by a construction giant called Odebrecht to pay kickbacks to officials and politicians across Latin America and beyond. The so-called ldquomega scandal ndash nearly bn was paid out, Odebrecht admits ndash has rocked the western hemisphere and led to prosecutions against senior officials in multiple jurisdictions.A former president of Peru, who denies using an SLP based at a Glasgow law firm to take money infor a highway contract, is among those facing prosecution. A senior state oil official close to the outgoing president of Mexico also dismisses reports he took money from the construction firm through SLPs.In Argentina, government anti-corruption investigators have focused on a prominent entrepreneur called Jorge Rodriacuteguez, though he usually goes by the nickname ldquoCorcho, or ldquoCork.In a ldquobox office celebrity court case, Rodriacuteguez is accused of taking in bribes from Odebrecht, which was among companies bidding to build a metro line. He denies any wrongdoing.Corcho Rodriacuteguez, from YouTubeAn Argentinian government report suggests money was transferred the tax haven bank accounts of two SLPs to Uruguay. From there, investigators allege, Rodriacuteguez used his fleet of private plans to fly money in cash across the River Plate to a small airfield near Buenos Aires. Figures of up to m have been cited.The two SLPs named in official papers are Latin Financial and Capital Investment Enterprises, both of which were created and dissolved without ever filing any meaningful paperwork. Rodriacuteguez says he has no connection with the two Scottish firms. His Uruguayan accountants, in testimony, say they were his.The case continues. Rodriacuteguez ndash often described as a lobbyist ndash was part of a politically-linked Buenos Aires jetset often seen in the Uruguayan resort of Punto del Este.His we, Veroacutenica Lozano, hosts a chat show on Argentinian TV. His ex, former s film star Susana Gimeacutenez, has an even bigger rival programme and her own monthly glossy magazine, on whose cover she always features.Susana GimeacutenezAn Odebrecht official in Brazil, Marcio Faria do Bentos, earlier this year said there had been a smooth flow of illicit payments to Argentina until former president Neacutestor Kirchner died in  while his we, Cristina, ran Argentina. The system, Faria said, started ldquoticking smoothly again after he was contacted by Rodriacuteguez.Anti-corruption campaigners are more than aware of the absurdity of linking the fleshpots of Punta del Este or Cannes with Montgomery Street flat, with a derelict phone box in its front garden, or a Lanarkshire draperrsquos shop.The Buenos Aires metroBut Scotland ndash and the UK ndash is part of a world-wide machine for washing dirty money. Our SLPs and our LLPs are like the Swiss banks of old, the means to hide illicit wealth with a veil of British respectability.Graham Barrow, UK-based money-laundering expert, has been slowly but surely unpicking and exposing the system in a series of detailed essays. The Uzbek and Argentinian cases, he says, ldquohighlight yet again that this is a global problemwhich can only be solved by a global effort.But he adds: ldquoThe UK can make a huge contribution by better regulating these entities so that they donrsquot keep cropping up in far flung corners of the world for all the wrong reasons.

The Herald on Sunday tried to contact Falcon. All its contact details were bogus, its telephone was , its fax . Britain has still to get the number of its fake firms.So what are SLPs SCOTTISH Limited Partnerships, to give them their proper name, were once just a means for farmers to share fields.Then some lawyers figured out such structures made tax-efficient vehicles for managing equity funds. And others realised they were also enticing for people who want to avoid more than just tax.Writer Oliver Bullough has explored the murky world of international offshore finance ndash and its effect on some of the planetrsquos poorest nations ndash for his book Moneyland. He has long watched SLPs being abused.ldquoSLPs and shell structures like them are absolutely crucial to anyone who has wealth to hide, he explains. ldquoWithout them, it would be impossible for crooks and thieves ndash whether theyrsquore rulers of former Soviet states, or leaders of drugs cartels ndash to move their wealth out of the shadows and into the legitimate economy.\"Bulloughs bookHe adds: ldquoSLPs are useful to crooks because, unlike limited partnerships where in the UK, they have legal personality and thus can own bank accounts and other assets, enter into contracts, and take on debt. If the SLPrsquos partners are offshore companies, then their ownership is completely opaque.ldquoThe great advantage of Britain as a place to register a company is that the company looks legitimate, because itrsquos British, but really is not. Our money-laundering regime is so lax, and Companies House doesnrsquot check the accuracy of any information supplied to it. This is why British structures are almost iniably found in the biggest financial scandals.The abuse of SLPs, Bullough stresses, is not a victimless crime. ldquoMore than a trillion dollars a year is stolen from the worldrsquos poorest countries, devastating their economies and spreading misery and destitution, he says. ldquoThat would not be possible without shell structures like SLPs, and itrsquos imperative the UK Government acts to reform them to they can no longer be misused in this way.A map of just some of the SLP scandals in recent yearsA spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"The UK is leading the global fight against money laundering. \"Changes to the law last year have increased the transparency of these financial arrangements, reducing the likelihood of them being used for illegal purposes.ldquoWe carefully developed our recent reforms to further prevent these crimes without harming the legitimate businesses and pensions that invest through limited partnerships.Registrations of SLPs have fallen in the last year after new PSC reguilations were introduced and, crucially, banks in Latvia started refusing to handle their accounts.Comment: Alison Thewliss on why SLP reform cannot waitMore than three months have passed since the UK Government closed its consultation on the reform of limited partnerships, and despite calls for recommendations to be published, nothing has been forthcoming.Today we see yet more evidence linking limited partnerships to opprobrious behaviour abroad this time with regards cotton production in Uzbekistan.Agencies such as Amnesty International, and the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights, have gone to great s to expose the coercive and manipulative nature of this industry.Alison ThewlissThe purported involvement of financial vehicles registered in the UK ndash with little or no information offered on ultimate ownership ndash should be of serious concern to UK Government Ministers.Unfortunately, thatrsquos not likely to be the case as far as the UK Government is concerned. A volley of evidence has been sent their way, but met only with indference.The UK Government must take a firm stance on limited partnerships being used to fund corrupt activities and perpetuate human-rights abuses, and stop ignoring the scandal that is continuing to take place on their doorstep.Alison Thewliss is the SNP MP for Glasgow Central"},{"url":null,"title":"lord-adonis-scottish-labour-should-lead-the-way-in-calling-for-a-brexit-vote","story":"Now, though, we are in the fight of our lives to stop this Brexit mess.

Our leaders now need to lead or young people in particular will turn away in disgust, outraged that their voices are being ignored, astonished that , people marching on Parliament have not been heeded.Over the last three days I have been with young people in Aberdeen, Perth, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Their message is a stark warning to Labour. Listen to us or face the consequences at the ballot box.Across the UK, Labour is in danger of alienating our voters, supporters and members by looking like followers on Brexit rather than the leaders people expect us to be. Nowhere is that more true than here in Scotland. Polls show that two-thirds of Scottish voters want a Peoplersquos Vote. This includes virtually every group and every city and region of the nation. Among Labour supporters in Scotland backing for a peoplersquos vote rises to  percent.So here is what needs to happen. Labour needs to lead not follow. In Scotland, Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems and the Greens should make common cause against Brexit. There is a historic opportunity for Scottish Labour to show that - far from being a lsquobranch officersquo - it can inspire the party across the UK and change UK-wide policy.Urgently, Scottish Labour should say to Jeremy Corbyn that a Peoplersquos Vote cannot be the least worst option in terms of party policy but must be the vow that Labour makes to voters. Nicola Sturgeonrsquos big, bold offer to trust voters in Scotland and beyond on Brexit is a wake up call to Scottish Labour. But it is also an opportunity. Scottish Labour now needs to step up and stand up for the voters - and the nation.Lord Adonis is a Labour peer"},{"url":null,"title":"working-for-pennies-a-minute-the-merciless-reality-of-employment-in-modern-scotland","story":"The details have emerged as part of a wider investigation into the gig economy, and precarious and insecure employment in Scotland.Other findings include:bull At least  per cent of the total Scottish workforce ndash some , people ndash deemed to be in insecure employment.bull Concerns that some social enterprises ndash firms meant to provide a social good and often in receipt of support from the taxpayer ndash are engaged in questionable employment practices.bull The rise of \"bogus self-employment\" where firms bring staff onboard, including waitresses and baristas, under self-employed terms ndash thereby not paying tax, national insurance, holiday pay, sick pay, or pension contributions ndash but treat them on the same terms asthey were staffbull Evidence of cash-in-hand payments used routinely in the gig economy, raising questions about losses to the exchequer.Trade union activists have described some of the worst examples of precarious employment as \"Dickensian\", \"Victorian\" and a throwback to the relationship between factory owners and workers in the th century. They also called on the Scottish government to tackle the problem with action, not words.The \"paid by the minute\" scandal centres on the care industry where councils outsource care at home to private or charitable companies. Care staff are electronically monitored ndash clocking in and out of a clientrsquos home ndash using technology such as mobile phones or iPads.As an example,a carer has five jobs in an hour each lasting six minutes then they will be paid by the minute for a total of  minutes. If the worker is on the Scottish living wage ndash pound. an hour ndash this would see them earn approximately pound. for an hourrsquos work, or just under  pence per minute. Many are not paid for the time in between jobs, or for travel to and from jobs.Scottish Care, which represents private care providers, estimates that the practice of \"paying by the minute\" occurs in half of Scotlandrsquos  council areas. An estimated  per cent ndash or  people ndash of the private care workforce, which stands at ,, are on zero-hours contracts, where most of the \"paid by the minute\" work is found. However, the numbers on ZHCs rises to - per cent in the sector of \"older peoplersquos care\".Care providers and carers are also penalisedworkers stay over the allotted time per visit, in the event of a client being ill or distressed.Scottish Care said: ldquoOver the last few years Scottish Care has continually argued for improvements to conditions which make employment in the care sector precarious for too many iniduals. One of these is the call to offer properly funded contracts to providers to enable them to reduce dependency on zero-hour contracts ... While admittedly some staff desire the flexibility that such contracts provide them with, from our research the vast majority of providers wish to move to a situation where adequate funding makes full-time contracts for the care workforce a possibility.ldquoThe main reason for the existence of zero-hours contracts is the discriminatory practice around the way in which care is bought from charitable and private providers by the public authorities. A local authority only pays for the work which is done rather than what may be intended. This makes it impossible to guarantee hours for many, especially smaller care providers.\"Scottish Care believes that we need to radically change the way we commission and buy care services ... At the moment many, especially smaller organisations, are effectively paid by the minute and therefore by extension unless the provider has its own reserves and assets the worker is paid by the minute. This is no way to deliver care in the st century.ldquoWe are faced with a scenario where workers are pressurised to get tasks done in as quick a time as possible and are penalisedthey are late for their next client. For the person receiving the care this makes the whole experience less than dignied despite the best efforts of inidual care workers ... This is especially unacceptable when we are talking about supporting people with palliative and end-of-le care.Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said: \"There is something very wrong about a local authority treating its own staff fairly and well and yet treating the staff of services they buy in, whether they are employed by a charity or private care provider, in a manner which is little less than exploitative. Workers are made to clock in and clock out and their organisations are only being paid by the minute, and even thena worker is late or stays longer because someone needs more help or is ill they are being penalised.ldquoThese electronic call monitoring systems are treating care staff asthey cannot be trusted. They do not give dignity or value to a critical workforce. If we ever want to create a fair system of work we need a fair system for commissioning care.\"We have a massive challenge to attract people to do the fundamentally important job of care. People are being put off because of unfair conditions imposed by local authorities upon care organisations. How can we expect human-rights-based care in Scotland when we have created a system which denies the basic rights to the care worker and their employer \"Jim McCourt, one of Scotlandrsquos most prominent trade unionists who runs the Inverclyde Advice and Employment Rights Centre in Greenock, brought the issue of care workers being paid by the minute to the attention of The Herald on Sunday.\"Itrsquos the ultimate in the gig economy,\" says McCourt. He blamed the issue on care providers bidding against each other for council contracts and creating ldquoa race to the bottom in the market. ldquoThey bid with prices they canrsquot meet and it is their workers who suffer,\" he said.\"These private care companies are funded by the public purse as they are contracted by councils ndash so our tax pounds are propping up this system,\" said McCourt, adding: \"This is about looking after the most vulnerable people in society. We are looking at a value set here ndashpeople think there is money to be made in this way out of caring for the sick and elderly then there is something very wrong, especiallythe public purse is being used.\"One of Scotlandrsquos most senior care officials, who wished to speak anonymously, described the practice as \"hypocritical and obscene\".\"To impose penalties because a care worker has stayed longer than was thought necessary with a client who is distressed or unwell is the very antithesis of what the care profession is about. We donrsquot treat nurses like. This is the worst type of precarious employment. The current system needs to end.A spokesperson for Cosla, the Scottish council umbrella organisation, said: ldquoCouncils work closely with the providers in their area to deliver and commission social care services. Inidual employers are responsible for their own practices but Cosla is trying to create an environment in which social care can be seen as an increasingly attractive career.\"This requires social care workers to be rewarded fairly and valued by their employers as well as by the rest of society.A spokesperson for the Care Inspectorate, which regulates care in Scotland, said: ldquoThe Care Inspectorate works closely with care providers to ensure that care in Scotland is as good as it can be. We expect everyone who relies on care at home to experience good-quality care which meets their needs and respects their rights and choices. Where care needs to improve we can, and do, use a wide range of powers to ensure this happens.ldquoWe also expect all care providers to adhere to all relevant professional guidance and standards.

Will they help stimulate investment, productivity and employment  Will they favour particular sectors or income groups across the UK Second, we need to work through the implications for public spending in Scotland. Which changes will affect Scotland directly and which will work their way through the system via the block grant Third, we must consider implications for those tax powers, in particular income tax, which are largely devolved. At the least there can be effects on the base line from which adjustments for Scotland can be developed.As ever these days the new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibilitywere critical - as will be the case in Decemberrsquos Scottish Budget with the independent forecasts from the Scottish Fiscal Commission .There was little change in the GDP growth forecast ndash tiny increases for next year and the year after but from then on as we were. The key point to emphasise is that UK growth is set to remain muted, .% per annum maximum rather than the % or .% we should be seeking.But the good news from the OBR was that they expect stronger employment and sustained growth in real wages in each of the next five years. After such an extended period of decline in real wages this,achieved, will be really positive for households across Scotland.In advance of the Budget there were estimates that, thanks to strong tax revenues, the fiscal deficit for   was likely to come in some billions of pounds below prior expectations ndash giving scope for expenditure increases. The stronger than expected performance in tax revenue is now expected to continue. However, Mr Hammond appears to have flexed up and to be prepared to live with a deficit each year of around pound billion, close on % of GDP. Nevertheless the level of UK debt will fall below forecast. He claims he will meet his fiscal rules while at the same time he also claiming that lsquothe era of austerity is finally coming to an endrsquo.Most of the public expenditure changes announced do not relate to Scotland directly, but will feed through via upward adjustments in the block grant. The Chancellor tells us that the feed through will mean an uplt for Scotland of pound million in   and lsquomuch largerrsquo increases in years to come.That will be good news for Derek Mackay and team. But they must make their own judgements on how to allocate these funds ndash taking note perhaps of what is proposed in England but following their own priorities.The changes in income tax allowances announced in the Budget will cause pause for thought. The increases in personal rate allowance and the higher rate threshold have been brought forward to April .Increasing dferentials between Scottish income tax rates and those in the rest of the UK would have fiscal and ndash potentially ndash economic incentive implications.Mr Hammond did stress his desire to unleash business investment and announced measures which he hopes will stimulate activity, and which will apply in Scotland. There is an increase in the annual business investment allowance more support for UK exporters and more funds for the British Business Bank. Not massive but helpful.We must now await whatever emerges in the Scottish Budget on th December. But, as Mr Hammond himself has made clear, a lsquono deal Brexitrsquo would mean that all Budget bets are off.

The UK government is only borrowing around poundbn this year instead of going on poundbn. It seems that the real culprit was the Office of National Statistics which has been under-estimating the size of the UK economy and the tax revenues that it generates. In many businesses, an accounting error of such magnitude might be a sacking offence.But this is government, where no one is to blame. And anyway the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is cock-a-hoop as they used to say in football commentaries, at his windfall. It has allowed him to declare the end of austerity, cut taxesby bringing forward the raising of the higher rate tax threshold, throw a couple of billion at the broken-backed Universal Credit welfare reforms , and promise poundbn for the National Health Service.It was the ultimate get out of free card for ldquoFiscal Phil as he styled himself yesterday in a Budget that was long on gagsrather shorter on reality. Austerity has not of course ended, eventhe deficit is set to rise marginally next year, for the first time in a decade. The freeze on working age benefits, like job seekers allowance, has another year to run, and local councils are still grinding through spending constraints that has led some of them to go bust, in England at least.But relief is at hand. The Chancellor made a groan-worthy bid for tabloid headlines by announcing business rates relief on public conveniences. Britain may be about to go down the toilet after Brexit, but at least well be able to spend a penny without that adding to the cuts in social care.ldquoIts the only thing that hasnt leaked, he quipped, in what sounded like a dig at the Prime Minister. Theresa May had pre-announced many of the headline items in the Chancellors Budget, like the freeze on fuel duty and the extra for the NHS. Which, as a number of analysts pointed out, isnt all that earth-shattering at .% per annum. The increases in NHS spending under Labour were far greater than that.But of course, according to the Chancellor, austerity was all the fault of Gordon Brown throwing our money down the pan in his Venezuelan years. You might have thought that the  financial crisis was caused by excessive bank-lending, sub-prime mortgages and the behaviour of the likes of Fred Goodwin of RBS. But no, it was ldquoLabours Great Recession, according to Mr Hammond yesterday.Jeremy Corbyn was furious about that in his Budget response in the Commons, which as usual failed to soar to oratorical heights eventhe indignation meter was off the scale. The Leader of the Opposition was also furious about the Chancellors claim that ldquoincome inequality is less today than under any of the last Labour governments.This is actually true ndash in a way. The bottom % of earners have indeed seen their earnings increase faster than the top %. But this is largely because median wages have been frozen for the last decade, while there have been signicant increases in the Living Wage ndash up to pound. after yesterdays hike. So, it is more statistical than real, and is actually a measure of how poorly the economy has performed for middle Britain ndash the very ldquohard-working families the Chancellor appealed to yesterday.Indeed, you could almost say that the relative increase in the earnings of the bottom % has largely been paid for by the longest pay pause in  years. It doesnt alter the fact that the top  richest families in the UK have doubled their wealth since the crash, or that CEOs now earn  times the average pay of their employees. The inconvenient truth is that people on higher incomes have done extremely well since the crash and will continue to benefit disproportionately from the Chancellors windfall.It will also help Mr Hammonds Scottish equivalent, Derek Mackay, out of his own budgetary hole. That poundbn for the NHS should push around poundbn north through the magic of Barnett Consequentials. It couldnt come at a better time. Following Audit Scotlands report last week saying that the Scottish NHS was ldquounsustainable, Nicola Sturgeons hard-won reputation for sound management of the health service was beginning to look distinctly shoogly. Wisely, Mr Mackay has promised to put every penny of the UK NHS uplt into health, where it belongs. Its not entirely clear that the Scottish government has always done this in the past, evenit has kept health spending ahead of inflation.The Chancellor said that Scotland stood to gain nearly poundbn in extra cash next year alone, when other factors were included. The slashing of business rates by one third for small companies will also have lucrative consequentials, though Mr Mackay isnt quite so certain that this will all be handed on. To be fair, the Scottish government has led the way in helping small businesses weather the storm on the high streets. Its long-running small business bonus kept many village shops from going under, and it seems that the UK government has noticed.There will be no changes to tax reliefs on North Sea Oil industry which will also come as a relief to the Scottish Finance Secretary. And there is no increase in whisky duty, to allow us to have ldquoa wee dram for Ruth Davidson as he Chancellor put it. What he didnt say is that we may need a drop of the hard stuff to deal with Brexit.This was the oddest Budget I think Ive witnessed. This is partly because of the unreality of the underlying fiscal figures: I mean,the OBR can get its numbers so massively wrong this year, isnt it possible that, in future, it may make a similar mistake the other way But it is also the last Budget before everything changes on th March next year as Britain crashes out of the European Union. The Chancellor hardly mentioned Brexit in his speech, except to offer the alliterative forecast of a ldquodouble deal idend. He gave no indication of how this might materialise, or how it squared with his own Treasurys forecasts of the negative impact on the UK economy of leaving the single market.Philip Hammond has made clear that his Budget only worksthere is a favourable Chequers deal, guaranteeing friction-free trade with the EU. That looks distinctly unlikely. On the very day of the Budget speech, the former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, penned another epistle in the Dailycalling on his Tory colleagues to ldquochuck Chequers which he believes will leave Britain at the mercy of malign Brussels bureaucrats, determined to bring Britain down.We may look back on this Budget as the last of its kind before Britain enters a new era of extreme economic turbulence and self-inflicted uncertainty.

This will cost pound. billion annually once the roll-out of UC is complete.Mr Hammond said: ldquoThat will benefit . million working families with children and people with disabilities by pound per year.ldquoUniversal credit is here to stay, and we are putting in the funding it needs to make it a success because, on this side of the House, we believe that work should always pay.Mr Corbyn accused the Chancellor of \"reversing barely half the cuts made\" to the welfare system.He said: \"When even the Work and Pensions Secretaryadmits that some people will be worse off, and the architect of universal credit says the system is underfunded, it was inevitable that the Chancellor would have to act, though he is only reversing barely half the cuts made.\"However, the problems with universal credit are also structural, harming the self-employed, lone parents, people with larger families and survivors of domestic abuse. That is why we believe the roll-out must be halted immediately.\"He accused the Government of \"cutting social security for disabled people\" and \"slashing services to the bone\" while handing tax giveaways to corporations and the super-rich.He said: \"Far from tackling the burning injustices, as the Prime Minister said her Government were going to do, they have actually made them worse and increased the injustices in our society.\"The Equality and Human Rights Commission warned just last week that Britain is becoming a two-speed society mdash all right for the richest few and failing the many.\"This Government are harsh on the weak and feeble with the strong. They labelled good people scroungers and skivers while they imposed punitive sanctions, demeaning assessments and a benefits freeze, none of which has been reversed today.\"John Dickie, director of the Child Poverty Action Groupin Scotland, said the increase in work allowances was ldquogood news\" for families receiving UC, but insisted a \"bigger salvage operation is still needed for the benefit.He added: ldquoThis is crunch time for UC. The positive announcements on work allowances need to be followed by a pause in its roll-out to allow for a fundamental review of its design and, crucially, a commitment to restore all the money thatrsquos been taken out of it.Mr Dickie also criticised the failure to end the wider benefits freeze, arguing it is driving rising child poverty in Scotland and across the UK.Mr Hammondrsquos announcement comes just days after the Trussell Trust ndash which has  food banks across Scotland ndash blamed UC for a massive increase in starving families desperately turning to charities for food.It said the level of need was now \"unsustainable\", with demand soaring by up to  per cent at some of its centres.SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, who will deliver his own Budget for Scotland in December, said the changes announced to UC \"do not go far enough\".He added: \"They are just a drop in the ocean compared to the impact the roll-out of Universal Credit will have.

Itrsquos possible he kept this collection as a research tool.ldquoThese are images we really should treasure.Dr Marshall was born in Leith in , and became minister of Kirkgate Church in . He was regarded as an authority on the area, and went on to complete a doctorate on the portrsquos history.He later moved to St Andrews, and died in , aged .Yet even he might struggle to recognise some elements of the ancient port today, which have seen it propelled from one of Edinburghrsquos lower cost areas to one of its most desirable.Indeed, itrsquos so dferent, that some have argued its regeneration has gone too far, with claims that the once gritty area known for its sense of community and unique role on the fringe of the capital has become lsquogentriedrsquo, its historic assets stripped by property developers and leisure groups.Recent debate in the port has raged over suggestions that local people are being lsquopushed outrsquo of the area by rising prices and new developments.Last year a Scottish Government-backed study of the area raised concerns over rising property prices and the impact on local people whose families had lived in Leith for generations, attempting to remain.The study findings, along with a controversial poundm plan for hotel, student accommodation and leisure facilities on Leith Walk, sparked a Save Leith Walk campaign which has attracted backing from writer Irvine Welsh, The Proclaimers and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.Campaigners last month presented a , signature to Edinburgh City Council claiming development of the area will damage local business and unravel the arearsquos heritage and community.Meanwhile, there are even plans for a National Lottery-funded play, provisionally entitled Displaced, which is expected to explore the impact of development on the area. It is due to be staged next summer, to coincide with theof tramworks to the area.The online exhibition includes several photographs of Leithrsquos old tram network as well as steam engines waiting for passengers at Leith Central Station, which closed in .Councillor Ian Perry, Councillor Ian Perry, Education, Children and Families Convener, said: ldquoThis is a most interesting collection of images from Leithrsquos rich and ied past, dating as far back as the th century, and sheds light on so many aspects of the arearsquos social history."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-women-on-banknotes-have-the-power-to-improve-society","story":"The bank is painfully aware of this, of course, to the extent that it has even floated the idea of ditching the RBS moniker in favour of something less ldquotarnished. While some within the organisation obviously believe that such a big gesture is necessary for RBSrsquos ongoing rehabilitation, other steps the bank is taking are likely to help it get there in less grandiose fashion.Indeed, you only have to take a look at the notes the bank has issued in the years since its near-collapse, all of which feature the image of a woman, to get an idea of the kind of organisation RBS would like to become. After putting writer Nan Shepherd on its pound polymer note in , the bank used an image of astronomer and mathematician Mary Somerville for the pound version it released a year later and has now followed that up by putting entrepreneur Kate Cranston of Willow Tearooms fame on its new-issue pound note.After nearly  years in which only men - and well-connected men at that - were thought worthy of such an honour, you may think it is about time that women were given their turn. Coming as it does from an institution that just  years ago epitomised all that was wrong with the testosterone-fuelled macho world of business, though, this is about so much more than simply giving women a shot. It is about showing that RBS has changed into an entity that is not only self-aware but, crucially, is aware of the world it inhabits too.For too long the notes printed and distributed by banks have given the impression that that world is one where only men matter, or at least where only menrsquos achievements are worth taking note of. As journalist and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez said when challenging the Bank of Englandrsquos  decision to replace prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on its pound notes: ldquoAn all-male line-up on our banknotes sends out the damaging message that no woman has done anything important enough to appear.Our towns and cities are full of images and symbols of what countless men have achieved, with the naming of streets and chiselling of statues conferring Men of History status on them in the process. Women have not been afforded this luxury and, with some exceptions that remain woefully few and far between, their many achievements have gone unnoticed. This was highlighted by Willow Tea Room Trust chair Celia Sinclair when she said at the launch of the new RBS pound note that while Kate Cranston was an ldquoexcellent businesswoman who changed attitudes, in her day she really wasnrsquot all that unusual. ldquoThere were many women like Kate Cranston around at that time, but history simply doesnrsquot remember them, Ms Sinclair noted.That society has been able to forget those and countless other women is damaging because while it risks giving women the impression that they have nothing to live up to, it also perpetuates the myth still believed by some men that they simply havenrsquot achieved anything worth commemorating in the first place. All little girls need positive role models to give them the belief that they can grow up to be whatever they want to be, but it is just as important for equality that little boys know that women fulfil important roles too. I hadnrsquot realised quite how important until the day my then three-year-old son, who up until that point had only ever been seen by a female GP, couldnrsquot get his head round the fact the doctor we were off to see was going to be a man. Seeing is believing, though, and after that visit he took me at my word when I said that, just like women, men too can be anything they want to be.Which is why it is so important that Nan Shepherd, Mary Somerville and Kate Cranston, whose histories show what women can achieve in the arts, science and business worlds, have not just been commemorated but have been commemorated in a way that ensures all of us will come into contact with their images again and again and again. As RBSrsquos Scottish chair Malcolm Buchanan said when he unveiled the Kate Cranston pound last week, the bank feels that ldquoa banknotersquos value is more than just the figure printed across its front - it is our symbol, which lives in peoplersquos pockets and touches everyday lives.A statue in a part of a town that a fraction of us will visit or a portrait on a wall that only some of us will pass by is one thing, but an image on a note that will fall out of birthday cards and get passed from person to person as we go about our daily lives has the potential to have a far greater impact on our collective consciousness.RBSrsquos inclusion of women on its notes may have come at a time when banks in general are making plans for a cashless society, but there are still tens of millions of them in circulation and it is no exaggeration to say that in an incremental way the move will help to make society better for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"apa scoops 50k mackie s donation","story":"North east ice cream firm Mackie#s of Scotland have given a bumper #, donation to Aberdeen Peforming Arts.The Westertown-based firm have agreed to donate £, and will add a further £, per year over the next three years to the charitable organisation behind the operation and the refurbishment of the Aberdeen Music Hall.The vital funding will go towards the venue’s creative learning hub – and it will help broaden access to the arts, support youth arts and develop aspiring and established musicians in Aberdeen for years to come.Jane Spiers, chief executive of Aberdeen Performing Arts said: “The Music Hall transformation is ensuring that it will continue to be at the heart of the city’s cultural scene for many years to come“Mackie’s very generous donation is a further extension of our strong relationship.“We have a great working relationship that included supporting last years’ Granite Noir and True North festivals, and this additional investment in the Music Hall is a further fantastic endorsement of our work in communities and with children and young people.“Plans are already well underway for the re-opening of the Music Hall after an ambitious, multi million pound transformation that includes vastly improved street to seat access, a new creative learning studio, performance studio, café bar, reception, upgraded auditorium and back of house facilities and historic fabric repairs.”The -year-old Music Hall building is reopening later this year after an intensive multi-million pound makeover to ensure it can continue to deliver a busy programme of works for generations to come, in the finest surroundings.Karin Hayhow, Marketing Director and one of the firm’s three sibling owners, said: “We’re all looking forward to a visit to The Music Hall when it reopens after such an ambitious renovation project.“The new performance and educational opportunities this will bring is exciting for Aberdeen.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting.

We have a short season and need to capitalise on all markets.\"Green MSP John Finnie recently accused the council of pressing ahead with the closure of toilets in the face of its own evidence that it could have an impact on public health. An equality impact assessment conducted into the proposals identied issues for older people, those with disabilities and pregnant women.Mr Finnie said: \"Despite this, the council leadership are determined to press ahead in their usual incoherent manner, ignoring procedures, policies and good practice.\"Given the clear implications for public health, and potential for increased instances of public nuisance, it is astonishing that the council has not discussed this matter with NHS Highland and Police Scotland.\"Tuesday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118016.jpg","title":"Marathon trek pays off for charity","story":"A THURSO man has raised more than pound for charity by walking coast-to-coast across Scotland.Douglas Fraser decided to raise awareness of prostate cancer and raise money at the same time.\"As I enjoy walking I decided to do a coast-to-coast walk across Scotland and ask the public to donate money.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Tuesday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmA special fund to help retell the remarkable tale of the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow almost  years ago has been launched by Orkney Islands Council .

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much. I hope people will involve and immerse themselves in these events as much as they can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the moment I am in touch with an old colleague who has done work like this in the past.\"It would be good to see the bridge reinstated, as it is a worthwhile amenity and opens up the walk around the town giving access to the bird le on the mud flats.\"Every week, the question is asked by somebody, lsquowhen will the bridge be reopenedrsquo and we would love to give them a date but for now all we can do is open a crowdfunding page to seewe can try and make it happen ourselves.\"Similarly, we need to raise funds for a survey on the MacDonald Monument. In order to try and open the to satisfy the Highland Councilrsquos many conditions for safe access.\"These are both long-running issues, whichthey came to fruition, would be assets to the town.\"The community council remains committed to seeing both of these projects through to completion and with the help of Highland Council and the local population we see no reason why this cannot be achieved.\"According to Mr Shepherd the plans are to replace a large part of the bridge with \"old recycled crane boom sections and hopefully, my contact can find some more to help out with the project to replace the old bridge over the canal.\"Fellow member of Dingwall Community Council, George Murray, said: \"There have been so many complaints regarding the bridge being closed that the issue has been constantly on the community council agenda.\"Itrsquos an important feature of the lsquoRound Dingwall walkrsquo and needs to be repaired and reopened.\"We have an area of scenic beauty that the public cannot access without walking along and crossing over the railway tracks.He added: \"Whilst I appreciate that the Highland Council seem to be having trouble funding anything outside of Inverness, this should not be a lsquobridge too farrsquo and we will be looking at all ways to fund the repair which could be helped by the Dingwall Common Good Fundpossible.\"Tuesday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am. Work is expected to be complete by late next month.Tuesday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges. He also wished us all a happy evening together. We remembered with fondness, all those who were no longer with us, and especially J.K.Inkson himself, to whose memory all drank a fitting toast.\"Warm thanks were also expressed to Sandra Collard who helped maintain contacts and organise the event and Marie-Anny who \"emulated mdash and surpassed mdash her fictional compatriot, Monsieur Poirot, in locating so many of our Belgian friends\".Although Marie-Anny was the only surviving Belgian veteran who felt able to undertake the long journey to Ross-shire, Mr Robertson said: \"There has been a great exchange of email addresses, and it looks like the ether will be buzzing with electronic correspondence between old friends in Britain and Belgium.\"Well done, Marie-Anny and Sandra, for giving us one of the most memorable days of our lives, and thank you Alistair, for your magical photographic memories of this wonderful occasion!\"Tuesday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Tuesday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Grown in sunlight, without hydroponic lights, and sprayed with a fine mist of salt water from the sea nearby. They taste and smell like the tomatoes we grew up with,” she says. A tomato whose taste is down to the concentration of minerals in soil enriched by millennia of stratication of lava, and as she talks, she’s taking me on a journey where taste is all about time. In a world of rolling news and   Twitter feeds, with , people following her Instagram posts, a new restaurant opened this year and another opening next month, “call it five” books to her name and another out this month, chef and food writer Gizzi Erskine wants us all to slow right down. That’s why her new cookery book is called Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over, designed to teach the art of slow cooking and how to serve up stews, soups and hearty sauces. She’s fed up with quick cheats and cutting corners and wants us to prod the produce, take time trying out techniques and linger lovingly over the creation of a kale, spinach and ricotta conchiglioni. It’s time to stew, braise, bake, poach and roast.“We are so short of time in our lives that we forget that cookery does take time,” she says. Not that one of the first proponents of the pop-up restaurant doesn’t have time for fast food: “Sometimes you’ve just got to have something on your plate instantly, so you batch cook at weekends and have quick ready meals for the week. But I think losing yourself in the cookery process is therapy as well.”Taking time out to enjoy the process is close to Erskine’s heart after a busy year that started with her opening her first solo restaurant, The Dining Room, at Mare Street Market in a former office block in Hackney, and will end with the opening of vegetarian burger chain, Filth, a joint business venture with model-turned-nutritionist Rosemary Ferguson aimed at delivering healthy food to hedonists. The pair met at a festival, music being a passion of Erskine’s from hosting a cookery and cabaret stage at Latitude to what she calls a “penchant” for musicians, including Klaxons rocker Jamie Reynolds who she dated and split up with in . All this and her latest book, out this month, Gizzi doesn’t appear to be someone to whom you’d attach the adjective “slow”. After leaving school at  and home at , Gizzi – short for Griselda – was in a hurry to get on with le and success came early. While working as a body piercer in Camden, she trained at Leith’s School of Food and Wine in , graduated top of her year and won an internship at BBC Good Food magazine, writing and styling while working in kitchens and starting her own catering company. With her psychobilly flicky eyeliner and beehive hairstyle she was made for TV, and Channel  gave her her own show, Cook Yourself Thin, followed by Cookery School and Drop Down Menu. More TV followed with Sky Living. At the same time, she was turning out cookery books including Gizzi’s Kitchen Magic and Skinny Weeks  Weekend Feasts as well as writing for magazines and newspapers including InStyle and Sunday Times Style. And then there were the pop-ups, from a gourmet pie shop to food inspired by the New York Korean hole-in-the-wall scene, and one in Edinburgh during the Festival.But it’s time to slow down and talk about Slow. At , Erskine is at pains to point out she has been doing this for a long time. “I just wanted to be respected for the job I do it’s not just about how I look. I work very, very hard, I’m probably one of the hardest-working people in the industry. I’m good at my job and want people to recognise it. And I think that’s why people like Mark Hix, Angela Hartnett and Tom Kerridge, all the big guns, have always taken massive care of me, and that’s because they trust me as a cook. I dunno, it’s probably all my own shit to be honest, in my own head, but I just feel like I’ve been doing this for a long time now.”Erskine’s big purpose is to get us to slow down, embrace ingredients and technique – and for her own part, she also wants to be taken more seriously. Always a huge fan of methodology, she found the quick and easy recipes approach demanded by media for cookery frustrating. “I’m like, ‘You know what, I’m a chef, a real chef, and I really enjoy the process of cookery and I love technique – it’s what I get my kicks from’. “I’m really pleased with this book,” she says. “You know when you talk about rock stars making a brilliant album with a load of banging hits, that’s what these recipes are like. Often you lose something in a book, but they’ve kept my voice.“And one of the great things is it’s the first one I’m not on the cover. I’ve begged not to be on the cover of every single one – I think it’s a celebrity chef thing – but I don’t buy those books, I buy ones written by proper cookery writers or real old school chefs. “I want this book to stand for something. I don’t want it to be just like I’m spoiled and I’ve been on the telly and can write lovely recipes. I actually have a big purpose and I want to get out there and make changes,” she says. Not that Erskine doesn’t care about the visuals – like the shiny bob that replaced the beehive a couple of years ago – but she’s moved on from Cook Yourself Thin and Skinny Weeks  Weekend Feasts, having a more complex take on body issues these days. Of a recent post online where she mentioned putting on weight, she says: “I did that without thinking, but , people responded, so it touched a lot of people. But I don’t want it to be a thing that defines me. I put on that weight because I worked my arse off this year, setting up businesses, writing a book and helping build a house. It’s been an exhilarating, tiring  months and I lost my way in my diet. Is that the biggest thing you’ve ever been through  Absolutely not. Do I stand for more than this  Yeah! You know what, I don’t want to talk about it any more because I don’t think it’s very feminist. “Obviously my image and having a certain style has been a part in what I do and that’s been brilliant I probably wouldn’t be doing what I do without it. I’ve done a lot of TV – the last one was a Korean show for BBC One, My Seoul Food, where I got to live in Korea for four months, maybe one of my best experiences of all time. And I got to work with Idris Elba and Paloma Faith and Rankin on Sky  HD, and I pinch myself every day about that sort of thing. But the stuff I like best is educating people, showing them new things. “I’ve been doing this for more than  years, and won awards before I did TV, I’ve written a column for the Sunday Times for almost three years. I’ve earned my stripes. I’m a perfectionist and meticulous and I really want to be known for being good. That’s the first and foremost thing.”The wake-up call that her style was being valued over her stew came for Erskine when her annual appearance in the Evening Standard newspaper’s , Most Influential List saw her listed under “Party Girl” rather than “Food”. “I was like, f***, that is the worst thing! It’s my choice to do social media, because I love my fans and the fact I can have conversations with them, but when your lestyle choices make people see you dferently that’s no good. It was my fault and I deserved it. I thought I want to be recognised for doing my job, and I am good at my job, and it was important I stuck with it and showed how much I respect my industry. “Now I’m back in the Food section,” she says, satisfied, “have been for the past three or so years.” During her childhood, the family travelled a lot because of her mother’s﻿ work – Erskine and her two sisters spent time in Thailand, Switzerland and Spain after her parents’ orce. As Erskine puts it now, with a laugh: “I’ve had a very weird upbringing, there’s lots of weird shit gone on.” Food was always part of her le, with her mother teaching her recipes – her influence is in the new book. There’s also the Scottish grandmother from Edinburgh, Mona, a brilliant cook who married a Polish Jew who escaped the Nazis, and flitted between Communism, clairvoyance and Buddhism. She died when Erskine was a child, but came through to Erskine years later when she visited a spiritualist. “They said ‘Mona’s here’. I was still piercing at this stage and she said either you or your mother need to cook, because you both want to, so I went home and asked my mother what it was all about. She said, ‘That’s your grandma’, and it was on the nose. Mona has come through again, this time in the book with a Jewish chicken soup recipe.” Erskine’s father was also Scottish, from Dumfries, and she lived there briefly when she was very young. She still calls Scotland “the motherland”, priding herself on her mince recipe.It was the death of Erskine’s father on the day of her first GCSE exam that saw her leave school immediately at . “School wasn’t for me anyway,” she says, “and it turned out later that I had ADHD, which made sense. In  Erskine was officially diagnosed with the disorder and she’s very upfront about how cooking helps and is helped by it.“I can be hyper-focused and hyperactive at the same time, probably everyone ’s nightmare. So I’m either distracted and it’s knock me on the head to get attention, or bouncing off the walls and I find it very hard to listen. So cooking is like exercise, it’s therapy for me. “There’s also a side where I felt too clever for school, which is really knobby, and no-one really explained the importance of education. I was a bit of a dick in that I chose to leave but I was a nightmare at , going out, having a wild time, and my father died, so it was a bit of an excuse for me not to go back. “I was devastated by his death, but I didn’t face it. It took me five to ten years to really accept it. I put my head in the clouds and wanted to party. But now as a grown up, I don’t necessarily believe leaving school was the worst decision. “What would I have doneI’d stayed  Gone to art school maybe, but I don’t think I would have learnt as much as I did going out to work. I started piercing when I was  and I loved it and it set me up with the particular skills that I learnt from and transferred to cookery. That sounds like a ridiculous synergy, but I learnt things like wanting to be the best and investing in something, going on courses to improve. It was a brilliant lesson in how to be good at something,” she says.Erskine still loves piercing but has reduced her own ironmongery from  or  to just the one. As to its whereabouts – “I’m not going to tell you that.” She laughs. After seven years of piercing Erskine decided to pursue her love of cooking and enrolled at Prue Leith’s prestigious London cookery school, still piercing and working in restaurants to fund her studies. “My family is quite bohemian and we were very broke,” she says. “I lived on my own and ended up squatting, doing school in the day then in kitchens every night, and piercing and restaurants at the weekend, and yeah, probably partying too hard. So I lost it, I was just so exhausted.” Physically and emotionally something had to give and Erskine thought about quitting, but the school wanted her to stay and loaned her the fees for the last term. “They were so kind and saw something in me, so I was like f***, I’ve gotta do this!” Success followed, but nothing has given Erskine more satisfaction than her first solo restaurant at Mare Street Market, where she was hands-on in the kitchen until preparations for veggie burger eatery Filth took her away recently.“Cooking really good food people are coming back for… It was something I took a long time to get my head around, whether I wanted to be involved in business or not, but it’s been really satisfying and confidence-boosting,” she says. With Mare Street Market under her belt, she’s putting the finishing touches to the sustainable burger enterprise and is evangelical about the vegan burger she’s concocted with sidekick Ferguson. “We’ve spent a lot of time messing around over a cauldron,” she says. “We’ve made this patty that’s a real game-changer. Totally vegan, it feels similar to a traditional beef burger but has more protein, fibre, nutrition, and all the umami. I sound a bit Miss World,” she laughs, “but I’d love to make an impact with it, because what we eat is crucial and it’s time for a revolution in food.” So with a busy year behind her, Erskine might be forgiven for retreating to the warehouse she’s converting in Hackney with her ex-boyfriend, curling up with her cats Kimchiand Ponzuand taking time out to slow cook a ragu. “No! I’ve got another interview to do, five minutes ago!” she says, before briefly explaining her domestic set-up. “We were together for ten years and then broke up for five and now we’re building a house together. We’re best friends now, and it’s a lovely little set-up. We love each other, it’s great,” she says.With  just around the corner Erskine is happy with her le as it is. “I feel ageless. I don’t feel the need to settle down and have kids. I’m really satisfied and have a very fulfilled le and get kicks from so many things. I don’t have time for anything . “I’d like to do more cookery books but I want them to be for the right reasons. I don’t care about just churning them out. I want to spend time thinking about the next step, spend time making it good.” Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over by Gizzi Erskine is out now, published by Harper Collins at £©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4821525.1540844399!/image/image.jpg","title":"jamie cooke scotland is on the brink of a new scottish enlightenment","story":"Scotland can create a new philosophical revolution to rival the achievements of David Hume, Adam Smith and others during the Scottish Enlightenment of the th century, writes Jamie Cooke.During the heady days of , when the country was immersed in the debate around Scotland’s constitutional future, a recurring question that arose was whether we were at the beginning of a new Scottish Enlightenment.Regardless of where you stood on the question of independence, the unparalleled levels of public engagement and debate seemed to indicate an appetite for a new conversation about how we wanted society toand the principles that we wanted to underpin it, many of which were shared across the constitutional ide. The challenges we face around the changing nature of work, globalisation, inequality and automation create a space for new ideas to grow and to be tested, to open up new opportunities.It’s fair to say that in the years since the referendum the challenges have continued to grow, and indeed have been added to as we head towards the uncertainty of Brexit and its long-term impacts on the country. We’ve seen some change in approach and thinking in response to this – the Scottish Government’s leadership around the concept of basic income being one of the most innovative examples – but it also seems that the new Enlightenment has not quite happened. The desire is there, but the actuality of bringing it to fruition seems to still be waiting to reach a tipping point.: Jamie Cooke: A basic income for all is not deadAt RSA Scotland – the Scottish arm of the global Royal Society for the encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce – we believe that this tipping point is now. We are an organisation founded during the Enlightenment on the very principles of humanism, autonomy and universalism which have such a critical role to play in the challenging world we are in. Work is changing dramatically, and economic insecurity has become one of the defining features of the modern economy. Punitive approaches to social security such as Universal Credit have created hugely negative impacts for citizens, and fail even on their own narrow objectives. International collaboration feels weaker than it has done for many years, as ious governments follow protectionist programmes at the expense of mutual benefit. And the looming catastrophe of climate change is already forcing communities to have to move away from lands disappearing under the waves, or to suffer extreme weather conditions which lead to loss of le and economic collapse.This paints a pessimistic portrait of the world, but we strongly believe that turbulent times can also be the spur for new innovation and progress. Much as the original Enlightenment was a powerful response to the dark times which preceded it, our challenges today require us to create new thinking. A new Scottish Enlightenment would build on those original principles, particularly in its openness to the rest of the world, and would harness the power of technology and communication for the common good. It would utilise new deliberative forms of democratic engagement which can revitalise our politics. It would see us renew our social contract to one of opportunity and security, rooted in policies such as basic income which are humanistic, universal and trust the autonomous decisions of our citizens. It would turn the development of automation and articial intelligence from threats to opportunities, to reconnect us with good work and an appreciation of the iety of ways that people make a dference to society, such as caring and volunteering.: Five Scottish philosophers who helped shape the worldWe were therefore delighted earlier this month to have the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon deliver her keynote speech on Brexit at our historical headquarters in London. What was crucial for us was that the First Minister started her speech by celebrating the Enlightenment principles which are shared by the RSA and the Scottish Government, and called for them to be a renewed focus for policy making. This is not a party political statement – for us at RSA Scotland it is a responsibility for all parties, civic society, academia, business and the wider Scottish public, to rise to the challenges which confront us. It shows that there is an appetite in Scotland for truly embedding Enlightenment thinking into our decision making processes, to broaden out our civic engagement. It’s a big call, but one which could fundamentally change our country.So how do we move from talk to action  It will, at heart, be a collaborative effort – no one group or organisation can claim the principles of the Enlightenment for themselves. At RSA Scotland, with our erse and inspirational Fellowship in Scotland – part of nearly , Fellows across the globe – we are opening up the opportunity to make this a reality for the rest of Scottish society. We want to work with you to help take this forward, to update the thinking for the st century, and to identy how we can tangibly change society by turning ideas into action. We want to convene a gathering on the new Scottish Enlightenment which will be seen as a powerful, society-wide response to the dark times we are in, and a positive statement of the future we want to create. In the Great Room of theRSA House, where the First Minister gave her speech, the walls are covered with the famous series of paintings, Progress of Human Knowledge and Culture by James Barry. Showing the journey of humanity from darkness – and the risk of ing there once again – it offers us an inspiring call to action for the st century. As once before Scotland played a critical role which outweighed our size and location in the world, we believe that once again we can do so, and that out of these challenging times a new Enlightenment can be our response.Jamie Cooke is the head of RSA Scotland.

The wolves achieved this through predating grazing animals, which in turn took pressure off young trees and helped kickstart the recovery of a lost forest. The forest then grew up along rivers that in some cases changed course.But keystone species don’t always have to be apex predators, they can also be ones which physically create habitats in which hundreds of other animals and plants can play out their lives. The humble seaweeds known commonly as kelp are such species. Their keystone role is so important that, last week, Sir David Attenborough spoke out on the need to protect kelp from the industrial-scale harvesting proposed in Scotland’s inshore waters. Sir David was unequivocal in his statement that the dredging proposals are a “wholly short-sighted measure that risks the wholesale devastation of our kelp beds”.: Mechanical dredging for kelp would be environmental vandalism, MSPs toldKelp forms underwater ‘forests’ that provide food and shelter for myriad marine le including sea squirts, anemones, molluscs, worms, brittlestars, prawns, soft corals, sponges, amphipods and fish such as lumpsuckers, saithe, pollock and wrasse. They also provide us with an array of benefits by sequestering and storing carbon, providing breeding grounds for commercially important fish and protecting coasts from storm damage. Remove kelp and we remove an entire living ecosystem – hence Sir David’s unusually forthright appeal.The kelp harvesting proposal has been made by the Ayr-based company Marine Biopolymers, who wish to dredge , tonnes of kelp a year along Scotland’s west coast. Harvested kelp is valuable for processing into a carbohydrate called aginate, used in iety of dferent products from salad dressings and ice cream to shampoo, toothpaste, and pharmaceuticals.Consultations on the proposal are ongoing but Green MSP Mark Ruskell successfully amended the Scottish Crown Estate Bill during the second stage of its current passage through parliament with a clause that effectively bans harvesting techniques that prevent plants from re-growing. If this amendment survives stage three of the Bill, it may well render the Marine Biopolymers proposal redundant. Many would celebrate such an outcome, not least those who have businesses that depend on healthy coastal ecosystems, including those who gather kelp using sustainable, hand-harvesting techniques.: Jonny Hughes: We should encourage conservation beyond deer and grouseThe kelp drama illustrates perfectly the new contract we need to negotiate with our natural environmentwe are to have a sustainable, prosperous future. On the one hand, we have a proposal which could plunder a valuable resource, leaving it so damaged that its future value will be lost. This is exactly what happened with Scotland’s herring fishery, which from a peak of  million barrels in  collapsed to nothing by the s. Alternatively we can look after the vital stocks of natural capital within our kelp forests and seek instead to realise the idends these stocks will providemanaged responsibly. Some of that value might be direct financial flows, for example from products manufactured from hand harvesting. Some of that value will be less obvious but even more vital, such as natural coastal defences, carbon storage and protection of breeding grounds from which we derive world-beating, nutritious seafood.The kelp debate is a chance to show we can sht from a model of plunder to a model of stewardship in our marine environment. Let’s make that move.Jonny Hughes is Chief Executive of the Scottish Wildle Trust.

Not because we wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder with Nigel Farage # a man we had, and have, nothing in common, politically, industrially, or ideologically, writes Mick Whelan, the union#s general secretary.Instead, it was because we believe the EU has become a rich man’s club which offers plenty for the boss class – but very little for the ordinary hard-working men and women trying to earn a living in this conservative age of austerity.I’ll be frank. We didn’t realise that the Tory government was going to make such a horse’s arse of leaving. I was a district organiser for Aslef before I became general secretary, and I know that our isional organisers and company council reps are much, much better negotiators than the risible lightweights Theresa May has sent to try and do the business in Brussels. And, while I know she was a remain supporter during the referendum campaign, she did famously say “Brexit means Brexit, and we will make a success of it”.Now there were cynics who suggested that “Brexit means Brexit” was one of the more fabulously fatuous remarks of our times. But many of us took it to mean that there was no going back, and that May would be able to do a deal that was good for Britain. That, after all, was the promise she made.But it doesn’t look, right now, asshe will be able to do a deal at all. And any deal which she does put before Parliament looks asit will fall far short of what Boris Johnson, Liam Fox, David Davis and the other Brexiteers promised during the referendum campaign just two years ago.: No-deal Brexit an ‘absolute nightmare’ for economyAt the heart of our objections to the EU were a couple of proposals which we knew would be bad for Britain, in general, and bad for the railways, in particular – the European Commission’s Fourth Railway Package and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnershipwith the United States.The Fourth Railway Package is a controversial set of proposals which would foist the British model of rail privatisation on the rest of Europe. We know privatisation does not work. It’s not the right model for Britain and it’s not the right model for Europe. But this package, which despite the reservations of many MEPs, and protests from rail workers across the continent, is the one the neo-liberal ideologues at the heart of the EU are determined to foist on people whether they want it or not. It will turn what we see as a public service into an opportunity for a few firms to plunder a private profit.Because privatisation has not worked, does not work, and will not work in what is a natural monopoly. The model is broken and is selling Britain – passengers, taxpayers, and those of who work on the railway – woefully short. In the last -odd years, since John Major privatised our industry in the s, we have seen our rolling stock get older, our trains get more crowded, and our fares go right through the roof. We now have the highest passenger fares in western Europe. Why  Because of privatisation!: Brian Wilson: May must ditch DUP and its ‘blood red line’ over BrexitTTIP was a free trade and investment treaty being negotiated, in secret, between the EU and the US. It was, and is, unnecessary, as the EU and US already enjoy strong trade and investment relationships, with tarfs at minimal levels. So why are some companies so keen to see this new deal signed  Because the aim was to remove barriers which restrict the profits transnational corporations can make.The problem, of course, is that what global corporations perceive as barriers include vital regulations protecting our labour rights, food safety and banking safeguards. It might be handy for a profit-hungry corporationit didn’t have to comply with pesky social and environmental regulations but it would not be very good for the rest of us. TTIP appeared to wither away – first there were problems in the European Parliament and then Donald Trump seemed to prefer to pursue his aggressive America First policy – but there are signs that this zombie deal has been resurrected behind the scenes.Britain’s public health and education sectors have suffered gradual privatisation and TTIP will only accelerate this transformation of our public services into privately run sectors. For those who want to make a private profit at public expense.As the aim of Brexit is to take back control of our destiny, it would be totally wrong to sell the people out to the EU or the US. We do not want a Brexit deal with the EU which would make it easier for companies to source goods and services from countries, such as the US, where labour standards are lower, or to eradicate workers’ rights, such as collective bargaining and our right to organise, on the grounds that they restrict a company’s business model and its profit margins.Remaining in the single market would make our decision-making process even less democratic here in Britain as we would still be bound by EU directives without having a voice around the table as they are drawn up. Norway, often touted as a possible template for Brexit, incorporates single market rules as they are made in Brussels and Strasbourg. And we should remember that a recent Norwegian government report concluded that, through its single market membership, it is three-quarters integrated into the EU compared to a typical EU member country.And state aid is banned as a distortion of competition under Article . The EU Commission may grant very limited or temporary exceptions but has indicated that it is highly unlikely that these would not be granted to Britain. As we prepare to leave the European Union on  March , we need to ensure that the terms on which we leave – whatever the deal, or no deal, and however it is sold to us by Noel Edmonds, Theresa May, or Boris Johnson – does not leave us in a worse position than we are at the moment – because that wasn’t what we voted for.Mick Whelan is general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef and a member of Labour’s national executive committee.

A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Tuesday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”Eddie lts gym trophy\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8684387.1540633447!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition win up to 10 tickets for this week s calor ni leisure show","story":"Win tickets to the second annual NI Leisure Show which kicks off this Friday, November  and runs until Sunday, November .

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area. We have a population of just under , people here and they deserve nothing but first class facilities and that’s what we are delivering.“As a father and a member of the community here I would love nothing better than on a Sunday morning having a blitz here, rather than going to other parts of Belfast.

New graves are only available in Blaris cemetery when someone dies, the days of pre-planning your funeral or purchasing multiple graves are gone, we are almost at crisis point with our cemeteries.”Last year Lisburn and Castlereagh Council was tendered for a new cemetery, however the tender was unsuccessful.Cllr Corr said: “Because of boundary changes people in the Colin area are no longer Lisburn Council meaning they will have to pay more to be buried in Blaris because that cemetery  crematorium is no longer in their jurisdiction.“This is reaching crisis point, we need to have a radical approach, review and rethink around the issue of burials, cremations and cemetery spaces. We can’t wait until the day somebody is refused burial because there is no space.”With that in mind Belfast City Council have come up with the new cemeteries working group to look at these issues and to also come up with ideas around the development of our cemeteries.Cllr Corr said: “I am the party representative on the group and we are coming up with some excellent plans. For example, a new multi-million pound upgrade will be going into Roselawn crematorium.“We still need a new cemetery for North and West Belfast, it’s a very sensitive subject.“Our cemeteries are also in a position where they can become historical and tourist attractions. Look at Tom Hartley’s cemetery tours, they tell the tale of our city, from rich tombs and headstones to poor grounds where thousands of our poor are buried.“Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin is one of the main tourist attractions on the island of Ireland, it went from being a crime hotspot to being a place of beauty and interest, because it tells the tale of the formative years around the formation of the Irish Free State – our cemeteries are no dferent.“There have been books written about the City Cemetery and Milltown Cemetery.”Cllr Corr continued: “Clton Street Graveyard contains the graves of some historically signicant families, including the Dunvilles, the Sinclairs and Henry Joy McCracken, one of the leading United Irishmen. It was closed to public access approximately  years ago due to anti-social behavior. This has now decreased and the local area of Henry Place has been re-generated and a new business hub has been formed. The graveyard remains locked due to concern regarding the safety of some of the monuments. There are currently regular requests for access from tourists and visitors with a genealogical or historical interest in the graveyard.“Our social, political, economic and religious history are in our cemeteries and we need to have them as places we can use for education.“Take for example the City Cemetery heritage project, we want to bring tourists, academics and school children in as well as the local community.Our cemeteries are at their safest when people are in them, Tom Hartley’s tours have proved that.“The purpose of this working group is to give an extra edge and focus while giving the issues of graves, cemeteries and monuments the attention they deserve.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other. They are able to take their chances when they get them,” added the St James’ Swts assistant. “We also know they are the champions of this competition and they’re no going to let go of it easily. “We played them in pre-season and we won that game -, but they signed well after that game. “We know we are going to be up against it and it will be a real test. “We have to be at our best, but the way we are playing, I thinkwe show up on the day, we can win the game.” Newington will be without the suspended duo of Gavin Taggart and Kevin Bradley for Saturday’s clash while St James’ Swts are set to be at full strength for the quarter-final tie."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sf%e2%80%88asked to take","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw has called for the removal of the election-style anti-Brexit posters erected by Sinn Féin in parts of the constituency. The South Belfast MLA slammed the “unwelcome eyesore” saying they are in breach of regulations. “We saw the strength of feeling against Brexit in South Belfast and across the city aptly demonstrated by the Rally for Remain demonstration on Saturday,” she explained. “That was a clear exhibition of what most local people think about Brexit, and particularly about the ludicrous notion of leaving the EU with no future deal in place. #However, while everyone has a right to demonstrate their stance, posters, which have appeared in ious parts of the constituency are unwelcome, even by those who support the broad message on them.

As he was going off, McDonnell reacted to taunts and a plastic water bottle was thrown towards him.This led to punches thrown with several Newington players following him off the pitch as scuffles ensued. Things appeared to have calmed down with the players ing to the field, but the incident then sparked off again as McDonnell was being led to the dressing rooms. Again, players left the pitch, some it seemed were trying to calm the situation rather than join in, but the referee had seen enough, saying afterwards the chaotic scenes were out of control and he had no choice but to abandon the game.What happens now is up to the Co.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China. However it will remain docked and not take on sailings.

He later apologised and withdrew his remarks.Responding to the caller yesterday, he said: \"It was taken out of context and I used the wrong word at that time. I come from Mosul, whenever Isis took over my family was there. You could sayhostage by Isis. I had a very tricky act at how to talk to the media and keep my family safe at the same time. At that time I used the wrong words and condemned it immediately after that and I definitely dont support them.\"A short video emerged on social media of the group in KKK costumes in a JD Wetherspoon pub on Saturday night.Wetherspoons Eddie Gershon told the BBC the group was refused entry by door staff but pushed past them.\"They were told by bar staff that they would not be served. They remained in the pub for five minutes, unserved, and then left,\" he said.The KKK costumes seen at the weekend are available for €from Dublin based firm costumesinireland.ie.

The firm did not respond to requests for comment.The photos of the group were widely condemned by local politicians.

Its a brilliant country with no bombs and we need to get back to it.\"One of the most impressive designs was an intricate Belfast City Hall that could feed about  people.Creator John Hollidayfrom French Village Bakery said: \"My arm was sort of twisted into doing it. No one  was doing it and when you see the detail on City Hall, the windows behind the pillars at the top and what not, it just gave us a chance to sort of test ourselves and see what we really can do as bakers.\"Shannon More, John Holliday and Lauren Quee with Belfast City Hall by the French Village BakeryTaking  hours to make, John was helped by colleague Shannon More to carve two sponge and buttercream cakes that merged together to make the masterpiece. It even included the lights seen on the building each evening.\"When I looked at the building we had two choices: we could have done a smaller version of the whole City Hall, or just do the front face of it, which everybody recognises, and make it big enough to be able to put some detail into it. So thats what we chose to do.\"The hardest part was just finishing it.\"When it comes to putting it together, after the cake itself is made, theres another eight hours just finishing off and putting detail into it.\"The competition, in association with Ulster Architectural Heritage and Food NI, had  entrants. Judging was based on the taste and detail of the cakes and was split into amateur, professional, group, under-, primary and secondary school class.From the under-s, Katie McKeemade Bellevues Floral Hall because her grandparents met there in .She said: \"I am happy with the way it turned out but it was hard to cover the cake with the fondant. I did the steps and my mum got rice paper and printed out a floral heart and little people and we stuck them on.\"Anna Hamilton , with the help of sister Rachel , made their version of Mussenden Temple.Anna said: \"We made it out of six layers and it is a caramel cake.\"Caramel, then Rice Krispie for the dome so it was lighter for the top of the cake.\"It was quite hard to make and it took us two full days over the weekend.\"We chose the temple as we liked the symmetry of it and the fact that it was contained in circles.\"And we go up to the north coast quite often - so it was just our kind of building.\" Sara OHara and Hollie McBride, from Yellow Door, made St Patricks Catholic Cathedral in Armagh.Sara said: \"It is a huge cake. We started making it on Friday and it took Friday and just this morning to make - so it was a bit of a rush.\"Were glad it came in one piece as we were a bit nervous driving down.\"Were an Armagh company and we drove up from there today with that in the back of the car.\"We didnt make it easy for ourselves, but thats what its all about - a challenge.\"Chef Paula said: \"I think its very important to celebrate our buildings and everyone loves cake so its a genius idea, really, isnt it, to take the two. Ive had a look around and theyre actually amazing. All of them, amateur and professional, and the attention to detail as well.\"The sweetest structuresFirst place in the professional category went to French Village Bakerys City Hall, with St Patricks Cathedral made by Yellow Door Bakery coming second.The primary school category was won by Our Lady and St Patrick Primary School with Ormiston House.Down High Schools Stormont came first in the secondary school category.The amateur winner was Christine McCrudden with a Belfast Terrace.Castle Ward House was the team group winner with Castle Ward House.The under  winner was Catherine Pollen with Palm House and Anna Hamiltons Mussenden Temple was highly commended."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland kkk men posed for photo with national front leaders girlfriend","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A local Muslim who regularly uses the prayer centre said everyone in the small faith community has been left feeling very uneasy after seeing the \"shocking\" photographs.\"We have been targeted before by dferent groups. Just the other week a group of men stood outside the mosque and filmed as up to  came in for Friday prayers,\" he said.\"Its very worrying but I hope it was just fancy dress and not anything more sinister because we are already anxious.\"Yesterday residents of Newtownards were split on the issue.\"I think it was deplorable and totally inexcusable, I would lean towards viewing it as an act of terrorism,\" one man said.Another resident said the culprits \"knew exactly what they were doing\", adding: \"It was already inappropriate but then they decided to go to the mosque and actively pose for disgusting photographs.\"Others were sympathetic to the group, and insisted it was just a distasteful stunt.\"I have a sick sense of humour, and I can see why people are annoyed, but I think its selective outrage,\" commented one woman.Another said she believed the mosque was a turning point for the \"harmless banter\" that may have gone too far. \"People in this town are more scared of the men wearing balaclavas and yet our MLAs and police dont seem so keen to find out who they are,\" she added.One local, referring to Prince Harry who was snapped wearing a Nazi unorm at a private party in , questioned how anyone is supposed to know where to draw the line.He said: \"I saw someone dressed as a suicide bomber on Saturday, and there was a Jimmy Savile running around Bangor - you cant just pick one out to be offended by.\""},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic updates halloween travel information","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The ghostly figure to the left of News Letter reporter Graeme Cousins However, last week I was one of nearly  tourists walking the streets of the Co Armagh town as part of a ghost tour organised by Portadown Heritage Tours, a branch of the local Orange Order.And it was to be a ghost tour with a rather appropriate ending ... when a ghostly apparition joined the touring party for a final snap.As the tour came to an end our guide Lisa Partridge gathered us together for a group photo close to the site of the  massacre at the Bann bridge. She remarked that it was the site in Portadown where a ghost sighting was most likely.She took the snap and I thought nothing more of it until Lisa shared the photo the next day.   An artists impression of the  massacre As I scanned the image my eyes were drawn to a figure just behind me in the image that hadn’t been there when the photo was being taken.In the space between the two ladies positioned fth and sixth from the right, what looks to be a lady in profile view, with her hair pulled back, can be seen lurking in the background.I don’t believe in ghosts and my explanation would be that it’s a coincidental arrangement of leaves at the fence behind us, but all the same it did send a few chills up my spine the first time I saw it.Others in the office agreed that it did look a lot like a human form, and was certainly a lot sharper than some of the blurred images often attached to ghost stories.   St Marks Church in Portadownthe spot where the last man was hanged in the town Lisa said: “It wouldn’t be the first time a ghost has shown up in a picture taken in that area.“We took a picture last year under the bridge down at the Bann river and we picked out what looked like the outline of a mother holding the hand of her child.“It fits in with the  rebellion stories and the massacre that took place at the bridge here.Disabled toilet \u2028is vandalisedRoad closed after serious collision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“We tell people that this area is where they’re most likely to get a sighting.”   Tour guides Ashleigh Todd and Lisa Partridge The -year-old explained how she got involved in historical tours of Portadown: “I’ve always had an interest in history, but was a bit wary of finding work after a history degree, so I did business studies instead.“I came to the heritage tours from a retail background. The idea of heritage tours is we want to move the Orange Order forward.”Portadown Heritage Tours was set up with the help of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.Lisa, a member of WLOL No  in Edenderry, said: “It’s about community tourism. It’s local people telling local stories about places people walk past every day but don’t realise the signicance of them.“Our normal three tours are a town tour, a Drumcree tour and then the tours ofhall.“Through the history we were gathering from the other tours, ghost stories started appearing. The majority surrounded the  massacre at the Bann bridge during the  rebellion.“For that there was actual documentation from witnesses about the apparitions.“When you start looking for something it’s everywhere. People started coming forward with ghost stories.“We ran a ghost tour last year as a pilot and it keeps growing.“We’ve started getting into more of the stories this year.“Anyone can claim they’ve seen a ghost, so we try to seethere’s an historical event that can be linked to the sighting orthere’s been any documentation of sightings in that area, in newspapers or from other sources.”She added: “Whenever I go on holidays I always try to do a ghost tour. You get dferent ones where people get into character, but for this tour I just wanted to strip it all back and focus on the stories. “There won’t be people jumping out at you or we won’t be embellishing the stories to make them more scary.“It’s suitable for all ages, though there’s some walking involved to get to the locations around the town.”The -stop tour begins at Carleton Street Orange Hall and finishes at the site of the  massacre at the River Bann. Askedshe had ever seen a ghost herself, Lisa said: “There’s one in Carleton Street Orange Hall. I haven’t seen it personally but I’ve heard it.“It’s the ghost of William John Locke . There’s times it’s just been me and another girl in the office and % we’ve heard footsteps going up and down the stairs.“There’s times you feel like someone is watching you.“That said, I wouldn’t say it’s a scary place to work.”Askedthere had been any objections within the local order to running a ghost tour, she said: “Everyone involved with the heritage tours are members of the loyal order. “Our ethos was that the Orange Order needs to move forward, and put out the hand of friendship.“To do this we’ve opened up the doors of the hall and invited people in to come and see. It’s not an Orange museum but it’s living history.“There’s been no objection from the Orange Order to the ghost tours, in fact some of them link back to the Orange Order. As well as Locke, the last man hanged in Portadown was an Orangeman. The  rebellion also has big links to the Protestant culture, there are memorials at the site.“While there are Orange links this tour is very much cross community. The people who are coming have been   from both sides of the community.“We’ve had a lot of people coming from the west – Tyrone, Dungannon.“We don’t have a set cost yet, we just ask for donation only. Things are still at an early stage and we want to add more stories as well.”Portadown Heritage Tours which is attached to the Orange Order have been running tours of the town for the past  months.They began running tours of Carleton Street Orange Hall as well as tours of the town and Drumcree. The ghost tour came about as a result of information uncovered on their other tours.The final ghost tour of the month takes place on Tuesday at pm from Carleton Street Orange Hall.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £.

Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %.
